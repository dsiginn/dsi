It is a lesson that Padang learnt in 2009 when a relatively moderate quake struck off Sumatra's west coast. Whole villages have been destroyed and winter crops have failed in the unseasonably cold weather. Some 38 of the country's 64 districts in the north, centre and east have been at least partly submerged by one of the worst floods in years, caused by snow melt and heavy monsoon downpours in north and east India. Reports indicate that over 27 million people from 25 districts were affected by the severe cyclonic storms. Most of the deaths were caused by the tidal wave which engulfed coastal villages, or by flying debris and falling trees that crushed flimsy bamboo and tin homes -- the best that most people in the country can afford.

Typhoon Parma, packing gusts of 230 kilometres (145 miles) an hour, was forecast to hit rural areas in the north of the Philippines' main island of Luzon before dawn on Saturday. Output was reduced as a result of a shortage of irrigation water following a mild winter and poor management of water resources, with catastrophic impacts on agriculture in the down river regions of the AmuDarya, the Autonomous Region of Karakalpakstan and Khorizem, but particularly the former. On April 18, a second eruption occurred, resulting in a volcanic mudflow, also referred to as a lahar. Therefore, we request all our supporters and friends to please consider donating for these emergency food relief aids for flood victims. **May 12** A 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck in the afternoon during our aid distribution and multiple strong aftershocks followed. The Swiss Ministry for Defence, Civil Protection and Sports is also preparing to send emergency power generators and medicine. The strongest wind force measured near the centre of Tropical Depression No. 8 was at Beaufort Scale 6 (39 to 49 kilometres per hour), with wind gusting to above Beaufort Scale 6. The main types of schemes developed by SCF are shallow wells, birkas, ponds and haffir dams (earthen dams). Relief experts on the scene say unusually heavy rains during the past two months have put up to 1.8 million children and family members at risk in parts of Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia. Despite the favourable forecast for the summer (Kharif) cropping season in monsoon rains receiving areas, preliminary meteorological forecast indicates that availability of irrigation water will decline by 55 to 65 percent during the early part of Kharif season (April to June) and 16 to 26 percent in the latter part of the season (July to September) due to the cumulative effects of low rainfall seasons, including the main monsoon season. For a second time in less than a month, DPR Korea has been affected by floods triggered by torrential rainfalls produced by Typhoon Rusa. * Reduced mortality and morbidity among women, adolescents and children due to post-flood outbreak of communicable and infectious diseases. The Miyagi government said the series of major quakes had caused damage estimated at least 120 million yen (one million dollars) to the farming and fisheries industries in the area. However, there is normally a risk of late season pests such as quelea birds, sweet potato butterfly, stem-borers, African bollworm, stem rust, Welo bush cricket (affecting wheat, barley and teff), shoot-fly (affecting teff) and even locust at the end of the kiremt rains and before the main harvest. The Board approved assistance grants to five Muslim Communities in non member countries in India, USA, Malawi, Mauritius and Russia, in addition to educational grants to Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Somalia. Among the 19 provinces affected by the three weeks of storms, were the badly-hit southern Chinese provinces of Hunan and Guizhou, more famed for their chilli peppers and subtropical climate than for heavy snow. In the Broghal and Yarkhoon valleys of Chitral District (Northern Areas), some 4000 vulnerable persons are completely cut off and isolated as a result of continuous snowfall since December 2004. WHO recommends that the Government take immediate action to reduce the risk of dengue transmission and mitigate the impact of the dengue epidemic. Compared to 2003 when 60,000 people were affected, the 2004 floods has had less impact on the flood prone areas compared to previous years for several reasons; in Central Kenya, there was less rain on the Aberdare Mountains which usually overflows the dams and causes severe flooding downstream. Several small aftershocks have been registered since the quake, and information received indicate there might be further strong quakes because of the massive tectonic plate movements on 26 December. Due to rains floods and landslides have caused disruption to major road communication network in Lohit, Yingkiong, Changlang, Seppa, Anini, Roing & Along district. ""The findings attributed the poor harvest to unpredictable rainfall patterns as the rains which were less than normal and sparsely distributed started late and ended early,"" she noted. The worst flooding to hit the state in nearly 50 years followed catastrophic monsoon rains in northern and northeastern India, Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh that killed hundreds and left millions homeless.

People will need blankets and further insulation from the cold. Therefore, at request of the government and the affected population Malteser International distributes purified drinking water by boats to areas with acute water shortage in the dry seasons. Troops prepared to blow up more dikes in central China on Tuesday but were building new ones in the northeast as part of desperate waterworks surgery to defend a major city and the heart of the oil industry from floods.

However, one of the major roads connecting Yadong with Xigaze has resumed traffic and telecommunications services have been restored, as local authorities in Yadong have put an emergency power supply system into operation. Perennially irrigated agriculture under canals as well as independent sources were adversely affected during the drought. In the wake of the serious food shortages, the general Government policy for the livestock sector is to discourage mono-gastric animals which require grains for feed and to encourage increased ruminant herds, particularly goats and rabbits.

The Country Director of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Dr. Kamil Kamaluddeen has urged residents of New Kru Town to keep focus on lessons learnt and the successes that have been achieved in the fight against the deadly Ebola virus disease in Liberia. Despite the interim measures adopted by the Delhi High Court on 7 January 2010 requesting the immediate restoration of the homeless shelter and the protection of the displaced families, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi has not yet assisted them. Many people are sleeping outdoors due to unstable structures and fear of aftershocks. Households have been encouraged to make water washing stands close to their latrines, with a place for soap, so that hand washing becomes a habit. That is why the strategy has been to gradually pave the way for a richer, healthier local diet, by adding more nutritious food to it and not necessarily eliminating traditional eating habits.The meeting began at 12:19 p.m. and ended at 12:35 p.m. Presidential Statement The full text of presidential statement S/PRST/2012/9 reads as follows: ""The Security Council reiterates its strong condemnation of the forcible seizure of power from the democratically elected Government of Mali by some elements of the Malian armed forces, and recalls in this regard its press statement of 22 March 2012 and its presidential statement of 26 March 2012. *15 May 2015* From 1 January to 12 May 2015, Niger's Ministry of Public Health notified WHO of 6179 suspected cases of meningococcal meningitis, including 423 deaths.

In the a nearby industrial city of Harbin around 400 soldiers were observed near the town centre working feverishly with heavy earthmoving equipment in an attempt to plug a dike. The snow chaos, the worst in five decades, and even in a century in a few areas, have resulted in direct economic losses worth of 111.1 billion yuan (about 15.3 billion U.S. dollars) in structural collapse, blackouts, accidents, transport problems and livestock and crop losses, according to government estimates. Each day, 1,700 women go into labour and hundreds experience complications requiring life-saving medical intervention. This will be achieved by the development of an appropriate institutional framework for the effective and sustainable management of urban wastewater in Benin, preparation of a wastewater master plan for Cotonou agglomeration (Cotonou, Seme-Podji, and Abomey-Calavi) and Porto Novo, and the implementation of a small-scale decentralized sanitary drainage and wastewater treatment pilot project.
