       "    'selftext': 'Hi, first post and new here. Apologies if this is too long but I need to get this off my chest.\\n\\nI\\'ve never got along with my sister, (I\\'m 24 she\\'s 32) she always treated me like I was a hassle and never had a nice thing to say about me. I feel so isolated because the stories she tells people make me not want to show my face, people know her more so of course they\\'ll believe her over me, she even spread crap to my (already unbearable) Jobcentre work coach.\\n\\nNOTE: I\\'m struggling to move out because no landlord will have a UC claimant and the DWP are taking 1/3 of my living allowance. I am in touch with housing charities and I am trying to get help. I cant work due to extreme anxiety to the point of frequent dizzy spells, severe migraines, nausea and sometimes even passing out completely.\\n\\n9 months ago I had to leave my flat (for reasons that made me suicidal, not the first time I\\'ve been that way) and had to move in with her and her family. I had a long phase where every waking moment was so painful i struggled to breathe. I told her a few thoughts and she responded with \"I always knew you weren\\'t strong enough\". I few days later I overdosed my medication, she found me and had me rushed to A&amp;E, I was in overnight having blood tests and my heart monitored (no lasting effects) the next day she visited and complained how my attempt stopped her from making some kid\\'s birthday cake she promised she\\'d do. I felt safe at the hospital, the NHS staff were so lovely, when I got back I slowly started to improve (thanks to my wonderful nieces who took it upon themselves to mend my broken heart) and I was determined to help where I could.\\n\\nI cared for ALL the animals, and the kids. I\\'d happily cook for everyone too, I was happy for a while, but my sister started to get more and more upset with me because of how I cared for her children: mending soft toys, clipping and cleaning scraggly nails, nit treatment and combing, teeth brushing routines and regularly cleaned clothes and bedding (I worship those kids). She tells them she\\'ll help them but shouts if they ask, if I do something for them she says in their faces \"Am I not capable? Ey?\" and storms off. She bit my head off for getting them fed, cleaned and ready for bed while she slept (from 3:45pm - 9pm, past kids bedtime).\\n\\nNext morning she sat next to me on the sofa, looked me in the face with an expression that could kill and says \"You make me feel like such a lousy mother\" and again, storms off.\\n\\nMy sister lives in a pigsty and expects me to clean up after her, she tells me \"compromise goes both ways\" and I\\'m being lazy, antisocial and a general leech, I do nothing to help myself (apparently). I have decided to be ENTIRELY independent and only care for my own (me and my pets). She and her partner want me to do even more since she got herself pregnant (another one she cant look after). She wants to be with me for the good things but when I need support she shuts me down, she gets extremely stroppy if she doesn\\'t know everything I\\'m up to, If I don\\'t tell her it means I\\'m on youtube or playing Skyrim 24/7 making no attempt to better my situation.\\n\\nI feel defenceless around her, she has a very entitled know-it-all attitude that I cant stand. She tells me she hates the way I live (she must mean hygienically, and debt-free with great care for my animals, we\\'ve always been opposites)\\n\\nShe\\'s determined she\\'s right but it doesn\\'t feel right to me. What are your thoughts? Am I wrong for keeping out of her way and making sure I only provide for myself and my pets?\\n\\nSorry for my horrible ranty post, my head is a mess, I\\'m trying my best.\\n\\nThank you',\n",

       "    'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, first post and new here. Apologies if this is too long but I need to get this off my chest.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never got along with my sister, (I&amp;#39;m 24 she&amp;#39;s 32) she always treated me like I was a hassle and never had a nice thing to say about me. I feel so isolated because the stories she tells people make me not want to show my face, people know her more so of course they&amp;#39;ll believe her over me, she even spread crap to my (already unbearable) Jobcentre work coach.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;NOTE: I&amp;#39;m struggling to move out because no landlord will have a UC claimant and the DWP are taking 1/3 of my living allowance. I am in touch with housing charities and I am trying to get help. I cant work due to extreme anxiety to the point of frequent dizzy spells, severe migraines, nausea and sometimes even passing out completely.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;9 months ago I had to leave my flat (for reasons that made me suicidal, not the first time I&amp;#39;ve been that way) and had to move in with her and her family. I had a long phase where every waking moment was so painful i struggled to breathe. I told her a few thoughts and she responded with &amp;quot;I always knew you weren&amp;#39;t strong enough&amp;quot;. I few days later I overdosed my medication, she found me and had me rushed to A&amp;amp;E, I was in overnight having blood tests and my heart monitored (no lasting effects) the next day she visited and complained how my attempt stopped her from making some kid&amp;#39;s birthday cake she promised she&amp;#39;d do. I felt safe at the hospital, the NHS staff were so lovely, when I got back I slowly started to improve (thanks to my wonderful nieces who took it upon themselves to mend my broken heart) and I was determined to help where I could.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I cared for ALL the animals, and the kids. I&amp;#39;d happily cook for everyone too, I was happy for a while, but my sister started to get more and more upset with me because of how I cared for her children: mending soft toys, clipping and cleaning scraggly nails, nit treatment and combing, teeth brushing routines and regularly cleaned clothes and bedding (I worship those kids). She tells them she&amp;#39;ll help them but shouts if they ask, if I do something for them she says in their faces &amp;quot;Am I not capable? Ey?&amp;quot; and storms off. She bit my head off for getting them fed, cleaned and ready for bed while she slept (from 3:45pm - 9pm, past kids bedtime).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Next morning she sat next to me on the sofa, looked me in the face with an expression that could kill and says &amp;quot;You make me feel like such a lousy mother&amp;quot; and again, storms off.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My sister lives in a pigsty and expects me to clean up after her, she tells me &amp;quot;compromise goes both ways&amp;quot; and I&amp;#39;m being lazy, antisocial and a general leech, I do nothing to help myself (apparently). I have decided to be ENTIRELY independent and only care for my own (me and my pets). She and her partner want me to do even more since she got herself pregnant (another one she cant look after). She wants to be with me for the good things but when I need support she shuts me down, she gets extremely stroppy if she doesn&amp;#39;t know everything I&amp;#39;m up to, If I don&amp;#39;t tell her it means I&amp;#39;m on youtube or playing Skyrim 24/7 making no attempt to better my situation.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I feel defenceless around her, she has a very entitled know-it-all attitude that I cant stand. She tells me she hates the way I live (she must mean hygienically, and debt-free with great care for my animals, we&amp;#39;ve always been opposites)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s determined she&amp;#39;s right but it doesn&amp;#39;t feel right to me. What are your thoughts? Am I wrong for keeping out of her way and making sure I only provide for myself and my pets?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for my horrible ranty post, my head is a mess, I&amp;#39;m trying my best.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

My younger sister (29F) is getting married at the end of August. My brother (27M)  is having a “His and Her” baby shower with his girlfriend this weekend. I am at my parent’s house, where I grew up, currently, hoping to spend the week here leading up to the baby shower this weekend.**\\n\\nMy mother is self-absorbed. She doesn't care that my sister Katie and I were molested by my cousin Nick as a child and that I was treated like shit by my other cousin Ana (his sister) throughout my childhood and caught up in a hurtful, dysfunctional relationship with her as an adult (which ended with y cutting contact completely). My mom is more concerned with keeping “the family together” than acknowledging the damage that was done to me as a child and how it has affected me and continues to affect me as an adult. She is afraid. She is a coward. She is afraid of looking bad. She is afraid of any confrontation even if the outcome would be good for her kids. She makes up stories in her head and believes them and is afraid and paranoid. She was not an active mother to me as a child. But I did love her. She had a very happy and warm energy, and still does.  She was loving and comforting when it was convenient to her. She treated me like an inconvenience. I hated being alive. I hated who I was as a kid. I hate her. I don’t want to be around her or hear her stupid stories. I want to be away from it all.\\n\\nAccording to her, “it’s a good thing Mike (Katie’s fiance) wasn’t able to come to the baby shower because if Nick happens to be there, Mike would be really upset.” What the fuck about ME and KATIE? It doesn’t cross your mind that WE would be upset? How about last summer, when I finally told you about all of this,  and you PROMISED me that I would never ever have to worry about seeing him ever again. She would talk to Aunt Terri and Uncle Paul. She would talk to Kip, my brother,  so that he knows what’s going on. Now that has completely gone out the window. Because she is TOO FUCKING AFRAID. She doesn’t give a fuck about how I feel. It’s about everyone else and her. How SHE will look. How SHE doesn’t want to start conflict in her family. FUCK that bullshit, I want out. I am getting out. After this stupid fucking wedding I will not be around her again. I am only doing this wedding for my sister because it matters to her and I love her. I cannot stand my mother. I want to leave now but at the same time I want to push through and be at the baby shower for my brother. He wouldn’t be hurt or angry if I wasn’t there though. It’s all a fake story that I have in my mind because of my mom. I love him and he loves me but he won’t be heartbroken that I’m not there. It’s a fucking 3 hour party. \\n\\nBut I am an adult. I don’t need to be protected by her. She can do what the hell she wants with the knowledge of what happened to me. She can ignore it and have fake relationship with my aunt and cousins, just how she likes it. I won’t do it and I won’t put up with being around her while she continues to do it. \\n\\nTldr; my mother is ignoring the fact that I was molested as a kid by my cousin, for her own convenience of not having to exclude family members from upcoming family events.\",\n",

       "    'selftext': 'Growing up was hard. My twin sister and I lived with our mum. We lived in over 25 houses in the first 16 years of our lives. One particular year, we moved 4 times. The time came when we knew we would be moving again soon. The knocks on the front door would become more frequent. The hiding in our rooms or under our beds would become more frequent. The inability to answer the house phone would become more frequent. The isolation from mum\\'s \"new close friends\" would begin.\\n\\nWe would start packing up our belongings and saw it is as a competition to see how quickly we could complete this. We became experts, eventually being able to pack and unpack a house in a day. We would put the radio on and sing and dance to music as a way to distract ourselves while packing. It stopped us from dwelling on the fact that we were moving again. It stopped us from thinking about \\'why\\': mum had once again failed to pay the rent and the bills. She owed people money (her new friends, the landlords, her colleagues, her clients, or even our elderly neighbours).\\n\\nHer lies had caught up with her again and she could no longer hide behind them. She had exhausted all her favours. She had exhausted the people\\'s goodwill and they were starting to see the truth. That she had lied and manipulated them. That she had used her children and the fact that she was a single parent as a reason for them to feel sorry for her and to give her the benefit of the doubt. To let her have longer to pay them. To trust or have faith that she would come up with the money. Eventually they all came to the same conclusions. They realised that they needed to cut their losses and find a more reliable tenant. That her promises were empty. That they couldn\\'t help us even if they had tried.\\n\\nThis process continued. Over and over. Mum worked as a carer with elderly first and then the disabled. She worked as a cleaner sometimes too. She had an infectious and bubbly personality. She could make fast friends so easily. Internally and behind closed doors, I look back and can see a lady who was deeply depressed. She would often spend days in bed. She had high levels of anxiety from all the lies she was living with. She was constantly trying to function at a heightened level to keep ahead of her lies. It got to a point where I\\'m not even sure she knew the difference between the lie she had created and the truth. She was a master manipulator. This was one of her biggest assets in a way, as it allowed her to continue to exploit people to feed her problem. She did this for so many years and never truly suffered the consequences of her actions.\\n\\nWe knew mum had a problem from the age of 7. We heard whispers from our family friends. That she was addicted to gambling. The pokies specifically. My sister and I were left to our own devices from that age. We would often be at home alone. Wondering what to eat. How to get it ready. When to go to school. If she would be home to take us or if we needed to find our own way there. If she would be there to pick us up or if we needed to find our way home. This became our life.\\n\\nWe were independent from a young age, not able to rely on mum to organise things for us. We worried about her of course, as any child would. When she was gone for long periods, we thought the worst.\\n\\nHad something happened to her?\\n\\nHad she crashed her car?\\n\\nHad she been arrested?\\n\\nShe always had excuses about where she was. She had been at work. She had to stay later and longer. She was working hard to earn money to pay rent. Her car had broken down. She was helping a friend. She took someone to the hospital. The list continued.\\n\\nIn the end, we would hop on our bikes and ride from pub to pub. If we found mum\\'s car at least we would know where she was and not have to worry. We would walk the streets late at night. We would climb on the roof and look into the distance, hoping to see her coming home. We didn\\'t advertise to anyone what our home life was like. Our diet included two-minute noodles, macaroni and cheese, toast, and milo.\\n\\nSometimes on pay day, mum would do a shop and we would have food for awhile. Then it would slowly dwindle and we would go back to the basics. This has definitely impacted my diet to this day. Food has always been the lowest priority. We were used to going without.\\n\\nMum was on the wrong side of the law a few times over different periods growing up. From when we were 8, mum had some friends who could make money growing cannabis in their sheds and cupboards. The allure of money won mum over. Even though we were renting, her and her friends set up shop in the garden shed. They converted it into a hydroponic set up with the fluorescent lights and black lining over the walls. We didn\\'t think too much of it. We knew it was illegal but after the first few crops and an influx of money, mum seemed happier. We had more food than we\\'d had in awhile. We didn\\'t move house when the month came to the end so it seemed like there were more positives at the time.\\n\\nThe problem with this was that mum still had her underlying addiction. Often, she would receive the influx of cash and spend bigger at the pokies for longer. In the end, it only fuelled her problem to some degree. We continued to move house. The garden sheds got a little bigger and the crops got a little larger. We came home one day to find the crops were ready to dry out. The whole house smelt. Mum was sitting on the floor in the rumpus room with newspaper and scissors. She was cutting the cannabis. We sat down and helped her. I think we were 8.\\n\\nReflecting back on this with my sister, we laughed. We laughed at many things. We laughed at how we used to make a game of remembering the names of the streets we\\'d lived in and what order they were in from when we were born until now. We laughed at cutting cannabis with mum when we were 8. We laughed at the police and debt collectors who knocked on our doors repetitively over the years. We laughed at how mum had told them she was our aunty a couple of times and got away with it. We laughed at how mum used to change her last name. For bills, for jobs, for house applications. We couldn\\'t keep up.\\n\\nWas it Harvey or Watts or Nitsche?\\n\\nWe weren\\'t sure. It allowed her to get away with things for longer.\\n\\nLaughing, it seems, is one of our many coping mechanisms. In a way, we have compartmentalised this part of our life and locked it away. By not talking about it, we haven\\'t really dealt with our feelings and we were both afraid of the impact of this on us now and later. This is why we have decided to share our stories.\\n\\nMum was the ultimate fraudster. She was given charge of our local soccer club finances one year. I think they figured she used to work in a bank so she was good with sums. They weren\\'t to know she had an addiction and shouldn\\'t be trusted. Mum used her knowledge of banks to then spend all of our soccer club\\'s money. She got passed the need for two signatures and withdrew that money. I will never know how she got away with that and how no one pressed charges. The club folded soon after.\\n\\nAnother brush with the law came when mum was housesitting a work colleague\\'s house. Unbeknownst to us, while her work colleague was overseas, she began pawning off her belongings. Jewellery, sporting equipment, electronics and the list goes on. This showed a desperate but opportunistic woman. Of course, her friend returned from overseas. She quickly realised her stuff was gone. She went to the police and this was mum\\'s most serious encounter with the law. I remember she had to get lawyers. She went to court. The investigation and process dragged on for months. Mum was stressed and depressed. She asked our grandma to help her. Grandma gave her money. She paid for the lawyers. She bailed her out of another problem. She didn’t want us to be without mum. She didn’t want mum to have a criminal record. If only grandma could understand that she wasn\\'t doing her any favours. Mum continued to gamble. She continued to lie. She continued to owe people money. I sometimes wish Grandma had let mum suffer the consequences of her actions back then. Maybe she could have been helped. We will never know.\\n\\nIn our minds, as my sister and I became more aware of what was going on, we decided we just needed to get through school. We wanted to be better. We wanted to do better. We needed to get away from this life we were living. We had aspirations and somehow, despite our role models, we knew right from wrong. We despised lies. We despised debt. We tolerated our mum but we didn\\'t like what she had become or how she treated people. It got to the point where we didn\\'t believe a single word out of her mouth. Everything seemed to be a lie. Even if she was just talking about her day, about a conversation she had with someone. Nothing could be taken as the truth anymore.\\n\\nMy sister and I threw ourselves into our schooling and our sport. Those were our outlets. Those got us through. The times continued to be tough. We held on to the thought that if we aimed high, we could eventually walk away from all this. We had each other. We inspired each other and we always felt so lucky to be twins. It was a blessing that there were two of us to support each other whilst we struggled through this life together.\\n\\nMum started to unravel at times when her guilt and desperation reached heightened levels. She would take her stress and anger out on us. She manipulated us into feeling like a burden. Like all her money problems were because of us. She would be irrational. She would search our rooms for money. We would have to hide. We were scared when she was in these states. We would sometimes roam the streets until she calmed down.\\n\\nWe kept our lives a secret. No one knew. Not our teachers. Not our friends. We were embarrassed and in a way, we felt guilty. We had lied. We had lied to many people. It had become second nature. We put up a facade in order to get the next house.\\n\\nIn order to keep mum out of trouble.\\n\\nWe didn\\'t want her to go to jail and where would we live?\\n\\nWe weren\\'t innocent.\\n\\nWe contributed to people being hurt.\\n\\nTo people being deceived and manipulated.\\n\\nIt was wrong but we felt trapped.\\n\\nWhere else could we have gone?\\n\\nI don\\'t regret many things in life but I do regret this. We were selfish. We were in self-preservation mode. We went along with the lies, which was wrong. Many people were affected by our mum\\'s actions. Too many to name. They lost money. They had their trust broken. They even lost belongings that she sold or pawned. Some people were so vulnerable that they had no chance to even say no. The elderly, the disabled, and even her own family.\\n\\nThe last straw came many years later. Our grandma was progressing with her dementia. As the grandchildren, we didn\\'t want to get too involved with grandma\\'s finances. It\\'s usually the parents who take care of these matters when they arise. Our grandma had one daughter and one son. Her son, on our recommendation, had placed grandma\\'s money in a fixed term deposit account, not attached to her normal bank account. We had thought this would be enough to stop mum from accessing the bulk of grandma\\'s money. But we were wrong.\\n\\nMum had gotten around that and taken grandma into the bank. She got her to sign a form to put the money in her normal account and had been withdrawing that money slowly but surely over a few months. Our uncle found this out when he came over from Tasmania for a holiday. He exposed the ugly truth. That mum could sink so low that she would exploit her own family. Her mother who had helped her time and time again over the years. Her mother who had dementia and was so trusting of her. She prayed on the most vulnerable. Grandma had always believed that mum could get better. That she deserved second chances.\\n\\nWe were all angry. At mum and at ourselves. We should have known mum wouldn\\'t stop. That no one was off limits to her addiction and her lies. Since that day, we haven\\'t seen or spoken to mum.\\n\\nMy sister and I took over caring for our grandma. We love her dearly. She is now in a nursing home. Mum doesn\\'t know where she is. She has never visited her. Grandma asks about her most days. She knows what she did and it hurts her to think of what her daughter has become. For me, I feel better not having mum in my life. It\\'s definitely easier. I don\\'t have to worry what is coming next. I don\\'t have to worry about answering my phone. I don\\'t have to worry about debt collectors or friends chasing money from her.\\n\\nThe sad thing is that we don\\'t know where mum is. We wouldn\\'t know if she is dead or alive and that haunts me in my dreams.',\n",

       "    'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up was hard. My twin sister and I lived with our mum. We lived in over 25 houses in the first 16 years of our lives. One particular year, we moved 4 times. The time came when we knew we would be moving again soon. The knocks on the front door would become more frequent. The hiding in our rooms or under our beds would become more frequent. The inability to answer the house phone would become more frequent. The isolation from mum&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;new close friends&amp;quot; would begin.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We would start packing up our belongings and saw it is as a competition to see how quickly we could complete this. We became experts, eventually being able to pack and unpack a house in a day. We would put the radio on and sing and dance to music as a way to distract ourselves while packing. It stopped us from dwelling on the fact that we were moving again. It stopped us from thinking about &amp;#39;why&amp;#39;: mum had once again failed to pay the rent and the bills. She owed people money (her new friends, the landlords, her colleagues, her clients, or even our elderly neighbours).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Her lies had caught up with her again and she could no longer hide behind them. She had exhausted all her favours. She had exhausted the people&amp;#39;s goodwill and they were starting to see the truth. That she had lied and manipulated them. That she had used her children and the fact that she was a single parent as a reason for them to feel sorry for her and to give her the benefit of the doubt. To let her have longer to pay them. To trust or have faith that she would come up with the money. Eventually they all came to the same conclusions. They realised that they needed to cut their losses and find a more reliable tenant. That her promises were empty. That they couldn&amp;#39;t help us even if they had tried.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This process continued. Over and over. Mum worked as a carer with elderly first and then the disabled. She worked as a cleaner sometimes too. She had an infectious and bubbly personality. She could make fast friends so easily. Internally and behind closed doors, I look back and can see a lady who was deeply depressed. She would often spend days in bed. She had high levels of anxiety from all the lies she was living with. She was constantly trying to function at a heightened level to keep ahead of her lies. It got to a point where I&amp;#39;m not even sure she knew the difference between the lie she had created and the truth. She was a master manipulator. This was one of her biggest assets in a way, as it allowed her to continue to exploit people to feed her problem. She did this for so many years and never truly suffered the consequences of her actions.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We knew mum had a problem from the age of 7. We heard whispers from our family friends. That she was addicted to gambling. The pokies specifically. My sister and I were left to our own devices from that age. We would often be at home alone. Wondering what to eat. How to get it ready. When to go to school. If she would be home to take us or if we needed to find our own way there. If she would be there to pick us up or if we needed to find our way home. This became our life.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We were independent from a young age, not able to rely on mum to organise things for us. We worried about her of course, as any child would. When she was gone for long periods, we thought the worst.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Had something happened to her?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Had she crashed her car?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Had she been arrested?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She always had excuses about where she was. She had been at work. She had to stay later and longer. She was working hard to earn money to pay rent. Her car had broken down. She was helping a friend. She took someone to the hospital. The list continued.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In the end, we would hop on our bikes and ride from pub to pub. If we found mum&amp;#39;s car at least we would know where she was and not have to worry. We would walk the streets late at night. We would climb on the roof and look into the distance, hoping to see her coming home. We didn&amp;#39;t advertise to anyone what our home life was like. Our diet included two-minute noodles, macaroni and cheese, toast, and milo.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes on pay day, mum would do a shop and we would have food for awhile. Then it would slowly dwindle and we would go back to the basics. This has definitely impacted my diet to this day. Food has always been the lowest priority. We were used to going without.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mum was on the wrong side of the law a few times over different periods growing up. From when we were 8, mum had some friends who could make money growing cannabis in their sheds and cupboards. The allure of money won mum over. Even though we were renting, her and her friends set up shop in the garden shed. They converted it into a hydroponic set up with the fluorescent lights and black lining over the walls. We didn&amp;#39;t think too much of it. We knew it was illegal but after the first few crops and an influx of money, mum seemed happier. We had more food than we&amp;#39;d had in awhile. We didn&amp;#39;t move house when the month came to the end so it seemed like there were more positives at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The problem with this was that mum still had her underlying addiction. Often, she would receive the influx of cash and spend bigger at the pokies for longer. In the end, it only fuelled her problem to some degree. We continued to move house. The garden sheds got a little bigger and the crops got a little larger. We came home one day to find the crops were ready to dry out. The whole house smelt. Mum was sitting on the floor in the rumpus room with newspaper and scissors. She was cutting the cannabis. We sat down and helped her. I think we were 8.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Reflecting back on this with my sister, we laughed. We laughed at many things. We laughed at how we used to make a game of remembering the names of the streets we&amp;#39;d lived in and what order they were in from when we were born until now. We laughed at cutting cannabis with mum when we were 8. We laughed at the police and debt collectors who knocked on our doors repetitively over the years. We laughed at how mum had told them she was our aunty a couple of times and got away with it. We laughed at how mum used to change her last name. For bills, for jobs, for house applications. We couldn&amp;#39;t keep up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Was it Harvey or Watts or Nitsche?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We weren&amp;#39;t sure. It allowed her to get away with things for longer.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Laughing, it seems, is one of our many coping mechanisms. In a way, we have compartmentalised this part of our life and locked it away. By not talking about it, we haven&amp;#39;t really dealt with our feelings and we were both afraid of the impact of this on us now and later. This is why we have decided to share our stories.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mum was the ultimate fraudster. She was given charge of our local soccer club finances one year. I think they figured she used to work in a bank so she was good with sums. They weren&amp;#39;t to know she had an addiction and shouldn&amp;#39;t be trusted.

       "    'selftext': 'Long post. Tldr at the bottom.\\n\\nWithin the past year, I (21 f) have been slowly realizing that I don\\'t think I have a good relationship with my mom.\\n\\nFor a while, I\\'ve just felt like I need to grow up or that we just have really different personalities and it\\'s my fault I dont like to be around her. I was really excited to go to college so I didnt have to interact with her as often and, again, thought I might have just been overreacting or hormonal. I\\'ve always made excuses to not visit her since then. I usually dont text her first and when I do it\\'s because I feel guilty for not having interacted with her for a few days, not because I really want to. Sometimes when she texts me I dont even respond for a whole day. I can\\'t quite put my finger on why I feel like this but I recently realized something that might help me put the puzzle together.\\n\\nFor years my mom and my dads mom have had beef. I\\'m pretty sure this was an ordeal even before I was born. I didn\\'t really realize it was happening until I was about 15. My mom started talking mad shit about her around that time but it was never really specific. I have personally witnessed my dads mom say some shady things and so having only my own mothers side of the story I naturally sided with her. \\n\\nMy mom and dad did not have a happy marriage for very long. I remember from a very young age that they had some issues. But that\\'s a whole \\'nother can of worms to step in. I was in my mid teens when my mom started to \"open up\"  about her and my dads relationship. My dad never really talked to me (I daresay he was emotionally neglectful but again that\\'s even another can of worms) so I never really got his side of the story. My mom just said some absolutely terrible things about my dad then when she was done ranting she would say something nice about him. Hindsight it just seems like she was afraid I would say something to him so she was just trying to cover her steps but idk. The point is she got me to take her side.\\n\\nThey finally got divorced last year and my dad has been very honest with me about the whole thing. He is telling me what my mom did wrong just like my mom always (always...) tells me what he did wrong. But what he does that\\'s different than my mom is understand his own role in the failed marriage. He knows exactly where he went wrong and he is really trying to change for the better. And him opening up to me like that made me realize just how much my mom lied to me and manipulated me to hate my dad. \\n\\nThroughout my childhood she always threw shade at my friends and their families which has ultimately ruined multiple friendships, so like... more than one. Like I\\'m just realizing this as I\\'m writing this but she rarely had anything good to say about any of my friends and their families. I feel like a total asshole having taken her side so often. Again, I thought I had done something wrong but...\\n\\nI\\'m finally a semi functional person with somewhat coherent thoughts and I guess I\\'m just starting to notice a pattern. I keep my distance from my mom because she makes me uncomfortable. My mom has always thrown mad shade at my dad and his mom. My dad opening up to me realized that my mom was telling me lies about him and it just makes me wonder what she was lying about my grandmother (dads mom) and my friends. Or what kinds of lies shes saying about me to her friends. She always made me believe she had a good relationship with me but I\\'m certainly questioning that now.\\n\\nIdk, maybe I\\'m overthinking this or reading this situation wrong but it feels good to get this off my chest at least. \\n\\nTldr: my mom has said some really terrible things about a lot of the people in my life and I have always taken her side and I\\'m just now realizing why I don\\'t like being around her.',\n",

I have personally witnessed my dads mom say some shady things and so having only my own mothers side of the story I naturally sided with her. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My mom and dad did not have a happy marriage for very long. I remember from a very young age that they had some issues. But that&amp;#39;s a whole &amp;#39;nother can of worms to step in. I was in my mid teens when my mom started to &amp;quot;open up&amp;quot;  about her and my dads relationship. My dad never really talked to me (I daresay he was emotionally neglectful but again that&amp;#39;s even another can of worms) so I never really got his side of the story. My mom just said some absolutely terrible things about my dad then when she was done ranting she would say something nice about him. Hindsight it just seems like she was afraid I would say something to him so she was just trying to cover her steps but idk. The point is she got me to take her side.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They finally got divorced last year and my dad has been very honest with me about the whole thing. He is telling me what my mom did wrong just like my mom always (always...) tells me what he did wrong. But what he does that&amp;#39;s different than my mom is understand his own role in the failed marriage. He knows exactly where he went wrong and he is really trying to change for the better. And him opening up to me like that made me realize just how much my mom lied to me and manipulated me to hate my dad. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Throughout my childhood she always threw shade at my friends and their families which has ultimately ruined multiple friendships, so like... more than one. Like I&amp;#39;m just realizing this as I&amp;#39;m writing this but she rarely had anything good to say about any of my friends and their families. I feel like a total asshole having taken her side so often. Again, I thought I had done something wrong but...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m finally a semi functional person with somewhat coherent thoughts and I guess I&amp;#39;m just starting to notice a pattern. I keep my distance from my mom because she makes me uncomfortable. My mom has always thrown mad shade at my dad and his mom. My dad opening up to me realized that my mom was telling me lies about him and it just makes me wonder what she was lying about my grandmother (dads mom) and my friends. Or what kinds of lies shes saying about me to her friends. She always made me believe she had a good relationship with me but I&amp;#39;m certainly questioning that now.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Idk, maybe I&amp;#39;m overthinking this or reading this situation wrong but it feels good to get this off my chest at least. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Tldr: my mom has said some really terrible things about a lot of the people in my life and I have always taken her side and I&amp;#39;m just now realizing why I don&amp;#39;t like being around her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

A very small part of me wants to just hate her, and the rest of me is so sick of fighting that part of my mind.

       "    'selftext': 'We just had our first child three weeks ago. She is the first grandchild on both sides. My mom has made it clear she would like to see her grandchild 3-4x a week even though she will be watching her full time when I go back to work at 4 months (starting to question her watching her now...).\\n\\nMy family calls and texts constantly. My mom wants to FaceTime during diaper changes and feedings (I breastfeed) and will call and text constantly until I answer if I don’t pick up right away. Really hard with a newborn to constantly be texting...\\n\\nLast week kind of set me over the top. My family knows I have been extremely worried about germs with a newborn. My sister and mom came over last Wednesday. When my sister got here, her nose was runny and her voice was basically gone. I asked about 10 times if she was sick and she assured me she had bad allergies. The next day she threw up at 9 AM. No one decided to tell me this. My family still was planning to get together Friday.. they only canceled after she was still throwing up early Friday morning.. meaning they were going to get together knowing my sister was sick until she spent 2 days puking. \\n\\nI told my parents that since they have spent a lot of time with my sister and have been exposed I’d like to wait a week or so before getting together. My mom calls constantly crying, and begging to come see our baby. She said she’d wear a mask and gloves.. I am constantly trying to nicely tell her I’m just concerned exposing our new baby to germs. After finally getting my mother to agree that she could wait a week to see the baby- she tells me she’s also had diarrhea but it was likely something she ate. Clearly my family has been sick and they are writing it off because they want to see the baby. They have been extremely overbearing and stressing me out. \\n\\nAny advice? I don’t know how to handle this.',\n",

       "    'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We just had our first child three weeks ago. She is the first grandchild on both sides. My mom has made it clear she would like to see her grandchild 3-4x a week even though she will be watching her full time when I go back to work at 4 months (starting to question her watching her now...).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My family calls and texts constantly. My mom wants to FaceTime during diaper changes and feedings (I breastfeed) and will call and text constantly until I answer if I don’t pick up right away. Really hard with a newborn to constantly be texting...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Last week kind of set me over the top. My family knows I have been extremely worried about germs with a newborn. My sister and mom came over last Wednesday. When my sister got here, her nose was runny and her voice was basically gone. I asked about 10 times if she was sick and she assured me she had bad allergies. The next day she threw up at 9 AM. No one decided to tell me this. My family still was planning to get together Friday.. they only canceled after she was still throwing up early Friday morning.. meaning they were going to get together knowing my sister was sick until she spent 2 days puking. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I told my parents that since they have spent a lot of time with my sister and have been exposed I’d like to wait a week or so before getting together. My mom calls constantly crying, and begging to come see our baby. She said she’d wear a mask and gloves.. I am constantly trying to nicely tell her I’m just concerned exposing our new baby to germs. After finally getting my mother to agree that she could wait a week to see the baby- she tells me she’s also had diarrhea but it was likely something she ate. Clearly my family has been sick and they are writing it off because they want to see the baby. They have been extremely overbearing and stressing me out. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Any advice? I don’t know how to handle this.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

There's quite a bit to it in terms of my relationship with my dad..\\n\\nI come from an Asian family and for some reason this sometimes means we just never communicate about our emotions. My dad unfortunately lost his job due to a fire and he's been doing manual labour type jobs his whole life. He loves it but obviously it has taken a huge toll on his physical health. He's generally ok but has a lot of pain in his legs and back because of his jobs but also because of various health issues. This is important to mention because he just refuses to do anything active like going for a run or a walk if the weather is nice just to kill time.\\n\\nI feel bad for him that he's now been sitting at home for a couple of weeks seeming really bored. I would like to add he IS actively looking for jobs but not getting  anywhere because of his lack of qualifications. He occasionally goes out with his friends but obviously they all work so that's hard to do. I don't want to continue to watch him like this but equally I don't know how to talk to him about it in fear he'll think I'm just taking pity on him (this is where the whole Asian family type stuff comes in).\\n\\nWhat do you guys think I could do with my Dad to help him actually live life a little? I'm a 22 yr old female btw, currently have all the time in the world as I just graduated and don't start my Master's programme until September, so I have time to help him out.\\n\\nI hope you guys can help, thank you so much if you've read this.\",\n",

       "    'selftext': 'I\\'m hesitant to post this as I\\'ve never posted in an open forum before, but I\\'m really hoping someone might be able to give me some helpful advice on this. My older brother is 37 years old, and has been dealing with depression since his very early teens. He has been on medication this entire time, different ones prescribed by different doctors. He sees a therapist regularly. He meditates daily. Some days he\\'s okay, and can laugh every now and then. But most of time he just seems miserable and emotionless.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTo give a better perspective on our family dynamic, here\\'s an overly long paragraph about us:\\n\\nMy parents separated when I was 6 (brother was 9). It wasn\\'t a super messy split, but my dad refused to pay child support for quite a long time, and my mom ended up having to use all of her savings on court/lawyers fees to try and get him to pay. We lived with my mom (she struggled to get by for years), and saw my dad every other weekend. My dad\\'s entire life has always revolved around soccer. He lives and breathes it. Most of my childhood was spent at the soccer field: my mom played it, I played it, my brother played it for a couple years, and my dad coached women\\'s soccer teams, took teams to tournaments and ran the leagues in our city. To this day, a conversation with my dad would include a lengthy chat about soccer. I know he definitely chose soccer over visiting with us numerous times.\\n\\nIn all honesty, I don\\'t really remember my childhood being that bad, I still felt loved by both my parents. But my brother seems to think differently. He has a very heavy dislike (hatred?) towards my dad. And my mom too, but mostly my dad.\\n\\nGrowing up, my brother always did really well in school. He\\'s the smart one in the family, and has always has good jobs. He\\'s had to loan my mom money several times in his life. I think he resents her for not being able to take care of us \"properly\".\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOur family has also never been one to go out of our way to communicate with each other. We don\\'t have any deep conversations about feelings, and we never have. My mom and I are very close, and I\\'m also quite close to my dad. My brother feels like an outcast. I recently found this out when him and I had a little drunk heart-to-heart outside of a wedding celebration. He thinks he\\'s not like us, and he feels like he doesn\\'t belong when our extended family gets together. (My mom lives in a separate building on the same property as my aunt/uncle, so by extended family I mean mom/brother/me/aunt/uncle/cousins).\\n\\nWhen we\\'re together, he\\'s usually pretty quiet, although if he\\'s in an okay mood he\\'s very funny and can laugh and be sarcastic with the rest of us. He really is a lot of fun when he\\'s at his best. It\\'s rare though.\\n\\nA lot of the time he\\'s sarcastic, I\\'d say almost to a hurtful extent. I\\'ve dealt with it my entire life, so I take people\\'s insults as jokes. I\\'ve always laughed off comments that my brother made to me, even if they were true. I think my dad did the same. My mom takes my brother\\'s comments to heart.\\n\\nI\\'ve been paying attention more recently to how he acts around me compared to how he acts around my parents. I moved in with him a few months ago (temporary job), and have noticed that for the most part, he can laugh and joke with me. I make stupid comments and he laughs, it\\'s quite fun. When we\\'re around our parents, he is very different. This is when he\\'ll be quiet, moody, barely smile. He\\'ll make little jabs at my mom (like I said, she takes them to heart, I can see the hurt in her eyes when he says them), and if he\\'s around my dad it\\'s so much worse. He endlessly (somewhat subtly) tells my dad that he\\'s a shitty person. He makes so many snide remarks towards him, being completely serious, but my dad tends to laugh them off (I guess I learned this from him).\\n\\nMy dad is a hoarder, by the way. Not like the garbage everywhere kind, but he keeps everything. He has rooms piled with things (a lot of soccer stuff), and he doesn\\'t clean the house or take care of himself. I know that he\\'s recently gone a month without showering. He\\'s also slowing down in his age (71), so I\\'m worried about him.\\n\\nI think the hoarding that my dad is doing has created an even bigger divide between my dad and brother. My dad makes no effort to call/text/keep in touch with my brother. My brother barely makes an attempt at talking to my dad. Every now and then my brother will call him when he\\'s waiting to board a plane (because he knows he\\'ll have to hang up in a certain amount of time).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'ve frequently googled how to help a depressed friend or family member, and all I get are the same results. \"Tell them you\\'re there to listen, encourage them to get help, tell them it gets better\". I\\'ve told him I\\'m here to listen, he doesn\\'t want to talk to me. He\\'s been seeing a therapist for many years now, and has taken countless medications. He\\'s been depressed since he was about 14, and it hasn\\'t gotten any better for him.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHe\\'s still alone. He\\'s had a girlfriend every now and then but nothing for more than a year or so. He\\'s never been married. I know he wants to get married, I know he\\'d even like to have a kid one day. I think this gets to him a lot that he\\'s still single.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt makes me so incredibly sad to see him like this, and I don\\'t know how to help him. He truly is a great guy, and he deserves to find happiness and enjoyment in his life.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAny advice to approach this would be greatly appreciated.',\n",

To this day, a conversation with my dad would include a lengthy chat about soccer. I know he definitely chose soccer over visiting with us numerous times.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In all honesty, I don&amp;#39;t really remember my childhood being that bad, I still felt loved by both my parents. But my brother seems to think differently. He has a very heavy dislike (hatred?) towards my dad. And my mom too, but mostly my dad.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Growing up, my brother always did really well in school. He&amp;#39;s the smart one in the family, and has always has good jobs. He&amp;#39;s had to loan my mom money several times in his life. I think he resents her for not being able to take care of us &amp;quot;properly&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Our family has also never been one to go out of our way to communicate with each other. We don&amp;#39;t have any deep conversations about feelings, and we never have. My mom and I are very close, and I&amp;#39;m also quite close to my dad. My brother feels like an outcast. I recently found this out when him and I had a little drunk heart-to-heart outside of a wedding celebration. He thinks he&amp;#39;s not like us, and he feels like he doesn&amp;#39;t belong when our extended family gets together. (My mom lives in a separate building on the same property as my aunt/uncle, so by extended family I mean mom/brother/me/aunt/uncle/cousins).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When we&amp;#39;re together, he&amp;#39;s usually pretty quiet, although if he&amp;#39;s in an okay mood he&amp;#39;s very funny and can laugh and be sarcastic with the rest of us. He really is a lot of fun when he&amp;#39;s at his best. It&amp;#39;s rare though.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of the time he&amp;#39;s sarcastic, I&amp;#39;d say almost to a hurtful extent. I&amp;#39;ve dealt with it my entire life, so I take people&amp;#39;s insults as jokes. I&amp;#39;ve always laughed off comments that my brother made to me, even if they were true. I think my dad did the same. My mom takes my brother&amp;#39;s comments to heart.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been paying attention more recently to how he acts around me compared to how he acts around my parents. I moved in with him a few months ago (temporary job), and have noticed that for the most part, he can laugh and joke with me. I make stupid comments and he laughs, it&amp;#39;s quite fun. When we&amp;#39;re around our parents, he is very different. This is when he&amp;#39;ll be quiet, moody, barely smile. He&amp;#39;ll make little jabs at my mom (like I said, she takes them to heart, I can see the hurt in her eyes when he says them), and if he&amp;#39;s around my dad it&amp;#39;s so much worse. He endlessly (somewhat subtly) tells my dad that he&amp;#39;s a shitty person. He makes so many snide remarks towards him, being completely serious, but my dad tends to laugh them off (I guess I learned this from him).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My dad is a hoarder, by the way. Not like the garbage everywhere kind, but he keeps everything. He has rooms piled with things (a lot of soccer stuff), and he doesn&amp;#39;t clean the house or take care of himself. I know that he&amp;#39;s recently gone a month without showering. He&amp;#39;s also slowing down in his age (71), so I&amp;#39;m worried about him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I think the hoarding that my dad is doing has created an even bigger divide between my dad and brother. My dad makes no effort to call/text/keep in touch with my brother. My brother barely makes an attempt at talking to my dad. Every now and then my brother will call him when he&amp;#39;s waiting to board a plane (because he knows he&amp;#39;ll have to hang up in a certain amount of time).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve frequently googled how to help a depressed friend or family member, and all I get are the same results. &amp;quot;Tell them you&amp;#39;re there to listen, encourage them to get help, tell them it gets better&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;ve told him I&amp;#39;m here to listen, he doesn&amp;#39;t want to talk to me. He&amp;#39;s been seeing a therapist for many years now, and has taken countless medications. He&amp;#39;s been depressed since he was about 14, and it hasn&amp;#39;t gotten any better for him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s still alone. He&amp;#39;s had a girlfriend every now and then but nothing for more than a year or so. He&amp;#39;s never been married. I know he wants to get married, I know he&amp;#39;d even like to have a kid one day. I think this gets to him a lot that he&amp;#39;s still single.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It makes me so incredibly sad to see him like this, and I don&amp;#39;t know how to help him. He truly is a great guy, and he deserves to find happiness and enjoyment in his life.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Any advice to approach this would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

It’s always been borderline emotionally abusive, sometimes physical (my mom has thrown things at my dad and has hit him). \\nA couple years ago my dad almost died because of diabetes and is now disabled. As of now he’s prescribed oxy for the pain, and has been on it for 2 years. However, he is abusing it, and snorts it, passes out and drools on himself, etc. He has also started drinking again, at first it was just a couple glasses of wine, and now we have to hide any beer we have in the house. He’s an alcoholic, addicted to oxy, on the couch literally 24/7, and isn’t the nicest person. \\nMy mother isn’t the nicest either, I feel that she can be pretty selfish a lot of the time. For example, she hasn’t done her taxes in 2 years, gets mad when I ask her to, and I haven’t been able to apply for FAFSA. I’m always scared to say anything not positive about her behavior because she gets mad, yells at me, and insults me, usually calling me a drama queen and telling me to get over it. Because of my dad’s disability, bills are a little harder to pay because he’s not working anymore, and my mom isn’t working either. \\nI am currently going to school for social work, and a lot of the time my mom comes to me with her issues because I have the right responses. However, I don’t want to be her therapist. She will talk to me about very personal problems, sometimes even bringing up her and my father’s sex life. A few months ago she had a mental breakdown, and our house was almost in foreclosure. I was the only one in the family who knew about this besides my mom, my brother and sister had no idea. She comes to me with these issues of money, running through all of their savings, 401K, etc. She talks to me about leaving him, moving away, and needing to “put herself first for once.” She also complains about how my dad is basically just killing himself, as he also had collapsed lungs and is smoking cigarettes a lot. But my mom also smokes, and I brought up how she shouldn’t smoke either because if she ends up in the hospital like my father did, I’ll have to deal with it all, as my siblings will most definitely not be helpful. When I said this she just brushed it off and said something along the lines of “I know, your father is useless and won’t help”\\n\\nHow do I tell my mom that this is an inappropriate relationship and it makes me super uncomfortable to be expected to act as her therapist? I try to distance myself but a lot of the time she just makes any conversation about this. Once we got in a fight and I tried to bring up how I don’t want to know about their issues, and she compared it to me having fights with my own boyfriend. I feel that going to your mother with relationship problems (and I never talk about sex or anything like that) is a totally different dynamic than what she is doing to me. \\nAm I in the wrong for not wanting to hear these issues from my mother?',\n",

Once we got in a fight and I tried to bring up how I don’t want to know about their issues, and she compared it to me having fights with my own boyfriend. I feel that going to your mother with relationship problems (and I never talk about sex or anything like that) is a totally different dynamic than what she is doing to me. \\nAm I in the wrong for not wanting to hear these issues from my mother?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

Our mother passed away almost a decade ago and my dad has raised us since then. Ever since she was in middle school, my sister has had a lot of problems on the internet via sexting adult strangers and getting into trouble at school. We tried to help her but she was intent on doing that stuff secretly and we'd occasionally catch her or get notified by the school. She's now 18 and last year she ran away to live with her 16 year old boyfriend, and ever since she's just been nasty to me and my dad, ie. telling us to leave her alone and then sending pics of her tattoo to my dad just to make him upset.\\n\\nParticularly she's had a strong type of hatred towards me. She keeps saying the worst kind of people always smile and laugh and no one ever seems to dislike them. Nevermind that our mother was just that, there weren't a lot of people that didn't like her because she was truly a nice person. And she keeps telling me that I'm not perfect. Obviously, I'm not, kind of a no brainer there. I may not have done what she's done in life, but I've screwed up enough in my own ways. And I openly admit to it. She gets mad that I get to go to college when she'll be lucky to graduate high school, though no one ever was stopping her and I believe if she really tried, she could do all that and even more. But she seems to resent me for at least trying not to be a complete jerkwad.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, I love her to bits. I always have, and I always will. She's my little sister, and no matter what she does I'd do anything for her. But I just don't know what to do right now. She even messaged me on my birthday asking about money, arranged a meet-up only to never show up (that one really hurt). I just wonder if there's anything I can do at this point. Thanks for listening, and I hope y'all have a good day.\",\n",

       "    'selftext': 'My grandpa recently got a bug up his butt about the fact that I call my grandma \"Gran\".\\n\\nBack story: I am 26, recently moved home to try to save money for a house of my own. My mom lives in a second house on my grandparents\\' property, and has since she had me (single mom). We all split the utilities, and my mom and I do a lot of the yard work and maintenance for both houses, we shuttle my grandma to appointments and my mom looks after them when they\\'re sick or injured, but not serious enough to need medical attention. She does things like help my grandpa with his toenails, and checks in on them, runs errands for them, etc etc.\\n\\nI have called my grandma \"gran\" for probably 10-15 years, it\\'s going to be a very hard habit to break at this point. I don\\'t know why he\\'s just now decided he doesn\\'t like it. I tried to comply at first, to avoid drama, but damn if it isn\\'t hard to call someone something new after so many years. It\\'s making me extremely stressed. Family dinner is a nightmare, I just don\\'t talk to anyone.\\n\\nToday I was chatting with her and said something like \"thanks gran!\" and leaned down to kiss her cheek before I left, and he was like \"THANKS /WHO/???\" I just walked out without answering. I don\\'t know what brought this on, and I\\'m stressed about confronting him, because technically our house is his house so he could kick me and my mom out if he got mad enough. My current strategy is just avoiding interaction with him, which also sucks-- because prior to all this nonsense, we got along great.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: I did talk to my grandma about it, and she said it doesn\\'t bother her that I call her gran. She\\'s very non confrontational, but also extremely honest. I know that if she\\'d told him that she didn\\'t care for the nickname, she would have told me as much. She, for better or worse, won\\'t confront him about it. But said that I could call her gran if I wanted to and that he didn\\'t have a right to tell me, what I should call *her.*',\n",

       "    'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My grandpa recently got a bug up his butt about the fact that I call my grandma &amp;quot;Gran&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Back story: I am 26, recently moved home to try to save money for a house of my own. My mom lives in a second house on my grandparents&amp;#39; property, and has since she had me (single mom). We all split the utilities, and my mom and I do a lot of the yard work and maintenance for both houses, we shuttle my grandma to appointments and my mom looks after them when they&amp;#39;re sick or injured, but not serious enough to need medical attention. She does things like help my grandpa with his toenails, and checks in on them, runs errands for them, etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I have called my grandma &amp;quot;gran&amp;quot; for probably 10-15 years, it&amp;#39;s going to be a very hard habit to break at this point. I don&amp;#39;t know why he&amp;#39;s just now decided he doesn&amp;#39;t like it. I tried to comply at first, to avoid drama, but damn if it isn&amp;#39;t hard to call someone something new after so many years. It&amp;#39;s making me extremely stressed. Family dinner is a nightmare, I just don&amp;#39;t talk to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Today I was chatting with her and said something like &amp;quot;thanks gran!&amp;quot; and leaned down to kiss her cheek before I left, and he was like &amp;quot;THANKS /WHO/???&amp;quot; I just walked out without answering. I don&amp;#39;t know what brought this on, and I&amp;#39;m stressed about confronting him, because technically our house is his house so he could kick me and my mom out if he got mad enough. My current strategy is just avoiding interaction with him, which also sucks-- because prior to all this nonsense, we got along great.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I did talk to my grandma about it, and she said it doesn&amp;#39;t bother her that I call her gran. She&amp;#39;s very non confrontational, but also extremely honest. I know that if she&amp;#39;d told him that she didn&amp;#39;t care for the nickname, she would have told me as much. She, for better or worse, won&amp;#39;t confront him about it. But said that I could call her gran if I wanted to and that he didn&amp;#39;t have a right to tell me, what I should call &lt;em&gt;her.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Hi, first post and new here. Apologies if this is too long but I need to get this off my chest.\\n\\nI\\'ve never got along with my sister, (I\\'m 24 she\\'s 32) she always treated me like I was a hassle and never had a nice thing to say about me. I feel so isolated because the stories she tells people make me not want to show my face, people know her more so of course they\\'ll believe her over me, she even spread crap to my (already unbearable) Jobcentre work coach.\\n\\nNOTE: I\\'m struggling to move out because no landlord will have a UC claimant and the DWP are taking 1/3 of my living allowance. I am in touch with housing charities and I am trying to get help. I cant work due to extreme anxiety to the point of frequent dizzy spells, severe migraines, nausea and sometimes even passing out completely.\\n\\n9 months ago I had to leave my flat (for reasons that made me suicidal, not the first time I\\'ve been that way) and had to move in with her and her family. I had a long phase where every waking moment was so painful i struggled to breathe. I told her a few thoughts and she responded with \"I always knew you weren\\'t strong enough\". I few days later I overdosed my medication, she found me and had me rushed to A&amp;E, I was in overnight having blood tests and my heart monitored (no lasting effects) the next day she visited and complained how my attempt stopped her from making some kid\\'s birthday cake she promised she\\'d do. I felt safe at the hospital, the NHS staff were so lovely, when I got back I slowly started to improve (thanks to my wonderful nieces who took it upon themselves to mend my broken heart) and I was determined to help where I could.\\n\\nI cared for ALL the animals, and the kids. I\\'d happily cook for everyone too, I was happy for a while, but my sister started to get more and more upset with me because of how I cared for her children: mending soft toys, clipping and cleaning scraggly nails, nit treatment and combing, teeth brushing routines and regularly cleaned clothes and bedding (I worship those kids).

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, first post and new here. Apologies if this is too long but I need to get this off my chest.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never got along with my sister, (I&amp;#39;m 24 she&amp;#39;s 32) she always treated me like I was a hassle and never had a nice thing to say about me. I feel so isolated because the stories she tells people make me not want to show my face, people know her more so of course they&amp;#39;ll believe her over me, she even spread crap to my (already unbearable) Jobcentre work coach.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;NOTE: I&amp;#39;m struggling to move out because no landlord will have a UC claimant and the DWP are taking 1/3 of my living allowance. I am in touch with housing charities and I am trying to get help. I cant work due to extreme anxiety to the point of frequent dizzy spells, severe migraines, nausea and sometimes even passing out completely.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;9 months ago I had to leave my flat (for reasons that made me suicidal, not the first time I&amp;#39;ve been that way) and had to move in with her and her family. I had a long phase where every waking moment was so painful i struggled to breathe. I told her a few thoughts and she responded with &amp;quot;I always knew you weren&amp;#39;t strong enough&amp;quot;. I few days later I overdosed my medication, she found me and had me rushed to A&amp;amp;E, I was in overnight having blood tests and my heart monitored (no lasting effects) the next day she visited and complained how my attempt stopped her from making some kid&amp;#39;s birthday cake she promised she&amp;#39;d do. I felt safe at the hospital, the NHS staff were so lovely, when I got back I slowly started to improve (thanks to my wonderful nieces who took it upon themselves to mend my broken heart) and I was determined to help where I could.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I cared for ALL the animals, and the kids. I&amp;#39;d happily cook for everyone too, I was happy for a while, but my sister started to get more and more upset with me because of how I cared for her children: mending soft toys, clipping and cleaning scraggly nails, nit treatment and combing, teeth brushing routines and regularly cleaned clothes and bedding (I worship those kids). She tells them she&amp;#39;ll help them but shouts if they ask, if I do something for them she says in their faces &amp;quot;Am I not capable? Ey?&amp;quot; and storms off. She bit my head off for getting them fed, cleaned and ready for bed while she slept (from 3:45pm - 9pm, past kids bedtime).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Next morning she sat next to me on the sofa, looked me in the face with an expression that could kill and says &amp;quot;You make me feel like such a lousy mother&amp;quot; and again, storms off.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My sister lives in a pigsty and expects me to clean up after her, she tells me &amp;quot;compromise goes both ways&amp;quot; and I&amp;#39;m being lazy, antisocial and a general leech, I do nothing to help myself (apparently).

She doesn't care that my sister Katie and I were molested by my cousin Nick as a child and that I was treated like shit by my other cousin Ana (his sister) throughout my childhood and caught up in a hurtful, dysfunctional relationship with her as an adult (which ended with y cutting contact completely). My mom is more concerned with keeping “the family together” than acknowledging the damage that was done to me as a child and how it has affected me and continues to affect me as an adult. She is afraid. She is a coward. She is afraid of looking bad. She is afraid of any confrontation even if the outcome would be good for her kids. She makes up stories in her head and believes them and is afraid and paranoid. She was not an active mother to me as a child. But I did love her. She had a very happy and warm energy, and still does.  She was loving and comforting when it was convenient to her. She treated me like an inconvenience. I hated being alive.

       "   'selftext': 'Growing up was hard. My twin sister and I lived with our mum. We lived in over 25 houses in the first 16 years of our lives. One particular year, we moved 4 times. The time came when we knew we would be moving again soon. The knocks on the front door would become more frequent. The hiding in our rooms or under our beds would become more frequent. The inability to answer the house phone would become more frequent. The isolation from mum\\'s \"new close friends\" would begin.\\n\\nWe would start packing up our belongings and saw it is as a competition to see how quickly we could complete this. We became experts, eventually being able to pack and unpack a house in a day. We would put the radio on and sing and dance to music as a way to distract ourselves while packing. It stopped us from dwelling on the fact that we were moving again. It stopped us from thinking about \\'why\\': mum had once again failed to pay the rent and the bills. She owed people money (her new friends, the landlords, her colleagues, her clients, or even our elderly neighbours).\\n\\nHer lies had caught up with her again and she could no longer hide behind them. She had exhausted all her favours. She had exhausted the people\\'s goodwill and they were starting to see the truth. That she had lied and manipulated them. That she had used her children and the fact that she was a single parent as a reason for them to feel sorry for her and to give her the benefit of the doubt. To let her have longer to pay them. To trust or have faith that she would come up with the money. Eventually they all came to the same conclusions. They realised that they needed to cut their losses and find a more reliable tenant. That her promises were empty. That they couldn\\'t help us even if they had tried.\\n\\nThis process continued. Over and over. Mum worked as a carer with elderly first and then the disabled. She worked as a cleaner sometimes too. She had an infectious and bubbly personality. She could make fast friends so easily. Internally and behind closed doors, I look back and can see a lady who was deeply depressed. She would often spend days in bed. She had high levels of anxiety from all the lies she was living with. She was constantly trying to function at a heightened level to keep ahead of her lies. It got to a point where I\\'m not even sure she knew the difference between the lie she had created and the truth. She was a master manipulator. This was one of her biggest assets in a way, as it allowed her to continue to exploit people to feed her problem. She did this for so many years and never truly suffered the consequences of her actions.\\n\\nWe knew mum had a problem from the age of 7. We heard whispers from our family friends. That she was addicted to gambling. The pokies specifically. My sister and I were left to our own devices from that age. We would often be at home alone. Wondering what to eat. How to get it ready. When to go to school. If she would be home to take us or if we needed to find our own way there. If she would be there to pick us up or if we needed to find our way home. This became our life.\\n\\nWe were independent from a young age, not able to rely on mum to organise things for us. We worried about her of course, as any child would. When she was gone for long periods, we thought the worst.\\n\\nHad something happened to her?\\n\\nHad she crashed her car?\\n\\nHad she been arrested?\\n\\nShe always had excuses about where she was. She had been at work. She had to stay later and longer. She was working hard to earn money to pay rent. Her car had broken down. She was helping a friend. She took someone to the hospital. The list continued.\\n\\nIn the end, we would hop on our bikes and ride from pub to pub. If we found mum\\'s car at least we would know where she was and not have to worry. We would walk the streets late at night. We would climb on the roof and look into the distance, hoping to see her coming home. We didn\\'t advertise to anyone what our home life was like. Our diet included two-minute noodles, macaroni and cheese, toast, and milo.\\n\\nSometimes on pay day, mum would do a shop and we would have food for awhile. Then it would slowly dwindle and we would go back to the basics. This has definitely impacted my diet to this day. Food has always been the lowest priority. We were used to going without.\\n\\nMum was on the wrong side of the law a few times over different periods growing up. From when we were 8, mum had some friends who could make money growing cannabis in their sheds and cupboards. The allure of money won mum over. Even though we were renting, her and her friends set up shop in the garden shed. They converted it into a hydroponic set up with the fluorescent lights and black lining over the walls. We didn\\'t think too much of it. We knew it was illegal but after the first few crops and an influx of money, mum seemed happier. We had more food than we\\'d had in awhile. We didn\\'t move house when the month came to the end so it seemed like there were more positives at the time.\\n\\nThe problem with this was that mum still had her underlying addiction. Often, she would receive the influx of cash and spend bigger at the pokies for longer. In the end, it only fuelled her problem to some degree. We continued to move house. The garden sheds got a little bigger and the crops got a little larger. We came home one day to find the crops were ready to dry out. The whole house smelt. Mum was sitting on the floor in the rumpus room with newspaper and scissors. She was cutting the cannabis. We sat down and helped her. I think we were 8.\\n\\nReflecting back on this with my sister, we laughed. We laughed at many things. We laughed at how we used to make a game of remembering the names of the streets we\\'d lived in and what order they were in from when we were born until now. We laughed at cutting cannabis with mum when we were 8. We laughed at the police and debt collectors who knocked on our doors repetitively over the years. We laughed at how mum had told them she was our aunty a couple of times and got away with it. We laughed at how mum used to change her last name. For bills, for jobs, for house applications. We couldn\\'t keep up.\\n\\nWas it Harvey or Watts or Nitsche?\\n\\nWe weren\\'t sure. It allowed her to get away with things for longer.\\n\\nLaughing, it seems, is one of our many coping mechanisms. In a way, we have compartmentalised this part of our life and locked it away. By not talking about it, we haven\\'t really dealt with our feelings and we were both afraid of the impact of this on us now and later. This is why we have decided to share our stories.\\n\\nMum was the ultimate fraudster. She was given charge of our local soccer club finances one year. I think they figured she used to work in a bank so she was good with sums. They weren\\'t to know she had an addiction and shouldn\\'t be trusted. Mum used her knowledge of banks to then spend all of our soccer club\\'s money. She got passed the need for two signatures and withdrew that money. I will never know how she got away with that and how no one pressed charges. The club folded soon after.\\n\\nAnother brush with the law came when mum was housesitting a work colleague\\'s house. Unbeknownst to us, while her work colleague was overseas, she began pawning off her belongings. Jewellery, sporting equipment, electronics and the list goes on. This showed a desperate but opportunistic woman. Of course, her friend returned from overseas. She quickly realised her stuff was gone. She went to the police and this was mum\\'s most serious encounter with the law. I remember she had to get lawyers. She went to court. The investigation and process dragged on for months. Mum was stressed and depressed. She asked our grandma to help her. Grandma gave her money. She paid for the lawyers. She bailed her out of another problem. She didn’t want us to be without mum. She didn’t want mum to have a criminal record. If only grandma could understand that she wasn\\'t doing her any favours. Mum continued to gamble. She continued to lie. She continued to owe people money. I sometimes wish Grandma had let mum suffer the consequences of her actions back then. Maybe she could have been helped. We will never know.\\n\\nIn our minds, as my sister and I became more aware of what was going on, we decided we just needed to get through school. We wanted to be better. We wanted to do better. We needed to get away from this life we were living. We had aspirations and somehow, despite our role models, we knew right from wrong. We despised lies. We despised debt. We tolerated our mum but we didn\\'t like what she had become or how she treated people. It got to the point where we didn\\'t believe a single word out of her mouth. Everything seemed to be a lie. Even if she was just talking about her day, about a conversation she had with someone. Nothing could be taken as the truth anymore.\\n\\nMy sister and I threw ourselves into our schooling and our sport. Those were our outlets. Those got us through. The times continued to be tough. We held on to the thought that if we aimed high, we could eventually walk away from all this. We had each other. We inspired each other and we always felt so lucky to be twins. It was a blessing that there were two of us to support each other whilst we struggled through this life together.\\n\\nMum started to unravel at times when her guilt and desperation reached heightened levels. She would take her stress and anger out on us. She manipulated us into feeling like a burden. Like all her money problems were because of us. She would be irrational. She would search our rooms for money. We would have to hide. We were scared when she was in these states. We would sometimes roam the streets until she calmed down.\\n\\nWe kept our lives a secret. No one knew. Not our teachers. Not our friends. We were embarrassed and in a way, we felt guilty. We had lied. We had lied to many people. It had become second nature. We put up a facade in order to get the next house.\\n\\nIn order to keep mum out of trouble.\\n\\nWe didn\\'t want her to go to jail and where would we live?\\n\\nWe weren\\'t innocent.\\n\\nWe contributed to people being hurt.\\n\\nTo people being deceived and manipulated.\\n\\nIt was wrong but we felt trapped.\\n\\nWhere else could we have gone?\\n\\nI don\\'t regret many things in life but I do regret this. We were selfish. We were in self-preservation mode. We went along with the lies, which was wrong. Many people were affected by our mum\\'s actions. Too many to name. They lost money. They had their trust broken. They even lost belongings that she sold or pawned. Some people were so vulnerable that they had no chance to even say no. The elderly, the disabled, and even her own family.\\n\\nThe last straw came many years later. Our grandma was progressing with her dementia. As the grandchildren, we didn\\'t want to get too involved with grandma\\'s finances. It\\'s usually the parents who take care of these matters when they arise. Our grandma had one daughter and one son. Her son, on our recommendation, had placed grandma\\'s money in a fixed term deposit account, not attached to her normal bank account. We had thought this would be enough to stop mum from accessing the bulk of grandma\\'s money. But we were wrong.\\n\\nMum had gotten around that and taken grandma into the bank. She got her to sign a form to put the money in her normal account and had been withdrawing that money slowly but surely over a few months. Our uncle found this out when he came over from Tasmania for a holiday. He exposed the ugly truth. That mum could sink so low that she would exploit her own family. Her mother who had helped her time and time again over the years. Her mother who had dementia and was so trusting of her. She prayed on the most vulnerable. Grandma had always believed that mum could get better. That she deserved second chances.\\n\\nWe were all angry. At mum and at ourselves. We should have known mum wouldn\\'t stop. That no one was off limits to her addiction and her lies. Since that day, we haven\\'t seen or spoken to mum.\\n\\nMy sister and I took over caring for our grandma. We love her dearly. She is now in a nursing home. Mum doesn\\'t know where she is. She has never visited her. Grandma asks about her most days. She knows what she did and it hurts her to think of what her daughter has become. For me, I feel better not having mum in my life. It\\'s definitely easier. I don\\'t have to worry what is coming next. I don\\'t have to worry about answering my phone. I don\\'t have to worry about debt collectors or friends chasing money from her.\\n\\nThe sad thing is that we don\\'t know where mum is. We wouldn\\'t know if she is dead or alive and that haunts me in my dreams.',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up was hard. My twin sister and I lived with our mum. We lived in over 25 houses in the first 16 years of our lives. One particular year, we moved 4 times. The time came when we knew we would be moving again soon. The knocks on the front door would become more frequent. The hiding in our rooms or under our beds would become more frequent. The inability to answer the house phone would become more frequent. The isolation from mum&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;new close friends&amp;quot; would begin.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We would start packing up our belongings and saw it is as a competition to see how quickly we could complete this. We became experts, eventually being able to pack and unpack a house in a day. We would put the radio on and sing and dance to music as a way to distract ourselves while packing. It stopped us from dwelling on the fact that we were moving again. It stopped us from thinking about &amp;#39;why&amp;#39;: mum had once again failed to pay the rent and the bills. She owed people money (her new friends, the landlords, her colleagues, her clients, or even our elderly neighbours).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Her lies had caught up with her again and she could no longer hide behind them. She had exhausted all her favours. She had exhausted the people&amp;#39;s goodwill and they were starting to see the truth. That she had lied and manipulated them. That she had used her children and the fact that she was a single parent as a reason for them to feel sorry for her and to give her the benefit of the doubt. To let her have longer to pay them. To trust or have faith that she would come up with the money. Eventually they all came to the same conclusions. They realised that they needed to cut their losses and find a more reliable tenant. That her promises were empty. That they couldn&amp;#39;t help us even if they had tried.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This process continued. Over and over. Mum worked as a carer with elderly first and then the disabled. She worked as a cleaner sometimes too. She had an infectious and bubbly personality. She could make fast friends so easily. Internally and behind closed doors, I look back and can see a lady who was deeply depressed. She would often spend days in bed. She had high levels of anxiety from all the lies she was living with. She was constantly trying to function at a heightened level to keep ahead of her lies. It got to a point where I&amp;#39;m not even sure she knew the difference between the lie she had created and the truth. She was a master manipulator. This was one of her biggest assets in a way, as it allowed her to continue to exploit people to feed her problem. She did this for so many years and never truly suffered the consequences of her actions.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We knew mum had a problem from the age of 7. We heard whispers from our family friends. That she was addicted to gambling. The pokies specifically. My sister and I were left to our own devices from that age. We would often be at home alone. Wondering what to eat. How to get it ready. When to go to school. If she would be home to take us or if we needed to find our own way there. If she would be there to pick us up or if we needed to find our way home. This became our life.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We were independent from a young age, not able to rely on mum to organise things for us. We worried about her of course, as any child would. When she was gone for long periods, we thought the worst.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Had something happened to her?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Had she crashed her car?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Had she been arrested?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She always had excuses about where she was. She had been at work. She had to stay later and longer. She was working hard to earn money to pay rent. Her car had broken down. She was helping a friend. She took someone to the hospital. The list continued.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In the end, we would hop on our bikes and ride from pub to pub. If we found mum&amp;#39;s car at least we would know where she was and not have to worry. We would walk the streets late at night. We would climb on the roof and look into the distance, hoping to see her coming home. We didn&amp;#39;t advertise to anyone what our home life was like. Our diet included two-minute noodles, macaroni and cheese, toast, and milo.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes on pay day, mum would do a shop and we would have food for awhile. Then it would slowly dwindle and we would go back to the basics. This has definitely impacted my diet to this day. Food has always been the lowest priority. We were used to going without.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mum was on the wrong side of the law a few times over different periods growing up. From when we were 8, mum had some friends who could make money growing cannabis in their sheds and cupboards. The allure of money won mum over. Even though we were renting, her and her friends set up shop in the garden shed. They converted it into a hydroponic set up with the fluorescent lights and black lining over the walls. We didn&amp;#39;t think too much of it. We knew it was illegal but after the first few crops and an influx of money, mum seemed happier. We had more food than we&amp;#39;d had in awhile. We didn&amp;#39;t move house when the month came to the end so it seemed like there were more positives at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The problem with this was that mum still had her underlying addiction. Often, she would receive the influx of cash and spend bigger at the pokies for longer. In the end, it only fuelled her problem to some degree. We continued to move house. The garden sheds got a little bigger and the crops got a little larger. We came home one day to find the crops were ready to dry out. The whole house smelt. Mum was sitting on the floor in the rumpus room with newspaper and scissors. She was cutting the cannabis. We sat down and helped her. I think we were 8.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Reflecting back on this with my sister, we laughed. We laughed at many things. We laughed at how we used to make a game of remembering the names of the streets we&amp;#39;d lived in and what order they were in from when we were born until now. We laughed at cutting cannabis with mum when we were 8. We laughed at the police and debt collectors who knocked on our doors repetitively over the years.

       "   'selftext': 'Long post. Tldr at the bottom.\\n\\nWithin the past year, I (21 f) have been slowly realizing that I don\\'t think I have a good relationship with my mom.\\n\\nFor a while, I\\'ve just felt like I need to grow up or that we just have really different personalities and it\\'s my fault I dont like to be around her. I was really excited to go to college so I didnt have to interact with her as often and, again, thought I might have just been overreacting or hormonal. I\\'ve always made excuses to not visit her since then. I usually dont text her first and when I do it\\'s because I feel guilty for not having interacted with her for a few days, not because I really want to. Sometimes when she texts me I dont even respond for a whole day. I can\\'t quite put my finger on why I feel like this but I recently realized something that might help me put the puzzle together.\\n\\nFor years my mom and my dads mom have had beef. I\\'m pretty sure this was an ordeal even before I was born. I didn\\'t really realize it was happening until I was about 15. My mom started talking mad shit about her around that time but it was never really specific. I have personally witnessed my dads mom say some shady things and so having only my own mothers side of the story I naturally sided with her. \\n\\nMy mom and dad did not have a happy marriage for very long. I remember from a very young age that they had some issues. But that\\'s a whole \\'nother can of worms to step in. I was in my mid teens when my mom started to \"open up\"  about her and my dads relationship. My dad never really talked to me (I daresay he was emotionally neglectful but again that\\'s even another can of worms) so I never really got his side of the story. My mom just said some absolutely terrible things about my dad then when she was done ranting she would say something nice about him. Hindsight it just seems like she was afraid I would say something to him so she was just trying to cover her steps but idk. The point is she got me to take her side.\\n\\nThey finally got divorced last year and my dad has been very honest with me about the whole thing. He is telling me what my mom did wrong just like my mom always (always...) tells me what he did wrong. But what he does that\\'s different than my mom is understand his own role in the failed marriage. He knows exactly where he went wrong and he is really trying to change for the better. And him opening up to me like that made me realize just how much my mom lied to me and manipulated me to hate my dad. \\n\\nThroughout my childhood she always threw shade at my friends and their families which has ultimately ruined multiple friendships, so like... more than one. Like I\\'m just realizing this as I\\'m writing this but she rarely had anything good to say about any of my friends and their families. I feel like a total asshole having taken her side so often. Again, I thought I had done something wrong but...\\n\\nI\\'m finally a semi functional person with somewhat coherent thoughts and I guess I\\'m just starting to notice a pattern. I keep my distance from my mom because she makes me uncomfortable. My mom has always thrown mad shade at my dad and his mom. My dad opening up to me realized that my mom was telling me lies about him and it just makes me wonder what she was lying about my grandmother (dads mom) and my friends. Or what kinds of lies shes saying about me to her friends. She always made me believe she had a good relationship with me but I\\'m certainly questioning that now.\\n\\nIdk, maybe I\\'m overthinking this or reading this situation wrong but it feels good to get this off my chest at least. \\n\\nTldr: my mom has said some really terrible things about a lot of the people in my life and I have always taken her side and I\\'m just now realizing why I don\\'t like being around her.',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long post. Tldr at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Within the past year, I (21 f) have been slowly realizing that I don&amp;#39;t think I have a good relationship with my mom.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For a while, I&amp;#39;ve just felt like I need to grow up or that we just have really different personalities and it&amp;#39;s my fault I dont like to be around her. I was really excited to go to college so I didnt have to interact with her as often and, again, thought I might have just been overreacting or hormonal. I&amp;#39;ve always made excuses to not visit her since then. I usually dont text her first and when I do it&amp;#39;s because I feel guilty for not having interacted with her for a few days, not because I really want to. Sometimes when she texts me I dont even respond for a whole day. I can&amp;#39;t quite put my finger on why I feel like this but I recently realized something that might help me put the puzzle together.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For years my mom and my dads mom have had beef. I&amp;#39;m pretty sure this was an ordeal even before I was born. I didn&amp;#39;t really realize it was happening until I was about 15. My mom started talking mad shit about her around that time but it was never really specific. I have personally witnessed my dads mom say some shady things and so having only my own mothers side of the story I naturally sided with her. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My mom and dad did not have a happy marriage for very long. I remember from a very young age that they had some issues. But that&amp;#39;s a whole &amp;#39;nother can of worms to step in. I was in my mid teens when my mom started to &amp;quot;open up&amp;quot;  about her and my dads relationship. My dad never really talked to me (I daresay he was emotionally neglectful but again that&amp;#39;s even another can of worms) so I never really got his side of the story. My mom just said some absolutely terrible things about my dad then when she was done ranting she would say something nice about him. Hindsight it just seems like she was afraid I would say something to him so she was just trying to cover her steps but idk. The point is she got me to take her side.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They finally got divorced last year and my dad has been very honest with me about the whole thing. He is telling me what my mom did wrong just like my mom always (always...) tells me what he did wrong. But what he does that&amp;#39;s different than my mom is understand his own role in the failed marriage. He knows exactly where he went wrong and he is really trying to change for the better. And him opening up to me like that made me realize just how much my mom lied to me and manipulated me to hate my dad. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Throughout my childhood she always threw shade at my friends and their families which has ultimately ruined multiple friendships, so like... more than one. Like I&amp;#39;m just realizing this as I&amp;#39;m writing this but she rarely had anything good to say about any of my friends and their families. I feel like a total asshole having taken her side so often. Again, I thought I had done something wrong but...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m finally a semi functional person with somewhat coherent thoughts and I guess I&amp;#39;m just starting to notice a pattern. I keep my distance from my mom because she makes me uncomfortable. My mom has always thrown mad shade at my dad and his mom. My dad opening up to me realized that my mom was telling me lies about him and it just makes me wonder what she was lying about my grandmother (dads mom) and my friends. Or what kinds of lies shes saying about me to her friends. She always made me believe she had a good relationship with me but I&amp;#39;m certainly questioning that now.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Idk, maybe I&amp;#39;m overthinking this or reading this situation wrong but it feels good to get this off my chest at least. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Tldr: my mom has said some really terrible things about a lot of the people in my life and I have always taken her side and I&amp;#39;m just now realizing why I don&amp;#39;t like being around her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'We just had our first child three weeks ago. She is the first grandchild on both sides. My mom has made it clear she would like to see her grandchild 3-4x a week even though she will be watching her full time when I go back to work at 4 months (starting to question her watching her now...).\\n\\nMy family calls and texts constantly. My mom wants to FaceTime during diaper changes and feedings (I breastfeed) and will call and text constantly until I answer if I don’t pick up right away. Really hard with a newborn to constantly be texting...\\n\\nLast week kind of set me over the top. My family knows I have been extremely worried about germs with a newborn. My sister and mom came over last Wednesday. When my sister got here, her nose was runny and her voice was basically gone. I asked about 10 times if she was sick and she assured me she had bad allergies. The next day she threw up at 9 AM. No one decided to tell me this. My family still was planning to get together Friday.. they only canceled after she was still throwing up early Friday morning.. meaning they were going to get together knowing my sister was sick until she spent 2 days puking. \\n\\nI told my parents that since they have spent a lot of time with my sister and have been exposed I’d like to wait a week or so before getting together. My mom calls constantly crying, and begging to come see our baby. She said she’d wear a mask and gloves.. I am constantly trying to nicely tell her I’m just concerned exposing our new baby to germs. After finally getting my mother to agree that she could wait a week to see the baby- she tells me she’s also had diarrhea but it was likely something she ate. Clearly my family has been sick and they are writing it off because they want to see the baby. They have been extremely overbearing and stressing me out. \\n\\nAny advice? I don’t know how to handle this.',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We just had our first child three weeks ago. She is the first grandchild on both sides. My mom has made it clear she would like to see her grandchild 3-4x a week even though she will be watching her full time when I go back to work at 4 months (starting to question her watching her now...).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My family calls and texts constantly. My mom wants to FaceTime during diaper changes and feedings (I breastfeed) and will call and text constantly until I answer if I don’t pick up right away. Really hard with a newborn to constantly be texting...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Last week kind of set me over the top. My family knows I have been extremely worried about germs with a newborn. My sister and mom came over last Wednesday. When my sister got here, her nose was runny and her voice was basically gone. I asked about 10 times if she was sick and she assured me she had bad allergies. The next day she threw up at 9 AM. No one decided to tell me this. My family still was planning to get together Friday.. they only canceled after she was still throwing up early Friday morning.. meaning they were going to get together knowing my sister was sick until she spent 2 days puking. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I told my parents that since they have spent a lot of time with my sister and have been exposed I’d like to wait a week or so before getting together. My mom calls constantly crying, and begging to come see our baby. She said she’d wear a mask and gloves.. I am constantly trying to nicely tell her I’m just concerned exposing our new baby to germs. After finally getting my mother to agree that she could wait a week to see the baby- she tells me she’s also had diarrhea but it was likely something she ate. Clearly my family has been sick and they are writing it off because they want to see the baby. They have been extremely overbearing and stressing me out. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Any advice? I don’t know how to handle this.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

There's quite a bit to it in terms of my relationship with my dad..\\n\\nI come from an Asian family and for some reason this sometimes means we just never communicate about our emotions. My dad unfortunately lost his job due to a fire and he's been doing manual labour type jobs his whole life. He loves it but obviously it has taken a huge toll on his physical health. He's generally ok but has a lot of pain in his legs and back because of his jobs but also because of various health issues. This is important to mention because he just refuses to do anything active like going for a run or a walk if the weather is nice just to kill time.\\n\\nI feel bad for him that he's now been sitting at home for a couple of weeks seeming really bored. I would like to add he IS actively looking for jobs but not getting  anywhere because of his lack of qualifications. He occasionally goes out with his friends but obviously they all work so that's hard to do. I don't want to continue to watch him like this but equally I don't know how to talk to him about it in fear he'll think I'm just taking pity on him (this is where the whole Asian family type stuff comes in).\\n\\nWhat do you guys think I could do with my Dad to help him actually live life a little? I'm a 22 yr old female btw, currently have all the time in the world as I just graduated and don't start my Master's programme until September, so I have time to help him out.\\n\\nI hope you guys can help, thank you so much if you've read this.\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I\\'m hesitant to post this as I\\'ve never posted in an open forum before, but I\\'m really hoping someone might be able to give me some helpful advice on this. My older brother is 37 years old, and has been dealing with depression since his very early teens. He has been on medication this entire time, different ones prescribed by different doctors. He sees a therapist regularly. He meditates daily. Some days he\\'s okay, and can laugh every now and then. But most of time he just seems miserable and emotionless.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTo give a better perspective on our family dynamic, here\\'s an overly long paragraph about us:\\n\\nMy parents separated when I was 6 (brother was 9). It wasn\\'t a super messy split, but my dad refused to pay child support for quite a long time, and my mom ended up having to use all of her savings on court/lawyers fees to try and get him to pay. We lived with my mom (she struggled to get by for years), and saw my dad every other weekend. My dad\\'s entire life has always revolved around soccer. He lives and breathes it. Most of my childhood was spent at the soccer field: my mom played it, I played it, my brother played it for a couple years, and my dad coached women\\'s soccer teams, took teams to tournaments and ran the leagues in our city. To this day, a conversation with my dad would include a lengthy chat about soccer. I know he definitely chose soccer over visiting with us numerous times.\\n\\nIn all honesty, I don\\'t really remember my childhood being that bad, I still felt loved by both my parents. But my brother seems to think differently. He has a very heavy dislike (hatred?) towards my dad. And my mom too, but mostly my dad.\\n\\nGrowing up, my brother always did really well in school. He\\'s the smart one in the family, and has always has good jobs. He\\'s had to loan my mom money several times in his life. I think he resents her for not being able to take care of us \"properly\".\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOur family has also never been one to go out of our way to communicate with each other. We don\\'t have any deep conversations about feelings, and we never have. My mom and I are very close, and I\\'m also quite close to my dad. My brother feels like an outcast. I recently found this out when him and I had a little drunk heart-to-heart outside of a wedding celebration. He thinks he\\'s not like us, and he feels like he doesn\\'t belong when our extended family gets together. (My mom lives in a separate building on the same property as my aunt/uncle, so by extended family I mean mom/brother/me/aunt/uncle/cousins).\\n\\nWhen we\\'re together, he\\'s usually pretty quiet, although if he\\'s in an okay mood he\\'s very funny and can laugh and be sarcastic with the rest of us. He really is a lot of fun when he\\'s at his best. It\\'s rare though.\\n\\nA lot of the time he\\'s sarcastic, I\\'d say almost to a hurtful extent. I\\'ve dealt with it my entire life, so I take people\\'s insults as jokes. I\\'ve always laughed off comments that my brother made to me, even if they were true. I think my dad did the same. My mom takes my brother\\'s comments to heart.\\n\\nI\\'ve been paying attention more recently to how he acts around me compared to how he acts around my parents. I moved in with him a few months ago (temporary job), and have noticed that for the most part, he can laugh and joke with me. I make stupid comments and he laughs, it\\'s quite fun. When we\\'re around our parents, he is very different. This is when he\\'ll be quiet, moody, barely smile. He\\'ll make little jabs at my mom (like I said, she takes them to heart, I can see the hurt in her eyes when he says them), and if he\\'s around my dad it\\'s so much worse. He endlessly (somewhat subtly) tells my dad that he\\'s a shitty person. He makes so many snide remarks towards him, being completely serious, but my dad tends to laugh them off (I guess I learned this from him).\\n\\nMy dad is a hoarder, by the way. Not like the garbage everywhere kind, but he keeps everything. He has rooms piled with things (a lot of soccer stuff), and he doesn\\'t clean the house or take care of himself. I know that he\\'s recently gone a month without showering. He\\'s also slowing down in his age (71), so I\\'m worried about him.\\n\\nI think the hoarding that my dad is doing has created an even bigger divide between my dad and brother. My dad makes no effort to call/text/keep in touch with my brother. My brother barely makes an attempt at talking to my dad. Every now and then my brother will call him when he\\'s waiting to board a plane (because he knows he\\'ll have to hang up in a certain amount of time).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'ve frequently googled how to help a depressed friend or family member, and all I get are the same results. \"Tell them you\\'re there to listen, encourage them to get help, tell them it gets better\". I\\'ve told him I\\'m here to listen, he doesn\\'t want to talk to me. He\\'s been seeing a therapist for many years now, and has taken countless medications. He\\'s been depressed since he was about 14, and it hasn\\'t gotten any better for him.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHe\\'s still alone. He\\'s had a girlfriend every now and then but nothing for more than a year or so. He\\'s never been married. I know he wants to get married, I know he\\'d even like to have a kid one day. I think this gets to him a lot that he\\'s still single.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt makes me so incredibly sad to see him like this, and I don\\'t know how to help him. He truly is a great guy, and he deserves to find happiness and enjoyment in his life.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAny advice to approach this would be greatly appreciated.',\n",

We don&amp;#39;t have any deep conversations about feelings, and we never have. My mom and I are very close, and I&amp;#39;m also quite close to my dad. My brother feels like an outcast. I recently found this out when him and I had a little drunk heart-to-heart outside of a wedding celebration. He thinks he&amp;#39;s not like us, and he feels like he doesn&amp;#39;t belong when our extended family gets together. (My mom lives in a separate building on the same property as my aunt/uncle, so by extended family I mean mom/brother/me/aunt/uncle/cousins).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When we&amp;#39;re together, he&amp;#39;s usually pretty quiet, although if he&amp;#39;s in an okay mood he&amp;#39;s very funny and can laugh and be sarcastic with the rest of us. He really is a lot of fun when he&amp;#39;s at his best. It&amp;#39;s rare though.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of the time he&amp;#39;s sarcastic, I&amp;#39;d say almost to a hurtful extent. I&amp;#39;ve dealt with it my entire life, so I take people&amp;#39;s insults as jokes. I&amp;#39;ve always laughed off comments that my brother made to me, even if they were true. I think my dad did the same. My mom takes my brother&amp;#39;s comments to heart.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been paying attention more recently to how he acts around me compared to how he acts around my parents. I moved in with him a few months ago (temporary job), and have noticed that for the most part, he can laugh and joke with me. I make stupid comments and he laughs, it&amp;#39;s quite fun. When we&amp;#39;re around our parents, he is very different. This is when he&amp;#39;ll be quiet, moody, barely smile. He&amp;#39;ll make little jabs at my mom (like I said, she takes them to heart, I can see the hurt in her eyes when he says them), and if he&amp;#39;s around my dad it&amp;#39;s so much worse. He endlessly (somewhat subtly) tells my dad that he&amp;#39;s a shitty person. He makes so many snide remarks towards him, being completely serious, but my dad tends to laugh them off (I guess I learned this from him).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My dad is a hoarder, by the way. Not like the garbage everywhere kind, but he keeps everything. He has rooms piled with things (a lot of soccer stuff), and he doesn&amp;#39;t clean the house or take care of himself. I know that he&amp;#39;s recently gone a month without showering. He&amp;#39;s also slowing down in his age (71), so I&amp;#39;m worried about him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I think the hoarding that my dad is doing has created an even bigger divide between my dad and brother. My dad makes no effort to call/text/keep in touch with my brother. My brother barely makes an attempt at talking to my dad. Every now and then my brother will call him when he&amp;#39;s waiting to board a plane (because he knows he&amp;#39;ll have to hang up in a certain amount of time).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve frequently googled how to help a depressed friend or family member, and all I get are the same results. &amp;quot;Tell them you&amp;#39;re there to listen, encourage them to get help, tell them it gets better&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;ve told him I&amp;#39;m here to listen, he doesn&amp;#39;t want to talk to me. He&amp;#39;s been seeing a therapist for many years now, and has taken countless medications. He&amp;#39;s been depressed since he was about 14, and it hasn&amp;#39;t gotten any better for him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s still alone. He&amp;#39;s had a girlfriend every now and then but nothing for more than a year or so. He&amp;#39;s never been married. I know he wants to get married, I know he&amp;#39;d even like to have a kid one day. I think this gets to him a lot that he&amp;#39;s still single.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It makes me so incredibly sad to see him like this, and I don&amp;#39;t know how to help him. He truly is a great guy, and he deserves to find happiness and enjoyment in his life.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Any advice to approach this would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

It’s always been borderline emotionally abusive, sometimes physical (my mom has thrown things at my dad and has hit him). \\nA couple years ago my dad almost died because of diabetes and is now disabled. As of now he’s prescribed oxy for the pain, and has been on it for 2 years. However, he is abusing it, and snorts it, passes out and drools on himself, etc. He has also started drinking again, at first it was just a couple glasses of wine, and now we have to hide any beer we have in the house. He’s an alcoholic, addicted to oxy, on the couch literally 24/7, and isn’t the nicest person. \\nMy mother isn’t the nicest either, I feel that she can be pretty selfish a lot of the time. For example, she hasn’t done her taxes in 2 years, gets mad when I ask her to, and I haven’t been able to apply for FAFSA. I’m always scared to say anything not positive about her behavior because she gets mad, yells at me, and insults me, usually calling me a drama queen and telling me to get over it. Because of my dad’s disability, bills are a little harder to pay because he’s not working anymore, and my mom isn’t working either. \\nI am currently going to school for social work, and a lot of the time my mom comes to me with her issues because I have the right responses. However, I don’t want to be her therapist. She will talk to me about very personal problems, sometimes even bringing up her and my father’s sex life. A few months ago she had a mental breakdown, and our house was almost in foreclosure. I was the only one in the family who knew about this besides my mom, my brother and sister had no idea. She comes to me with these issues of money, running through all of their savings, 401K, etc. She talks to me about leaving him, moving away, and needing to “put herself first for once.” She also complains about how my dad is basically just killing himself, as he also had collapsed lungs and is smoking cigarettes a lot. But my mom also smokes, and I brought up how she shouldn’t smoke either because if she ends up in the hospital like my father did, I’ll have to deal with it all, as my siblings will most definitely not be helpful. When I said this she just brushed it off and said something along the lines of “I know, your father is useless and won’t help”\\n\\nHow do I tell my mom that this is an inappropriate relationship and it makes me super uncomfortable to be expected to act as her therapist? I try to distance myself but a lot of the time she just makes any conversation about this. Once we got in a fight and I tried to bring up how I don’t want to know about their issues, and she compared it to me having fights with my own boyfriend. I feel that going to your mother with relationship problems (and I never talk about sex or anything like that) is a totally different dynamic than what she is doing to me. \\nAm I in the wrong for not wanting to hear these issues from my mother?',\n",

He wanted me to tell everyone who emailed him, that if he could, he would individually thank every one of you, but sadly the prison is limiting him on how many he can see at a time. He isn't sure he will be able to even see them all. He did say he was sorry to anyone who wrote that he isn't able to respond to, and it is the prison saying he cant, not him. We were not expecting this much of a response! Because of this, I am removing the email information. He also said anyone who would like to write snail mail and talk to him that way is still welcome to do so. The prison cant really limit that. I do want everyone who wrote him to know that all of you truly helped him (and my family) in a way we could never thank you for.  Tonight as we were getting off of the phone, he said hes actually been seeing the beauty in people again, instead of the ugly he has for so many years. This whole thing has completely restored both of our faiths in humanity and the goodness that is within strangers from all over the world.

       "   'selftext': \"Okay, some backstory. I'm a senior college student with and my little sister is a high school junior. Our mother passed away almost a decade ago and my dad has raised us since then. Ever since she was in middle school, my sister has had a lot of problems on the internet via sexting adult strangers and getting into trouble at school. We tried to help her but she was intent on doing that stuff secretly and we'd occasionally catch her or get notified by the school. She's now 18 and last year she ran away to live with her 16 year old boyfriend, and ever since she's just been nasty to me and my dad, ie. telling us to leave her alone and then sending pics of her tattoo to my dad just to make him upset.\\n\\nParticularly she's had a strong type of hatred towards me. She keeps saying the worst kind of people always smile and laugh and no one ever seems to dislike them. Nevermind that our mother was just that, there weren't a lot of people that didn't like her because she was truly a nice person. And she keeps telling me that I'm not perfect. Obviously, I'm not, kind of a no brainer there. I may not have done what she's done in life, but I've screwed up enough in my own ways. And I openly admit to it. She gets mad that I get to go to college when she'll be lucky to graduate high school, though no one ever was stopping her and I believe if she really tried, she could do all that and even more. But she seems to resent me for at least trying not to be a complete jerkwad.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, I love her to bits. I always have, and I always will. She's my little sister, and no matter what she does I'd do anything for her. But I just don't know what to do right now. She even messaged me on my birthday asking about money, arranged a meet-up only to never show up (that one really hurt). I just wonder if there's anything I can do at this point. Thanks for listening, and I hope y'all have a good day.\",\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, some backstory. I&amp;#39;m a senior college student with and my little sister is a high school junior. Our mother passed away almost a decade ago and my dad has raised us since then. Ever since she was in middle school, my sister has had a lot of problems on the internet via sexting adult strangers and getting into trouble at school. We tried to help her but she was intent on doing that stuff secretly and we&amp;#39;d occasionally catch her or get notified by the school. She&amp;#39;s now 18 and last year she ran away to live with her 16 year old boyfriend, and ever since she&amp;#39;s just been nasty to me and my dad, ie. telling us to leave her alone and then sending pics of her tattoo to my dad just to make him upset.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Particularly she&amp;#39;s had a strong type of hatred towards me. She keeps saying the worst kind of people always smile and laugh and no one ever seems to dislike them. Nevermind that our mother was just that, there weren&amp;#39;t a lot of people that didn&amp;#39;t like her because she was truly a nice person. And she keeps telling me that I&amp;#39;m not perfect. Obviously, I&amp;#39;m not, kind of a no brainer there. I may not have done what she&amp;#39;s done in life, but I&amp;#39;ve screwed up enough in my own ways. And I openly admit to it. She gets mad that I get to go to college when she&amp;#39;ll be lucky to graduate high school, though no one ever was stopping her and I believe if she really tried, she could do all that and even more. But she seems to resent me for at least trying not to be a complete jerkwad.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I love her to bits. I always have, and I always will. She&amp;#39;s my little sister, and no matter what she does I&amp;#39;d do anything for her. But I just don&amp;#39;t know what to do right now. She even messaged me on my birthday asking about money, arranged a meet-up only to never show up (that one really hurt). I just wonder if there&amp;#39;s anything I can do at this point. Thanks for listening, and I hope y&amp;#39;all have a good day.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

We all split the utilities, and my mom and I do a lot of the yard work and maintenance for both houses, we shuttle my grandma to appointments and my mom looks after them when they\\'re sick or injured, but not serious enough to need medical attention. She does things like help my grandpa with his toenails, and checks in on them, runs errands for them, etc etc.\\n\\nI have called my grandma \"gran\" for probably 10-15 years, it\\'s going to be a very hard habit to break at this point. I don\\'t know why he\\'s just now decided he doesn\\'t like it. I tried to comply at first, to avoid drama, but damn if it isn\\'t hard to call someone something new after so many years. It\\'s making me extremely stressed. Family dinner is a nightmare, I just don\\'t talk to anyone.\\n\\nToday I was chatting with her and said something like \"thanks gran!\" and leaned down to kiss her cheek before I left, and he was like \"THANKS /WHO/???\" I just walked out without answering. I don\\'t know what brought this on, and I\\'m stressed about confronting him, because technically our house is his house so he could kick me and my mom out if he got mad enough.

       "'I am 14 and female. I have been overweight since I could remember and until recently I know why. My parents buy me fast food all the time and encourage bad eating habits. Theres always chips and soda in the house and hardly ever greens and healthier items. Whenever I ask for anything like veggies they say \"there so expensive for what you get\". And they dont enjoy cooking at home. I cook for them most of the time so I can avoid going to fast food.. Whenever I bring up that I dont want to eat at fast food all the time they tell me \"It costs so much more to eat at home\" and \"we dont have time\" \\n\\nLately I\\'ve been trying to lose weight and have been eating healthier but dinner is always a problem, or if I go anywhere with my mom. For breakfast and lunch I make the healthiest meals I can put together for myself, but for dinner, my parents always put fast food on the table at least 3 times a week. Whenever I go out with my mom she says, I\\'m hungry (we were just at home where she could have made a sandwich) and she gets 2 double cheeseburgers and a dr pepper from McDonald\\'s(which is like 800 calories for a \"snack\"). \\n\\nI need a way to get them to stop eating out so much without pissing them off since everything I try to tell them that they have a problem they get mad at me.'"

And they dont enjoy cooking at home. I cook for them most of the time so I can avoid going to fast food..

For breakfast and lunch I make the healthiest meals I can put together for myself, but for dinner, my parents always put fast food on the table at least 3 times a week.

Apologies if this is too long but I need to get this off my chest.\\n\\nI've never got along with my sister, (I'm 24 she's 32) she always treated me like I was a hassle and never had a nice thing to say about me. I feel so isolated because the stories she tells people make me not want to show my face, people know her more so of course they'll believe her over me, she even spread crap to my (already unbearable) Jobcentre work coach.\\n\\nNOTE: I'm struggling to move out because no landlord will have a UC claimant and the DWP are taking 1/3 of my living allowance. I am in touch with housing charities and I am trying to get help. I cant work due to extreme anxiety to the point of frequent dizzy spells, severe migraines, nausea and sometimes even passing out completely.\\n\\n9 months ago I had to leave my flat (for reasons that made me suicidal, not the first time I've been that way) and had to move in with her and her family. I had a long phase where every waking moment was so painful i struggled to breathe. I told her a few thoughts and she responded with \"I always knew you weren't strong enough\". I few days later I overdosed my medication, she found me and had me rushed to A&amp;amp;E, I was in overnight having blood tests and my heart monitored (no lasting effects) the next day she visited and complained how my attempt stopped her from making some kid's birthday cake she promised she'd do. I felt safe at the hospital, the NHS staff were so lovely, when I got back I slowly started to improve (thanks to my wonderful nieces who took it upon themselves to mend my broken heart) and I was determined to help where I could.\\n\\nI cared for ALL the animals, and the kids. I'd happily cook for everyone too, I was happy for a while, but my sister started to get more and more upset with me because of how I cared for her children: mending soft toys, clipping and cleaning scraggly nails, nit treatment and combing, teeth brushing routines and regularly cleaned clothes and bedding (I worship those kids). She tells them she'll help them but shouts if they ask, if I do something for them she says in their faces \"Am I not capable? Ey?\" and storms off. She bit my head off for getting them fed, cleaned and ready for bed while she slept (from 3:45pm - 9pm, past kids bedtime).\\n\\nNext morning she sat next to me on the sofa, looked me in the face with an expression that could kill and says \"You make me feel like such a lousy mother\" and again, storms off.\\n\\nMy sister lives in a pigsty and expects me to clean up after her, she tells me \"compromise goes both ways\" and I'm being lazy, antisocial and a general leech, I do nothing to help myself (apparently). I have decided to be ENTIRELY independent and only care for my own (me and my pets). She and her partner want me to do even more since she got herself pregnant (another one she cant look after). She wants to be with me for the good things but when I need support she shuts me down, she gets extremely stroppy if she doesn't know everything I'm up to, If I don't tell her it means I'm on youtube or playing Skyrim 24/7 making no attempt to better my situation.\\n\\nI feel defenceless around her, she has a very entitled know-it-all attitude that I cant stand. She tells me she hates the way I live (she must mean hygienically, and debt-free with great care for my animals, we've always been opposites)\\n\\nShe's determined she's right but it doesn't feel right to me. What are your thoughts? Am I wrong for keeping out of her way and making sure I only provide for myself and my pets?\\n\\nSorry for my horrible ranty post, my head is a mess, I'm trying my best.\\n\\nThank you</td>\n",

       "      <td>I typed this up as a rant because I have no one to talk to and am crying, feeling extremly angry and hurt. **For reference, I am the oldest (31F). My younger sister (29F) is getting married at the end of August. My brother (27M)  is having a “His and Her” baby shower with his girlfriend this weekend. I am at my parent’s house, where I grew up, currently, hoping to spend the week here leading up to the baby shower this weekend.**\\n\\nMy mother is self-absorbed. She doesn't care that my sister Katie and I were molested by my cousin Nick as a child and that I was treated like shit by my other cousin Ana (his sister) throughout my childhood and caught up in a hurtful, dysfunctional relationship with her as an adult (which ended with y cutting contact completely). My mom is more concerned with keeping “the family together” than acknowledging the damage that was done to me as a child and how it has affected me and continues to affect me as an adult. She is afraid. She is a coward. She is afraid of looking bad. She is afraid of any confrontation even if the outcome would be good for her kids. She makes up stories in her head and believes them and is afraid and paranoid. She was not an active mother to me as a child. But I did love her. She had a very happy and warm energy, and still does.  She was loving and comforting when it was convenient to her. She treated me like an inconvenience. I hated being alive. I hated who I was as a kid. I hate her. I don’t want to be around her or hear her stupid stories. I want to be away from it all.\\n\\nAccording to her, “it’s a good thing Mike (Katie’s fiance) wasn’t able to come to the baby shower because if Nick happens to be there, Mike would be really upset.” What the fuck about ME and KATIE? It doesn’t cross your mind that WE would be upset? How about last summer, when I finally told you about all of this,  and you PROMISED me that I would never ever have to worry about seeing him ever again. She would talk to Aunt Terri and Uncle Paul. She would talk to Kip, my brother,  so that he knows what’s going on. Now that has completely gone out the window. Because she is TOO FUCKING AFRAID. She doesn’t give a fuck about how I feel. It’s about everyone else and her. How SHE will look. How SHE doesn’t want to start conflict in her family. FUCK that bullshit, I want out. I am getting out. After this stupid fucking wedding I will not be around her again. I am only doing this wedding for my sister because it matters to her and I love her. I cannot stand my mother. I want to leave now but at the same time I want to push through and be at the baby shower for my brother. He wouldn’t be hurt or angry if I wasn’t there though. It’s all a fake story that I have in my mind because of my mom. I love him and he loves me but he won’t be heartbroken that I’m not there. It’s a fucking 3 hour party. \\n\\nBut I am an adult. I don’t need to be protected by her. She can do what the hell she wants with the knowledge of what happened to me. She can ignore it and have fake relationship with my aunt and cousins, just how she likes it. I won’t do it and I won’t put up with being around her while she continues to do it. \\n\\nTldr; my mother is ignoring the fact that I was molested as a kid by my cousin, for her own convenience of not having to exclude family members from upcoming family events.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Growing up was hard. My twin sister and I lived with our mum. We lived in over 25 houses in the first 16 years of our lives. One particular year, we moved 4 times. The time came when we knew we would be moving again soon. The knocks on the front door would become more frequent. The hiding in our rooms or under our beds would become more frequent. The inability to answer the house phone would become more frequent. The isolation from mum's \"new close friends\" would begin.\\n\\nWe would start packing up our belongings and saw it is as a competition to see how quickly we could complete this. We became experts, eventually being able to pack and unpack a house in a day. We would put the radio on and sing and dance to music as a way to distract ourselves while packing. It stopped us from dwelling on the fact that we were moving again. It stopped us from thinking about 'why': mum had once again failed to pay the rent and the bills. She owed people money (her new friends, the landlords, her colleagues, her clients, or even our elderly neighbours).\\n\\nHer lies had caught up with her again and she could no longer hide behind them. She had exhausted all her favours. She had exhausted the people's goodwill and they were starting to see the truth. That she had lied and manipulated them. That she had used her children and the fact that she was a single parent as a reason for them to feel sorry for her and to give her the benefit of the doubt. To let her have longer to pay them. To trust or have faith that she would come up with the money. Eventually they all came to the same conclusions. They realised that they needed to cut their losses and find a more reliable tenant. That her promises were empty. That they couldn't help us even if they had tried.\\n\\nThis process continued. Over and over. Mum worked as a carer with elderly first and then the disabled. She worked as a cleaner sometimes too. She had an infectious and bubbly personality. She could make fast friends so easily. Internally and behind closed doors, I look back and can see a lady who was deeply depressed. She would often spend days in bed. She had high levels of anxiety from all the lies she was living with. She was constantly trying to function at a heightened level to keep ahead of her lies. It got to a point where I'm not even sure she knew the difference between the lie she had created and the truth. She was a master manipulator. This was one of her biggest assets in a way, as it allowed her to continue to exploit people to feed her problem. She did this for so many years and never truly suffered the consequences of her actions.\\n\\nWe knew mum had a problem from the age of 7. We heard whispers from our family friends. That she was addicted to gambling. The pokies specifically. My sister and I were left to our own devices from that age. We would often be at home alone. Wondering what to eat. How to get it ready. When to go to school. If she would be home to take us or if we needed to find our own way there. If she would be there to pick us up or if we needed to find our way home. This became our life.\\n\\nWe were independent from a young age, not able to rely on mum to organise things for us. We worried about her of course, as any child would. When she was gone for long periods, we thought the worst.\\n\\nHad something happened to her?\\n\\nHad she crashed her car?\\n\\nHad she been arrested?\\n\\nShe always had excuses about where she was. She had been at work. She had to stay later and longer. She was working hard to earn money to pay rent. Her car had broken down. She was helping a friend. She took someone to the hospital. The list continued.\\n\\nIn the end, we would hop on our bikes and ride from pub to pub. If we found mum's car at least we would know where she was and not have to worry. We would walk the streets late at night. We would climb on the roof and look into the distance, hoping to see her coming home. We didn't advertise to anyone what our home life was like. Our diet included two-minute noodles, macaroni and cheese, toast, and milo.\\n\\nSometimes on pay day, mum would do a shop and we would have food for awhile. Then it would slowly dwindle and we would go back to the basics. This has definitely impacted my diet to this day. Food has always been the lowest priority. We were used to going without.\\n\\nMum was on the wrong side of the law a few times over different periods growing up. From when we were 8, mum had some friends who could make money growing cannabis in their sheds and cupboards. The allure of money won mum over. Even though we were renting, her and her friends set up shop in the garden shed. They converted it into a hydroponic set up with the fluorescent lights and black lining over the walls. We didn't think too much of it. We knew it was illegal but after the first few crops and an influx of money, mum seemed happier. We had more food than we'd had in awhile. We didn't move house when the month came to the end so it seemed like there were more positives at the time.\\n\\nThe problem with this was that mum still had her underlying addiction. Often, she would receive the influx of cash and spend bigger at the pokies for longer. In the end, it only fuelled her problem to some degree. We continued to move house. The garden sheds got a little bigger and the crops got a little larger. We came home one day to find the crops were ready to dry out. The whole house smelt. Mum was sitting on the floor in the rumpus room with newspaper and scissors. She was cutting the cannabis. We sat down and helped her. I think we were 8.\\n\\nReflecting back on this with my sister, we laughed. We laughed at many things. We laughed at how we used to make a game of remembering the names of the streets we'd lived in and what order they were in from when we were born until now. We laughed at cutting cannabis with mum when we were 8. We laughed at the police and debt collectors who knocked on our doors repetitively over the years. We laughed at how mum had told them she was our aunty a couple of times and got away with it. We laughed at how mum used to change her last name. For bills, for jobs, for house applications. We couldn't keep up.\\n\\nWas it Harvey or Watts or Nitsche?\\n\\nWe weren't sure. It allowed her to get away with things for longer.\\n\\nLaughing, it seems, is one of our many coping mechanisms. In a way, we have compartmentalised this part of our life and locked it away. By not talking about it, we haven't really dealt with our feelings and we were both afraid of the impact of this on us now and later. This is why we have decided to share our stories.\\n\\nMum was the ultimate fraudster. She was given charge of our local soccer club finances one year. I think they figured she used to work in a bank so she was good with sums. They weren't to know she had an addiction and shouldn't be trusted. Mum used her knowledge of banks to then spend all of our soccer club's money. She got passed the need for two signatures and withdrew that money. I will never know how she got away with that and how no one pressed charges. The club folded soon after.\\n\\nAnother brush with the law came when mum was housesitting a work colleague's house. Unbeknownst to us, while her work colleague was overseas, she began pawning off her belongings. Jewellery, sporting equipment, electronics and the list goes on. This showed a desperate but opportunistic woman. Of course, her friend returned from overseas. She quickly realised her stuff was gone. She went to the police and this was mum's most serious encounter with the law. I remember she had to get lawyers. She went to court. The investigation and process dragged on for months. Mum was stressed and depressed. She asked our grandma to help her. Grandma gave her money. She paid for the lawyers. She bailed her out of another problem. She didn’t want us to be without mum. She didn’t want mum to have a criminal record. If only grandma could understand that she wasn't doing her any favours. Mum continued to gamble. She continued to lie. She continued to owe people money. I sometimes wish Grandma had let mum suffer the consequences of her actions back then. Maybe she could have been helped. We will never know.\\n\\nIn our minds, as my sister and I became more aware of what was going on, we decided we just needed to get through school. We wanted to be better. We wanted to do better. We needed to get away from this life we were living. We had aspirations and somehow, despite our role models, we knew right from wrong. We despised lies. We despised debt. We tolerated our mum but we didn't like what she had become or how she treated people. It got to the point where we didn't believe a single word out of her mouth. Everything seemed to be a lie. Even if she was just talking about her day, about a conversation she had with someone. Nothing could be taken as the truth anymore.\\n\\nMy sister and I threw ourselves into our schooling and our sport. Those were our outlets. Those got us through. The times continued to be tough. We held on to the thought that if we aimed high, we could eventually walk away from all this. We had each other. We inspired each other and we always felt so lucky to be twins. It was a blessing that there were two of us to support each other whilst we struggled through this life together.\\n\\nMum started to unravel at times when her guilt and desperation reached heightened levels. She would take her stress and anger out on us. She manipulated us into feeling like a burden. Like all her money problems were because of us. She would be irrational. She would search our rooms for money. We would have to hide. We were scared when she was in these states. We would sometimes roam the streets until she calmed down.\\n\\nWe kept our lives a secret. No one knew. Not our teachers. Not our friends. We were embarrassed and in a way, we felt guilty. We had lied. We had lied to many people. It had become second nature. We put up a facade in order to get the next house.\\n\\nIn order to keep mum out of trouble.\\n\\nWe didn't want her to go to jail and where would we live?\\n\\nWe weren't innocent.\\n\\nWe contributed to people being hurt.\\n\\nTo people being deceived and manipulated.\\n\\nIt was wrong but we felt trapped.\\n\\nWhere else could we have gone?\\n\\nI don't regret many things in life but I do regret this. We were selfish. We were in self-preservation mode. We went along with the lies, which was wrong. Many people were affected by our mum's actions. Too many to name. They lost money. They had their trust broken. They even lost belongings that she sold or pawned. Some people were so vulnerable that they had no chance to even say no. The elderly, the disabled, and even her own family.\\n\\nThe last straw came many years later. Our grandma was progressing with her dementia. As the grandchildren, we didn't want to get too involved with grandma's finances. It's usually the parents who take care of these matters when they arise. Our grandma had one daughter and one son. Her son, on our recommendation, had placed grandma's money in a fixed term deposit account, not attached to her normal bank account. We had thought this would be enough to stop mum from accessing the bulk of grandma's money. But we were wrong.\\n\\nMum had gotten around that and taken grandma into the bank. She got her to sign a form to put the money in her normal account and had been withdrawing that money slowly but surely over a few months. Our uncle found this out when he came over from Tasmania for a holiday. He exposed the ugly truth. That mum could sink so low that she would exploit her own family. Her mother who had helped her time and time again over the years. Her mother who had dementia and was so trusting of her. She prayed on the most vulnerable. Grandma had always believed that mum could get better. That she deserved second chances.\\n\\nWe were all angry. At mum and at ourselves. We should have known mum wouldn't stop. That no one was off limits to her addiction and her lies. Since that day, we haven't seen or spoken to mum.\\n\\nMy sister and I took over caring for our grandma. We love her dearly. She is now in a nursing home. Mum doesn't know where she is. She has never visited her. Grandma asks about her most days. She knows what she did and it hurts her to think of what her daughter has become. For me, I feel better not having mum in my life. It's definitely easier. I don't have to worry what is coming next. I don't have to worry about answering my phone. I don't have to worry about debt collectors or friends chasing money from her.\\n\\nThe sad thing is that we don't know where mum is. We wouldn't know if she is dead or alive and that haunts me in my dreams.</td>\n",

Whenever my mom asks me questions I am very cold and short with her and look forward to the conversation ending. My step dad I don't like at all because he is mopey drunk with OCD, and act's like a nice guy in order to get what he wants from my mom which never works so he just pouts around the house. My mother is really nice and always try's to do stuff for me and I just act like a complete dick to her for no reason. She drinks her fair share too and I hate drunk people in general so I avoid them both all together when they drink.\\n\\nMy problem is that even when they are not drinking I always feel awkward to be nice to them and smile around them. I beat myself up over it because I know one day my mom will not be around any more and I will just be left with regret that I didn't even try to have a good relationship. My mom is constantly asking me if everything is alright and it always starts an argument when I snap at her and say that I am fine. I talked to my sister about this today and she said that I'm even cold with her and that I just need to get over it and try.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Long post. Tldr at the bottom.\\n\\nWithin the past year, I (21 f) have been slowly realizing that I don't think I have a good relationship with my mom.\\n\\nFor a while, I've just felt like I need to grow up or that we just have really different personalities and it's my fault I dont like to be around her. I was really excited to go to college so I didnt have to interact with her as often and, again, thought I might have just been overreacting or hormonal. I've always made excuses to not visit her since then. I usually dont text her first and when I do it's because I feel guilty for not having interacted with her for a few days, not because I really want to. Sometimes when she texts me I dont even respond for a whole day. I can't quite put my finger on why I feel like this but I recently realized something that might help me put the puzzle together.\\n\\nFor years my mom and my dads mom have had beef. I'm pretty sure this was an ordeal even before I was born. I didn't really realize it was happening until I was about 15. My mom started talking mad shit about her around that time but it was never really specific. I have personally witnessed my dads mom say some shady things and so having only my own mothers side of the story I naturally sided with her. \\n\\nMy mom and dad did not have a happy marriage for very long. I remember from a very young age that they had some issues. But that's a whole 'nother can of worms to step in. I was in my mid teens when my mom started to \"open up\"  about her and my dads relationship. My dad never really talked to me (I daresay he was emotionally neglectful but again that's even another can of worms) so I never really got his side of the story. My mom just said some absolutely terrible things about my dad then when she was done ranting she would say something nice about him. Hindsight it just seems like she was afraid I would say something to him so she was just trying to cover her steps but idk. The point is she got me to take her side.\\n\\nThey finally got divorced last year and my dad has been very honest with me about the whole thing. He is telling me what my mom did wrong just like my mom always (always...) tells me what he did wrong. But what he does that's different than my mom is understand his own role in the failed marriage. He knows exactly where he went wrong and he is really trying to change for the better. And him opening up to me like that made me realize just how much my mom lied to me and manipulated me to hate my dad. \\n\\nThroughout my childhood she always threw shade at my friends and their families which has ultimately ruined multiple friendships, so like... more than one. Like I'm just realizing this as I'm writing this but she rarely had anything good to say about any of my friends and their families. I feel like a total asshole having taken her side so often. Again, I thought I had done something wrong but...\\n\\nI'm finally a semi functional person with somewhat coherent thoughts and I guess I'm just starting to notice a pattern. I keep my distance from my mom because she makes me uncomfortable. My mom has always thrown mad shade at my dad and his mom. My dad opening up to me realized that my mom was telling me lies about him and it just makes me wonder what she was lying about my grandmother (dads mom) and my friends. Or what kinds of lies shes saying about me to her friends. She always made me believe she had a good relationship with me but I'm certainly questioning that now.\\n\\nIdk, maybe I'm overthinking this or reading this situation wrong but it feels good to get this off my chest at least. \\n\\nTldr: my mom has said some really terrible things about a lot of the people in my life and I have always taken her side and I'm just now realizing why I don't like being around her.</td>\n",

He was a passenger in a car on the way back from a work meeting, and another car crashed head on into the car my brother was in.  My brother, and all in the car he was in were innocent.

There was no doubt my Brothers cat knew that was a special day - as there were celebrations at my Brothers home that day in the past, and the cat knew it was a special day.  He (the cat) would have wondered what happened to my Brother.  My Brothers cat, and this is so sad to me, probably thought that my Brother deserted him (the Cat).  But the Cat held hope years after.  But it brings tears to my eyes for hours, because we could not communicate to the poor Cat that he was not deserted by his beloved owner, but that his owner was stolen from him, and all of us.\\n\\nAnd that is so so sad.  That beautiful and loyal animal had to suffer thinking his beloved owner deserted him.\\n\\nNo matter what, this is sad - and I feel the pain for that poor little cat....</td>\n",

We had a lot in common and were best friends. She said she loved me more than any other person in the entire world, and I felt the same about her. I didn't want to get married or have kids one day. I just wanted to live with her for the rest of my life, and she was more than happy with the idea of me never moving out. We were like soulmates/soultwins/twinflames (whatever you want to call it) on a spiritual and emotional level level. Loving only one person intensely is the only way I really know how to love. I can't comprehend within myself how people are able to greatly love multiple people- siblings, two parents, in-laws, etc. But in order to move forward and find love again- I know I will likely have to learn to love this way. But I honestly don't know how. I try to imagine/fantasize myself one day with a child, a daughter/son-in-law, and having grandkids to dote on. It might sound silly?? but I can't picture it and there is a lot of internal conflict and even heartbreak when I think about it. And it's also hard to know that I will likely never have someone again that loves me with such intensity as my mom, and only me. I'm at a loss and don't know how to move forward in life.

There's quite a bit to it in terms of my relationship with my dad..\\n\\nI come from an Asian family and for some reason this sometimes means we just never communicate about our emotions. My dad unfortunately lost his job due to a fire and he's been doing manual labour type jobs his whole life. He loves it but obviously it has taken a huge toll on his physical health. He's generally ok but has a lot of pain in his legs and back because of his jobs but also because of various health issues. This is important to mention because he just refuses to do anything active like going for a run or a walk if the weather is nice just to kill time.\\n\\nI feel bad for him that he's now been sitting at home for a couple of weeks seeming really bored. I would like to add he IS actively looking for jobs but not getting  anywhere because of his lack of qualifications. He occasionally goes out with his friends but obviously they all work so that's hard to do. I don't want to continue to watch him like this but equally I don't know how to talk to him about it in fear he'll think I'm just taking pity on him (this is where the whole Asian family type stuff comes in).\\n\\nWhat do you guys think I could do with my Dad to help him actually live life a little? I'm a 22 yr old female btw, currently have all the time in the world as I just graduated and don't start my Master's programme until September, so I have time to help him out.\\n\\nI hope you guys can help, thank you so much if you've read this.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I'm hesitant to post this as I've never posted in an open forum before, but I'm really hoping someone might be able to give me some helpful advice on this. My older brother is 37 years old, and has been dealing with depression since his very early teens. He has been on medication this entire time, different ones prescribed by different doctors. He sees a therapist regularly. He meditates daily. Some days he's okay, and can laugh every now and then. But most of time he just seems miserable and emotionless.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTo give a better perspective on our family dynamic, here's an overly long paragraph about us:\\n\\nMy parents separated when I was 6 (brother was 9). It wasn't a super messy split, but my dad refused to pay child support for quite a long time, and my mom ended up having to use all of her savings on court/lawyers fees to try and get him to pay. We lived with my mom (she struggled to get by for years), and saw my dad every other weekend. My dad's entire life has always revolved around soccer. He lives and breathes it. Most of my childhood was spent at the soccer field: my mom played it, I played it, my brother played it for a couple years, and my dad coached women's soccer teams, took teams to tournaments and ran the leagues in our city. To this day, a conversation with my dad would include a lengthy chat about soccer. I know he definitely chose soccer over visiting with us numerous times.\\n\\nIn all honesty, I don't really remember my childhood being that bad, I still felt loved by both my parents. But my brother seems to think differently. He has a very heavy dislike (hatred?) towards my dad. And my mom too, but mostly my dad.\\n\\nGrowing up, my brother always did really well in school. He's the smart one in the family, and has always has good jobs. He's had to loan my mom money several times in his life. I think he resents her for not being able to take care of us \"properly\".\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOur family has also never been one to go out of our way to communicate with each other. We don't have any deep conversations about feelings, and we never have. My mom and I are very close, and I'm also quite close to my dad. My brother feels like an outcast. I recently found this out when him and I had a little drunk heart-to-heart outside of a wedding celebration. He thinks he's not like us, and he feels like he doesn't belong when our extended family gets together. (My mom lives in a separate building on the same property as my aunt/uncle, so by extended family I mean mom/brother/me/aunt/uncle/cousins).\\n\\nWhen we're together, he's usually pretty quiet, although if he's in an okay mood he's very funny and can laugh and be sarcastic with the rest of us. He really is a lot of fun when he's at his best. It's rare though.\\n\\nA lot of the time he's sarcastic, I'd say almost to a hurtful extent. I've dealt with it my entire life, so I take people's insults as jokes. I've always laughed off comments that my brother made to me, even if they were true. I think my dad did the same. My mom takes my brother's comments to heart.\\n\\nI've been paying attention more recently to how he acts around me compared to how he acts around my parents. I moved in with him a few months ago (temporary job), and have noticed that for the most part, he can laugh and joke with me. I make stupid comments and he laughs, it's quite fun. When we're around our parents, he is very different. This is when he'll be quiet, moody, barely smile. He'll make little jabs at my mom (like I said, she takes them to heart, I can see the hurt in her eyes when he says them), and if he's around my dad it's so much worse. He endlessly (somewhat subtly) tells my dad that he's a shitty person. He makes so many snide remarks towards him, being completely serious, but my dad tends to laugh them off (I guess I learned this from him).\\n\\nMy dad is a hoarder, by the way. Not like the garbage everywhere kind, but he keeps everything. He has rooms piled with things (a lot of soccer stuff), and he doesn't clean the house or take care of himself. I know that he's recently gone a month without showering. He's also slowing down in his age (71), so I'm worried about him.\\n\\nI think the hoarding that my dad is doing has created an even bigger divide between my dad and brother. My dad makes no effort to call/text/keep in touch with my brother. My brother barely makes an attempt at talking to my dad. Every now and then my brother will call him when he's waiting to board a plane (because he knows he'll have to hang up in a certain amount of time).\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI've frequently googled how to help a depressed friend or family member, and all I get are the same results. \"Tell them you're there to listen, encourage them to get help, tell them it gets better\". I've told him I'm here to listen, he doesn't want to talk to me. He's been seeing a therapist for many years now, and has taken countless medications. He's been depressed since he was about 14, and it hasn't gotten any better for him.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHe's still alone. He's had a girlfriend every now and then but nothing for more than a year or so. He's never been married. I know he wants to get married, I know he'd even like to have a kid one day. I think this gets to him a lot that he's still single.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt makes me so incredibly sad to see him like this, and I don't know how to help him. He truly is a great guy, and he deserves to find happiness and enjoyment in his life.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAny advice to approach this would be greatly appreciated.</td>\n",

It’s always been borderline emotionally abusive, sometimes physical (my mom has thrown things at my dad and has hit him). \\nA couple years ago my dad almost died because of diabetes and is now disabled. As of now he’s prescribed oxy for the pain, and has been on it for 2 years. However, he is abusing it, and snorts it, passes out and drools on himself, etc. He has also started drinking again, at first it was just a couple glasses of wine, and now we have to hide any beer we have in the house. He’s an alcoholic, addicted to oxy, on the couch literally 24/7, and isn’t the nicest person. \\nMy mother isn’t the nicest either, I feel that she can be pretty selfish a lot of the time. For example, she hasn’t done her taxes in 2 years, gets mad when I ask her to, and I haven’t been able to apply for FAFSA. I’m always scared to say anything not positive about her behavior because she gets mad, yells at me, and insults me, usually calling me a drama queen and telling me to get over it. Because of my dad’s disability, bills are a little harder to pay because he’s not working anymore, and my mom isn’t working either. \\nI am currently going to school for social work, and a lot of the time my mom comes to me with her issues because I have the right responses. However, I don’t want to be her therapist. She will talk to me about very personal problems, sometimes even bringing up her and my father’s sex life. A few months ago she had a mental breakdown, and our house was almost in foreclosure. I was the only one in the family who knew about this besides my mom, my brother and sister had no idea. She comes to me with these issues of money, running through all of their savings, 401K, etc. She talks to me about leaving him, moving away, and needing to “put herself first for once.” She also complains about how my dad is basically just killing himself, as he also had collapsed lungs and is smoking cigarettes a lot. But my mom also smokes, and I brought up how she shouldn’t smoke either because if she ends up in the hospital like my father did, I’ll have to deal with it all, as my siblings will most definitely not be helpful. When I said this she just brushed it off and said something along the lines of “I know, your father is useless and won’t help”\\n\\nHow do I tell my mom that this is an inappropriate relationship and it makes me super uncomfortable to be expected to act as her therapist? I try to distance myself but a lot of the time she just makes any conversation about this. Once we got in a fight and I tried to bring up how I don’t want to know about their issues, and she compared it to me having fights with my own boyfriend. I feel that going to your mother with relationship problems (and I never talk about sex or anything like that) is a totally different dynamic than what she is doing to me. \\nAm I in the wrong for not wanting to hear these issues from my mother?</td>\n",

I will answer all that write snailmail. I am tired of just looking out of a window at cars stopped at a stop light. Want someone that I can write and get to know. I like music of any kind also. So, what are you waiting for?! Hurry up and grab a pen and write that letter! You really dont want to miss the thoughts and ideas I have to present! Dont let me be the one you almost wrote, and wondered about. Go ahead and write me! We can talk about anything! I am:\\n\\nDanny Clark 83588\\n\\nP.O.

He wanted me to tell everyone who emailed him, that if he could, he would individually thank every one of you, but sadly the prison is limiting him on how many he can see at a time. He isn't sure he will be able to even see them all. He did say he was sorry to anyone who wrote that he isn't able to respond to, and it is the prison saying he cant, not him. We were not expecting this much of a response! Because of this, I am removing the email information. He also said anyone who would like to write snail mail and talk to him that way is still welcome to do so. The prison cant really limit that. I do want everyone who wrote him to know that all of you truly helped him (and my family) in a way we could never thank you for.  Tonight as we were getting off of the phone, he said hes actually been seeing the beauty in people again, instead of the ugly he has for so many years. This whole thing has completely restored both of our faiths in humanity and the goodness that is within strangers from all over the world. Thank you all so much for the life you have put back into my dad.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Okay, some backstory. I'm a senior college student with and my little sister is a high school junior. Our mother passed away almost a decade ago and my dad has raised us since then. Ever since she was in middle school, my sister has had a lot of problems on the internet via sexting adult strangers and getting into trouble at school. We tried to help her but she was intent on doing that stuff secretly and we'd occasionally catch her or get notified by the school. She's now 18 and last year she ran away to live with her 16 year old boyfriend, and ever since she's just been nasty to me and my dad, ie. telling us to leave her alone and then sending pics of her tattoo to my dad just to make him upset.\\n\\nParticularly she's had a strong type of hatred towards me. She keeps saying the worst kind of people always smile and laugh and no one ever seems to dislike them. Nevermind that our mother was just that, there weren't a lot of people that didn't like her because she was truly a nice person. And she keeps telling me that I'm not perfect. Obviously, I'm not, kind of a no brainer there. I may not have done what she's done in life, but I've screwed up enough in my own ways. And I openly admit to it. She gets mad that I get to go to college when she'll be lucky to graduate high school, though no one ever was stopping her and I believe if she really tried, she could do all that and even more. But she seems to resent me for at least trying not to be a complete jerkwad.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, I love her to bits. I always have, and I always will. She's my little sister, and no matter what she does I'd do anything for her. But I just don't know what to do right now. She even messaged me on my birthday asking about money, arranged a meet-up only to never show up (that one really hurt). I just wonder if there's anything I can do at this point. Thanks for listening, and I hope y'all have a good day.</td>\n",

I have been sorting through some of my own problems and cutting toxic people out of my life and it was there when I realized that my mom was toxic and at that moment I realized I do not want to cut my mom out of my life, and she won't listen to any one of us alone so we staged an intervention.\\n\\nWe all said our piece and when we were done I looked at my mom, and for the first time since I was a little kid who was obligated to, I looked at her and said \"Mom.

My mom lives in a second house on my grandparents' property, and has since she had me (single mom). We all split the utilities, and my mom and I do a lot of the yard work and maintenance for both houses, we shuttle my grandma to appointments and my mom looks after them when they're sick or injured, but not serious enough to need medical attention. She does things like help my grandpa with his toenails, and checks in on them, runs errands for them, etc etc.\\n\\nI have called my grandma \"gran\" for probably 10-15 years, it's going to be a very hard habit to break at this point. I don't know why he's just now decided he doesn't like it. I tried to comply at first, to avoid drama, but damn if it isn't hard to call someone something new after so many years. It's making me extremely stressed. Family dinner is a nightmare, I just don't talk to anyone.\\n\\nToday I was chatting with her and said something like \"thanks gran!\" and leaned down to kiss her cheek before I left, and he was like \"THANKS /WHO/???\" I just walked out without answering. I don't know what brought this on, and I'm stressed about confronting him, because technically our house is his house so he could kick me and my mom out if he got mad enough. My current strategy is just avoiding interaction with him, which also sucks-- because prior to all this nonsense, we got along great.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: I did talk to my grandma about it, and she said it doesn't bother her that I call her gran. She's very non confrontational, but also extremely honest. I know that if she'd told him that she didn't care for the nickname, she would have told me as much. She, for better or worse, won't confront him about it. But said that I could call her gran if I wanted to and that he didn't have a right to tell me, what I should call *her.*</td>\n",

Not to mention that most of the agents so far do not seem to have any sort of credibility as far as I can see and are likely to steal money.

Sorry for English, not a native speakeŕ.\\n\\nI (M20) just finished my first year at uni in UK, my sister (F15) and parents live in a different country so I can't really know what is happening at home, I went there just twice for a week since September. My sister just told me that she had found out about the cheating about two months ago. Genuinely, I didn't believe her, it would never even cross my mind. But she took pictures of my mom's conversation and I must admit it is sadly 100% true. (btw My sis waited those two months to tell me what's happening until I come home, which must have been so hard for her and she has all of the credit for that.)\\n\\nI was always saying that my parents are very contrasting in so many things and/or opinions. My dad is super stressed about everything, and quite disgusted by life, I'd say that the family has been the main engine in his life in last 10 years. He's not very happy with the way he lives and money he earns, but I know on 100% that he always gave everything to all three of us. I feel like he is a bit disappointed that he didn't do something big during the life, like he must have failed or something, can't really describe that properly but that might be quite normal at this lifestage (?) I can see that feeling was getting stronger and stronger in last few years.\\n\\nMy mom is calm, but sometimes even naive, and also quite submissive in the sense of making any decisions, she just says \"I don't really care\" or \"It doesn't matter that much\". When there were any small arguments it is usually because of the discrepancy in these character features.\\n\\nI don't think that the age difference between them is the problem. Mom has always been into older guys, and sadly it is this time as well. I also doubt it is about money.\\n\\nI have no idea what to do. I am thinking about telling to my uncle's girlfriend. I know I can tell her everything with honesty. She also stands kinda both in and out of the family as she knows my uncle (and thus my parents actually) for 15 years or so but doesn't plan a wedding or something and I believe she can see the thing subjectively.\\n\\nI also kinda plan to confront my mom about that = should I ???? If yes, how the fuck??\\n\\nAlso, I am leaving in two weeks again and the last thing is to ruin the family and then just leave, so I must be really careful with what I'm doing.\\n\\ntl;dr: My mom is cheating on my father, should I confront her??</td>\n",

This may be a wall of text too because so much needs explaining, so I do apologise for that.\\n\\nSo as the title says, pretty much my whole family have had enough of my mum and she knows this, although she doesn’t understand why. \\n\\nLet me start by saying she is a fantastic grandma to her grandchildren, she loves them and absolutely adores them. She is battling COPD and a plethora of health issues as well as depression, anxiety and PTSD from my grandmas death 4 years ago. That being said, her personality and behaviour is pushing family members away, and as I am closest to her, I feel it is my responsibility to explain why seeing as she’s noticed people becoming distant and/or angry with her and doesn’t understand why.\\n\\nMy mum is quite narcissistic, always has to be right, gives unsolicited advice, rants about people treating her like shit all the time, she’s two faced, constantly has a need for attention and that’s just off the top of my head. \\n \\nA few months ago, a family member I’ll call AH attempted suicide and, although she was specifically told not to go to the hospital, she went anyway. She said she was there to support AH’s children and the rest of the family. Everyone was so worried as AH had been clinically dead for some time, but my mum went around telling everyone that she had got people praying for her and she’s be fine. AH pulled through and her vitals stabilised and my mum had the ‘told you so’ mentality, but then to take things further she actually told people ‘told you she’d be fine, I’ve had people praying for her, it’s not her time’!, which obviously annoyed the shit out of people there. She couldn’t understand why people were being cold and sharp with her. It really did hurt her, but I struggle to explain why the way she acted was the reason why.\\nThen came the ‘I have mental health issues too, but no one rushes to my side when I’m in crisis’. This was the day after AH hung herself and was found clinically dead, it was because my brother was visiting as he is close to that side of family and my mum has a bit of a fractured relationship with that side. Recently, my mum and AH’s husband were chatting about AH and AH’s husband  sent my mum a couple of videos of AH as she had brain damage from the lack of oxygen. My mum obviously had to bloody ask him to let her and all of her other friends pray for her and he lost it with her. It’s just not his belief. And its annoying. She rang me in tears and all I could say was ‘ Oh you know what he’s like’. \\n\\nEveryone is just so sick of her, I love her to bits but she’s driving me mad too. She’ll ring me to rant about family members, how she’s feels like no one respects her etc.. and it’s never a positive experience to talk to her in the phone. I have depression and anxiety and I’m struggling with two small children to make it through the day, and her phone calls make me feel so much worse. But if I tell her this, she’ll tell me ‘at least you don’t have PTSD and COPD too’. \\n\\nI’m just lost and I don’t know how to approach this with her. I feel like I’ll be criticising everything about her and she’ll feel attacked, which is usually how she reacts to anyone trying to discuss her behaviour with her. \\n\\nHas anyone got any advice please? \\n\\nI’m sorry for the wall of text, I have missed loads out but it’s 10am and I have two very bored toddlers wanting my attention, also it would be one hell of a long read. I also apologise for the formatting as I’m on mobile.\\n\\nTLDR; mum is annoying everyone and is hurt by everyone’s reaction to her, I want to explain why people are being cold/sharp/ distant with her in a loving way.</td>\n",

But despite that she is an amazing young woman and I’m so proud of her.\\n\\nMy oldest daughter is turning 18 tomorrow and I’m proud as fuck of her. She finds too much affection uncomfortable so I’ve kept things toned down for her but I need to tell people just how amazing she is. I took my 2 girls and left their father when they were 3 and 1.5 years old, the day after he shoved me against a wall and put his hands on my throat. The abuse had been going on for years, mostly verbal and sexual ( sexual to me only, not the girls) that eventually turned physical. That started 9 years of going in and out of family court, narcissistic abuse from their father and eventual step mother, threats from him to make the police take them from me so they’d never see him again and one incident of near kidnapping. I’d have to counsel the girls when they come from visiting him and counsel them before they went back. Eventually the girls refused to see him any more and we went to court for the last time - and he agreed to me having 100% custody. But when she went to high school there was a teacher that looked, acted and sounded like her father and she had a breakdown. She was so scared and emotional, she blamed herself for everything, for not being good enough, smart enough or thin and pretty enough. She started cutting herself and was actively suicidal. I was so scared for her and I just wanted to go into her brain and erase all the horrible, derogatory things that her father said to her so that she could be a normal, happy teenager. But I couldn’t so I took her to a psychologist. For 5 years. She has PTSD, general anxiety, health anxiety and depression. We worked really hard together to challenge her automatic thoughts that told her things were going to go wrong and it will be her fault and she needed to be punished (her father, being a narcissist, was never happy or satisfied with anything the girls did and would punish them for not meeting his ridiculously high expectations. When he was no longer there to punish her, she punished herself by cutting). She was close to overdosing on paracetamol 4 times that I know of, popped out the pills, held them in her hand but threw them away instead. She stopped cutting a couple of years ago. She learned how to self regulate her emotions. She learned how to reflect on actions and thoughts to chose an alternative behaviour next time. She is incredibly tolerant and accepting of others and an advocate for animals and the LGBT community. 2 weeks ago she sat for her driving learners test - an extremely anxiety provoking situation - and passed with 100%. She donates her pocket money to worthy causes such as vet bills or families in hardship (we had a house fire almost 3 years ago and she remembers how hard that was and how much the community and complete strangers helped us, so she wants to give back). She is looking at going to TAFE this year as a pathway to uni. My first baby is turning 18 tomorrow and I couldn’t be prouder of the amazing young woman she is.

I lost my temper and I told her straight out that I will NOT prep/cook food in her filthy kitchen that has clearly not been properly cleaned in months until things are up to my standards. \\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThen she turned around and tried to play some guilt trip about \"Well, I'm sorry that things are not up to your standards.\" \\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI didn't say anything after that, but I'm thinking to myself \"Standards?\" \\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThere's a basic level of sanitation that an individual SHOULD keep up...THEN there's standards. That place wasn't even up to a basic level of sanitation. \\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI feel bad...but then again, I don't...because I feel I got it across to her that she lives like a pig.</td>\n",

I would always be the mean one though ;p And I can't guarantee my kids will even see their cousins anymore as their parents make their new lives.\\n2.

       "      <td>I don't know if this should go here, but it's about my brother, sooo.. Yea. TL:DR at the end. Sorry for any grammar error. \\n\\nA little bit of background. My dad and my brother are very explosive when they get angry, but my brother has the habit of slamming doors and throwing tantrums when he gets mad. Also he gets mad very easily. He gets angry when he's hungry, he gets angry when he's sleepy, he gets angry when he's sick, you get the idea. \\nAlso, my brother and my sister get a little bit of money every 2 weeks for school, lunch, and busses. \\n\\nSo this follows 3 incidents with my brother's tantrums.\\n\\nThe first incident happened a month ago or so. My little sister was bothering him and he got angry, slamming open our front bars door and in doing so cracking the wall. A piece of wall fell of and my parents got mad at him, but not punishment fell in him that day.\\n\\nThe second one was a week ago. I was in the common room with my mom and we were watching \"A star is born\". Now, I tend to comment a lot about movies at home. I talk about the plot, the music the actors and so on. And my voice is kinda loud. That day my brother was sick in his bedroom. Aaand, that movie took me into an emotional roller-coaster so I was laughing, crying and kinda screaming with my mom. My brother got mad and asked for me to turn down my voice, fair enough, I lower the volume and say if we're bothering him, he could close the door. We continue watching the movie, and then he just slammed the door. My mom went and scolded him about it, saying how he doesn't get mad when his friends are staying for the night and making a lot of noise even when my dad and I are trying to sleep because we have work. Again, nothing meaningful happens to him.\\n\\nBut lastly, that weekend karma came for his soul.\\n\\nThat Sunday, my mom, my granny, my sister and I went to get some groceries, my dad went to road with his friends and my brother stayed home. My mom called him after we went to ask him to wash the dishes and broom a little. He tried to protest but said yes. 30 minutes later he calls my mom and the conversation went as follows :\\n\\nBro : Hey... Mom... Can.. Can you buy a new doorknob please?\\nMom: a new doorknob? Why?\\nBro: The... Kitchen doorknob... Broke.\\n\\nTurns out, Bro didn't liked being asked to clean, so in his way out to get the broom he shut open the kitchen door, slamming the doorknob on the wall and leaving it useless. My mom had enough. She handed him that Monday his money for the 2 weeks (maybe 17 dollars) and said to him he had to buy a new doorknob himself, with his money.\\nNow, my mom packs my sibling some lunch so they can eat at recess, but the money is for any craving or a movie. Needless to say he lost almost all of his money for the two weeks and only had left money for the bus home.\\n\\nTL:DR: Bro likes to trow tantrums, breaks our kitchen doorknob and losses almost all his money for 2 weeks.</td>\n",

She's getting on a bit, really suffers with her bones and has a couple of hernias in her stomach. She claims PIP and ESA and was supporting my brother on this money before I made arrangements to move back in so I can help her with the bills and housework.\\n\\nReddit, I need your advice on what to do about my brother. \\n\\nHe is 20 and honestly a massive waste of human existence. He sits in his room with his chav friends all day every day playing on his Xbox, smoking mum's tobacco and eating food he so thoughtfully cooked for himself and his friends without asking us first. This pattern of behaviour only changes on weekends. From Friday until Monday, he disappears with his aforementioned friends. When he comes back, he's usually high on weed, coke, speed, MDMA and God only knows what else. This is just the stuff I know he takes. I also have reason to suspect he was stealing mum's pills as well before I came back because I caught him in the act of stealing some of my medication. I've since hidden all of mine and mum's prescription meds, along with our money and bank cards because I just can't trust him not to steal from us. \\n\\nHe refuses to get a job, doesn't claim JSA and won't even attempt to get PIP for his supposed mental illness (tbh I think the only mental illness he has is self-inflicted with drug use). \\n\\nWhen I last visited before moving down here, he bullied and emotionally manipulated mum into buying him a new iPhone because he threw the old one in temper and smashed it. She bought him one despite me telling her to put her foot down. He doesn't even clean his own piss off the toilet seat and refuses to help around the house.\\n\\nReddit, I'm at my wits end with him. Mum doesn't want to kick him out because it'll make him homeless, and I don't want to drive a wedge between me and her by doing it myself. But I don't know how much longer I can handle his appalling behaviour and laziness. What the hell can I do about him?</td>\n",

He got put in a magnet class (which is a class for the smart kids in school) i wasnt in a class like that though. I was in a regular class like some of the people out there.

It wasnt until this happened, when he got a computer. Me \"hey brother can i come in\" brother \"why\" me \"because i wanna play\" brother \"ok\" me (comes in)\"hey\" brother \"hey\" when i looked at the computer a discord message popped up at the bottom right part of the screen saying something of the lines \"wanna fuck me\" and i was in shock pretending i didnt see it and left the room and after that hes been mean and abusive to my whole family and doing what he wants when ever he wants but we got used to it.

       "      <td>I posted something similar to what is below last year on reddit:\\n\"Last year my father passed away suddenly. I saw him on the operation table and it obvious many different types of procedures were recently attempted to try to save him when I arrived with my mom to see him. My brother later came with his fiance and saw him before my dad was cleaned up and put in another room. What followed that day and later that month totally took me by surprise. My grandmother told my brother the day of my dads death that my dad left \"nothing\" for her and my uncle called for official death certificates while we were still in the hospital. My mom brother, his fiance and I all expressed outrage that people could be so mean and cruel. Then out of then blue probably a week or so after the funeral my brothers fiance told my mom that an attorney told her(sil) that the kids(which includes my brother who she eventually married, my other brother and me)get half of the estate. I couldn't believe she would tell my mom that, like she was putting my mom on notice that my mom better not claim my dads portion of the estate and threatening to put my mom through legal trouble and stress (due to increased legal fees my mom would have to pay) in order to make sure her husband(my brother) would get his inheritance that she feels she would benefit from. The fact that she did this after I sought her comfort and held her while I cried my dads ashes being stored in the niche and during the wedding when my dad was being remembered makes me so angry and I feel betrayed by her. \\n\\nShe has done other things following my dads death that irk me like not letting and or offering for my mom to be with my brother for a ceremony, and a total personality change after the marriage was legally finalized. However her comments to my mom about the distribution of my dads estate are particularly evil in my opinion. There is an understanding that my relatives on my dads side are not welcome to be anywhere near my dads estate due to their appalling behavior. I can argue that my brothers now wife has shown similar if not worse behavior. Therefore, I am considering banning her and her family as well as I am a trustee of the estate.\"\\n\\nSince this post was made,I have attended sessions with a marriage and family therapist with my brother and mom present. The therapist explained initially that there are separate \" family systems\" (nuclear family, in laws etc) and that when someone gets married there is tension due to the change in the family dynamic. Commonly mom or dad can get tempted to get involved in private issues of son or daughter's marriage. He says family need to respect the boundaries of each individual family system. When I told him \"well what about the sil? She didn't respect the boundaries of my family system(nobody gave her permission to ask about inheritance). The therapist then was stuck but I knew he agreed with my rebuttal but doing so aloud would overwhelm my brother so he told me to talk with my brother one on one. I did just that and asked my brother, \"do you believe what your wife did by telling our mom that an attorney told her that the kids get half of the estate is appropriate?\" He said I dont agree with the premise of your argument(what ever that was supposed to mean) and tried to justify her actions by saying she is not like that.\\n\\nI went to another session alone and the therapist(who saw my sil and my brother individually)said that my sil is extremely attached to her family of origin and is mainly concerned about doing things for their and my brothers benefit. When I asked him if it is reasonable to believe that she is concerned about the benefits my brother receive because she wants access to the family money and she is using her child to manipulate my mom for money and access to properties via free or reduced rents for her and her family of origin, he told me that based on his session with my sil and her past actions my suspicions are reasonable. He made it a point that my sil telling my mom that an attorney told her that the kids get half of the estate is inappropriate and there is no justification for it because she made a choice to say those things.\\nHe did try to tell me to be the \"bigger person\" and to use his observations to try to better understand where she is coming from(he said he believes my sil didnt do what she did because she hates me in particular, she just doesn't care about how I feel because she is primarily concerned about her family of origin and getting benefits for them)because if I don't i risk damaging my relationship with my brother and having him side with my sister in law and her family. I told him I cant control if that happens and will have to accept that he made that choice if he makes it.\\n\\nHe then told me to have a discussion about where my brothers stand on the situation because he feels I deserve to know straight from them, particularly the married  brother, whether they think what my sister in law did was inappropriate, my thoughts about her intentions are understandable and justified, and whether I have the assurance that my sil and her family will not be allowed to touch any family money or set foot in any commercial building that is family owned (having this assurance from both of them is important because therapist agreed with me that having sil and her family involved in my family's money and estate not ideal). The therapist told me that should I not get the assurance from my married brother, I am justified to take steps to keep her and her family away from the estate as my intentions he feels are based on protecting my dads legacy and the family money not trying to gain money unfairly for myself. Even thought my mom agrees with my stance on the situation, she objects to me talking to my brothers about where they stand. She told me if I did that my married  brother would ask her for money and it would cause her stress. I feel she could just tell him no. However I feel she is trying to protect my married brother because she feels his marriage would collapse and he wouldnt be able to deal with the financial and emotional stress of a divorce. On top of that I think the true opinions from two people whose opinion he finds credible(mom and therapist) about the situation would cause my married brother to breakdown mentally(my opinion I believe is being rationalized as \"irrational due to grief\" or \" sibling jealousy over marriage\" by my mom and brother to kick the can down the road so to speak) \\n\\nIs my sil justified to get involved in in laws inheritance because the inheritance would significantly impact her, her husband and her child life and her husband is a beneficiary of the inheritance(due to way my dad did things, inheritance ended up with my mom with me and my married brother trustees)?\\n\\nIs what my sil did inappropriate?\\n\\nIs what my mom doing(trying to prevent me from talking to my brothers about the situation) understandable? Is it justified for my mom to take actions to try to preserve a marriage that is not her own?\\n\\n\\n</td>\n",

He's a senior, and I understand that he needs space to become independent for collage, but it makes me really sad that he has become so distant. He never says hi to me at school, I ALWAYS say hi to him, he doesn't drive me to school anymore because he's driving his girlfriend, and he never does anything with me on the weekends. I've tried SO MANY TIMES, I have told him 20+ times that I want to spend more time with him, and I have asked him if he wants to do stuff with me etc. Eventually my parents tell him to spend more time with me so he does but it's only for a couple minutes. I don't know what to do, it feels like he already left for collage. I just want my brother back.</td>\n",

He makes a lot of verbal threats like \"I will hit you\" even when he is not showing any signs of being upset. Everyone keeps asking me what has changed at home, and to be honest nothing has. We (me and my boyfriend who has raised him since a few months old) are very calm and do not spank, and we have used many approaches to try to resolve this but right now I'm feeling a little burnt out, like nothing is helping him. His biological father had some mental health problems that I am worried may be passed on to my son, and I am feeling so guilty. I don't know where to go to get help or advice. I don't feel like this is out of control but I want to feel comfortable and confident in my parenting before it does become out of control. Thank you for any advice!</td>\n",

       "      <td>So I haven’t seen my dad or my step mother in over 6 months. \\n\\nLittle back story, they’re both alcoholics like I’m talking they’ve been slamming vodka every night since I was 8 years old, I’m 23 now. So my dad used to be a bit on the abusive side, sometimes physical but mostly emotionally/mentally. My step mom is a Russian psycho when you push her buttons or when she’s drinking she is a loose cannon. While her daughter is currently recovering from heroin addiction over the past 2 years I’d say. \\n\\nSo years have gone by since any of that. I’m an adult now and I’d never let anything happen and he’s seemingly changed a bit so I was ready and willing to build a better relationship. He is my father and I love and care for him dearly. \\n\\nSo, December they had told us they were getting us plane tickets to come visit them (my boyfriend and I, my step-sister was not able to make it due to being in rehab) in Florida we had thought. Then a couple weeks later my dad calls me and tells us he’s taking us to Turks &amp;amp; Caicos. An island they love and visit often. \\n\\nSo the trip starts off beautifully. We’re all laughing and smiling and getting along. It was great I really saw potential in everything. \\n\\nDay 3, that night as per usual they’re drinking (they just take straight shots of vodka throughout the night whereas they used to make mixed drinks with vodka and cranberry)\\nSo I’m complaining about my current job situation a little and my step mom starts to get defensive about my past mistakes with school and how they paid for one of my loans and basically starts throwing everything in my face saying I’m a fuck-up and they have me a great chance. I ended up running out of the house uncontrollably ugly sobbing (you know that cry where you literally can’t control it that it’s like all your emotions are just like OK NOW!)\\nI felt awful! Hurt and offended and embarrassed! Not only was she doing this on our “family vacation” but to top it off this was the first time they’re meeting my boyfriend. \\n\\nDay 4, I actually apologized to her firstly. Because towards the end of her lash out on me the night prior - I said something that i knew would hit her like a dagger, mostly only to shut her up because I was sick of hearing her insults. \\nSo I apologized first, was the bigger person, though I had no desire or care to be. In reality I really did it for my dad because I don’t really care about my relationship with my step-mom because in my honest opinion she’s a nasty cunt. \\n\\nDays go by, things are going well like nothing ever happened.\\n\\nDay 6, My boyfriend and I had a rough start to the morning. We got into a little tiff so we wanted to kind of keep to ourselves. Mind you we have spent every waking moment with my parents, beach during the day, we’d pack lunch then come back for dinner and watch movies all night. So our last day before we board the plane the next day, we wanted to take it easy and relax. We both weren’t in good moods so we weren’t trying to bug anyone else with our issues. We sat on the beach in the shade I read a book while he laid down. I ended up taking a nap in our room because I couldn’t sleep the night prior. It was like a 2 hour nap at best. My boyfriend this whole time had been sitting in the common room with my dad and step-mom watching some movie. So I wake up and my step moms walking around so I asked if the washer and dryer are free so we can do our laundry before we go back home. She had the balls to say to me “not all of us have the luxury of sleeping all day so no more laundry will be done today” first of all, what the fuck does one have to do with the other? Second of all, so because you want to be a big fat cunt, you’re going to make us go all the way home with dirty clothes in our luggage. Okay. \\n\\nThen, just as we’re about to get to bed and close the door, my step mom asks me to come sit and talk and I could her how drunk she was already. So I come out and before I even get the chance to sit down. She’s jumping down my throat. At this point my boyfriend comes out to make sure everything is alright. She jumps down his throat. Calling us “ungrateful,disgusting”said his “first impression was shit” that the next time was “family only” and if I’m being honest the only reason I was comfortable even going on vacation with them was because my boyfriend would be right by my side in case anything shitty happened (which it did). So my step mom and i are going back and forth. She’s Insulting myself and my boyfriend over and over. Because of this last day, because we weren’t having a good day and we ruined it for them because they didn’t enjoy seeing us “mope” as my dad casually stands next to her calling us disgusting and not having my back whatsoever. \\n\\nI was absolutely appalled. \\n\\nDidn’t talk to my dad for weeks after that,had no desire to. Until I finally tried to tell him how all that made me feel. Then he tries to blame other things and say he just wants the best for me that I’m “settling” because I got my boyfriend his dinner plates and do things for him. Jesus Christ like they have no idea how our relationship works. And if they had any issues. My father should’ve pulled me aside and privately talked to me about it! Because at this point why would my boyfriend ever want to see their faces again, and I’m jumping in that boat with him after all of that. Unless they quit drinking or something then I don’t know. \\n\\nIt’s just useless talking to my dad. He only disagrees with everything I say and they only see things the way that they want to see them. \\n\\nSuper long rant/story. But let me know, what would you do in this situation?\\n\\nI just don’t know how to feel anymore. \\n\\nAnd to add insult to injury, my blood brother hasn’t talked to my dad in over 7 years I’d say. That is a whole other story but like I’m at the point where I don’t want to cut him out of my life but like???? I can’t keep dealing with this. I just am so thankful I don’t ever have to live under his roof again</td>\n",

I have been overweight since I could remember and until recently I know why. My parents buy me fast food all the time and encourage bad eating habits. Theres always chips and soda in the house and hardly ever greens and healthier items. Whenever I ask for anything like veggies they say \"there so expensive for what you get\". And they dont enjoy cooking at home. I cook for them most of the time so I can avoid going to fast food.. Whenever I bring up that I dont want to eat at fast food all the time they tell me \"It costs so much more to eat at home\" and \"we dont have time\" \\n\\nLately I've been trying to lose weight and have been eating healthier but dinner is always a problem, or if I go anywhere with my mom. For breakfast and lunch I make the healthiest meals I can put together for myself, but for dinner, my parents always put fast food on the table at least 3 times a week. Whenever I go out with my mom she says, I'm hungry (we were just at home where she could have made a sandwich) and she gets 2 double cheeseburgers and a dr pepper from McDonald's(which is like 800 calories for a \"snack\"). \\n\\nI need a way to get them to stop eating out so much without pissing them off since everything I try to tell them that they have a problem they get mad at me.   \n",

                       My parents are good people but I feel so much pressure to make them proud that I’d rather just change my name and ghost them just so I can stop thinking about what they think of

None of this feels worth the stress and effort.   \n",

              Hi, first post and new here. Apologies if this is too long but I need to get this off my chest.\\n\\nI've never got along with my sister, (I'm 24 she's 32) she always treated me like I was a hassle and never had a nice thing to say about me. I feel so isolated because the stories she tells people make me not want to show my face, people know her more so of course they'll believe her over me, she even spread crap to my (already unbearable) Jobcentre work coach.\\n\\nNOTE: I'm struggling to move out because no landlord will have a UC claimant and the DWP are taking 1/3 of my living allowance. I am in touch with housing charities and I am trying to get help. I cant work due to extreme anxiety to the point of frequent dizzy spells, severe migraines, nausea and sometimes even passing out completely.\\n\\n9 months ago I had to leave my flat (for reasons that made me suicidal, not the first time I've been that way) and had to move in with her and her family. I had a long phase where every waking moment was so painful i struggled to breathe. I told her a few thoughts and she responded with \"I always knew you weren't strong enough\". I few days later I overdosed my medication, she found me and had me rushed to A&amp;E, I was in overnight having blood tests and my heart monitored (no lasting effects) the next day she visited and complained how my attempt stopped her from making some kid's birthday cake she promised she'd do. I felt safe at the hospital, the NHS staff were so lovely, when I got back I slowly started to improve (thanks to my wonderful nieces who took it upon themselves to mend my broken heart) and I was determined to help where I could.\\n\\nI cared for ALL the animals, and the kids. I'd happily cook for everyone too, I was happy for a while, but my sister started to get more and more upset with me because of how I cared for her children: mending soft toys, clipping and cleaning scraggly nails, nit treatment and combing, teeth brushing routines and regularly cleaned clothes and bedding (I worship those kids). She tells them she'll help them but shouts if they ask, if I do something for them she says in their faces \"Am I not capable? Ey?\" and storms off. She bit my head off for getting them fed, cleaned and ready for bed while she slept (from 3:45pm - 9pm, past kids bedtime).\\n\\nNext morning she sat next to me on the sofa, looked me in the face with an expression that could kill and says \"You make me feel like such a lousy mother\" and again, storms off.\\n\\nMy sister lives in a pigsty and expects me to clean up after her, she tells me \"compromise goes both ways\" and I'm being lazy, antisocial and a general leech, I do nothing to help myself (apparently). I have decided to be ENTIRELY independent and only care for my own (me and my pets). She and her partner want me to do even more since she got herself pregnant (another one she cant look after). She wants to be with me for the good things but when I need support she shuts me down, she gets extremely stroppy if she doesn't know everything I'm up to, If I don't tell her it means I'm on youtube or playing Skyrim 24/7 making no attempt to better my situation.\\n\\nI feel defenceless around her, she has a very entitled know-it-all attitude that I cant stand. She tells me she hates the way I live (she must mean hygienically, and debt-free with great care for my animals, we've always been opposites)\\n\\nShe's determined she's right but it doesn't feel right to me. What are your thoughts? Am I wrong for keeping out of her way and making sure I only provide for myself and my pets?\\n\\nSorry for my horrible ranty post, my head is a mess, I'm trying my best.\\n\\nThank you   \n",

crying, feeling extremly angry and hurt. **For reference, I am the oldest (31F). My younger sister (29F) is getting married at the end of August. My brother (27M)  is having a “His and Her” baby shower with his girlfriend this weekend. I am at my parent’s house, where I grew up, currently, hoping to spend the week here leading up to the baby shower this weekend.**\\n\\nMy mother is self-absorbed. She doesn't care that my sister Katie and I were molested by my cousin Nick as a child and that I was treated like shit by my other cousin Ana (his sister) throughout my childhood and caught up in a hurtful, dysfunctional relationship with her as an adult (which ended with y cutting contact completely). My mom is more concerned with keeping “the family together” than acknowledging the damage that was done to me as a child and how it has affected me and continues to affect me as an adult. She is afraid. She is a coward. She is afraid of looking bad. She is afraid of any confrontation even if the outcome would be good for her kids. She makes up stories in her head and believes them and is afraid and paranoid. She was not an active mother to me as a child. But I did love her. She had a very happy and warm energy, and still does.  She was loving and comforting when it was convenient to her. She treated me like an inconvenience. I hated being alive. I hated who I was as a kid. I hate her. I don’t want to be around her or hear her stupid stories. I want to be away from it all.\\n\\nAccording to her, “it’s a good thing Mike (Katie’s fiance) wasn’t able to come to the baby shower because if Nick happens to be there, Mike would be really upset.” What the fuck about ME and KATIE? It doesn’t cross your mind that WE would be upset? How about last summer, when I finally told you about all of this,  and you PROMISED me that I would never ever have to worry about seeing him ever again. She would talk to Aunt Terri and Uncle Paul. She would talk to Kip, my brother,  so that he knows what’s going on. Now that has completely gone out the window. Because she is TOO FUCKING AFRAID. She doesn’t give a fuck about how I feel. It’s about everyone else and her. How SHE will look. How SHE doesn’t want to start conflict in her family. FUCK that bullshit, I want out. I am getting out. After this stupid fucking wedding I will not be around her again. I am only doing this wedding for my sister because it matters to her and I love her. I cannot stand my mother. I want to leave now but at the same time I want to push through and be at the baby shower for my brother. He wouldn’t be hurt or angry if I wasn’t there though. It’s all a fake story that I have in my mind because of my mom. I love him and he loves me but he won’t be heartbroken that I’m not there. It’s a fucking 3 hour party. \\n\\nBut I am an adult. I don’t need to be protected by her. She can do what the hell she wants with the knowledge of what happened to me. She can ignore it and have fake relationship with my aunt and cousins, just how she likes it. I won’t do it and I won’t put up with being around her while she continues to do it. \\n\\nTldr; my mother is ignoring the fact that I was molested as a kid by my cousin, for her own convenience of not having to exclude family members from upcoming family events.   \n",

I have told my husband, my toddler, my boss, and a very close friend, but can't bring myself anyone else that I am pregnant and I don't feel excited about sharing the news with my family, friends, or coworkers. I don't feel excited about a social media post either. Anyone feel this way also?   \n",

She thinks she’s the one who get less support in general. \\nFrom my point of view, she has everything she wanted since she’s small. I usually don’t care much about how much she’s getting, the only thing that gets on my nerve is she’d binge shopping online and throw away all the cloths that she doesn’t like. She’d buy all the brand cosmetics that costs tons. VIP cards holder of the brandy cosmetic stores. \\n\\nLately I’ve been talking about visiting a friend in another country. She made a big fuzz about it. That it is unfair I’ll be spending money going on a trip whilst I haven’t started to work. I have been working hard in school and yes I am fortunate to have family helping me out. I appreciate it. \\nI’m usually a minimalist that I watch out on my spending because I’m still financially relying on my parents until this upcoming summer. Most of the days I don’t spend money. My parents would tell me its ok to spend money sometimes. \\n\\nI got annoyed because I think she can’t see how much she’s getting but she only sees how much she’s NOT getting. Every time I point out the fact how she can’t put us onto a scale, she’ll get mad and being mean to the whole family, whining how she’s being mistreated. \\nMy parents would go crazy when this topic comes up. They’d be furious and accusing us not appreciating their help. \\n\\nIt is frustrating for me to even talk about my plans. Whenever it comes to anything that would lead to spending money/ better life style, people react differently. \\n\\nI think its a norm that people who own the most complain about how little they are getting, or they are prone to compare themselves with other people. \\n\\nAnyone has similar experiences?   \n",
       "7    Growing up was hard. My twin sister and I lived with our mum. We lived in over 25 houses in the first 16 years of our lives. One particular year, we moved 4 times. The time came when we knew we would be moving again soon. The knocks on the front door would become more frequent. The hiding in our rooms or under our beds would become more frequent. The inability to answer the house phone would become more frequent. The isolation from mum's \"new close friends\" would begin.\\n\\nWe would start packing up our belongings and saw it is as a competition to see how quickly we could complete this. We became experts, eventually being able to pack and unpack a house in a day. We would put the radio on and sing and dance to music as a way to distract ourselves while packing. It stopped us from dwelling on the fact that we were moving again. It stopped us from thinking about 'why': mum had once again failed to pay the rent and the bills. She owed people money (her new friends, the landlords, her colleagues, her clients, or even our elderly neighbours).\\n\\nHer lies had caught up with her again and she could no longer hide behind them. She had exhausted all her favours. She had exhausted the people's goodwill and they were starting to see the truth. That she had lied and manipulated them. That she had used her children and the fact that she was a single parent as a reason for them to feel sorry for her and to give her the benefit of the doubt. To let her have longer to pay them. To trust or have faith that she would come up with the money. Eventually they all came to the same conclusions. They realised that they needed to cut their losses and find a more reliable tenant. That her promises were empty. That they couldn't help us even if they had tried.\\n\\nThis process continued. Over and over. Mum worked as a carer with elderly first and then the disabled. She worked as a cleaner sometimes too. She had an infectious and bubbly personality. She could make fast friends so easily. Internally and behind closed doors, I look back and can see a lady who was deeply depressed. She would often spend days in bed. She had high levels of anxiety from all the lies she was living with. She was constantly trying to function at a heightened level to keep ahead of her lies. It got to a point where I'm not even sure she knew the difference between the lie she had created and the truth. She was a master manipulator. This was one of her biggest assets in a way, as it allowed her to continue to exploit people to feed her problem. She did this for so many years and never truly suffered the consequences of her actions.\\n\\nWe knew mum had a problem from the age of 7. We heard whispers from our family friends. That she was addicted to gambling. The pokies specifically. My sister and I were left to our own devices from that age. We would often be at home alone. Wondering what to eat. How to get it ready. When to go to school. If she would be home to take us or if we needed to find our own way there. If she would be there to pick us up or if we needed to find our way home. This became our life.\\n\\nWe were independent from a young age, not able to rely on mum to organise things for us. We worried about her of course, as any child would. When she was gone for long periods, we thought the worst.\\n\\nHad something happened to her?\\n\\nHad she crashed her car?\\n\\nHad she been arrested?\\n\\nShe always had excuses about where she was. She had been at work. She had to stay later and longer. She was working hard to earn money to pay rent. Her car had broken down. She was helping a friend. She took someone to the hospital. The list continued.\\n\\nIn the end, we would hop on our bikes and ride from pub to pub. If we found mum's car at least we would know where she was and not have to worry. We would walk the streets late at night. We would climb on the roof and look into the distance, hoping to see her coming home. We didn't advertise to anyone what our home life was like. Our diet included two-minute noodles, macaroni and cheese, toast, and milo.\\n\\nSometimes on pay day, mum would do a shop and we would have food for awhile. Then it would slowly dwindle and we would go back to the basics. This has definitely impacted my diet to this day. Food has always been the lowest priority. We were used to going without.\\n\\nMum was on the wrong side of the law a few times over different periods growing up. From when we were 8, mum had some friends who could make money growing cannabis in their sheds and cupboards. The allure of money won mum over. Even though we were renting, her and her friends set up shop in the garden shed. They converted it into a hydroponic set up with the fluorescent lights and black lining over the walls. We didn't think too much of it. We knew it was illegal but after the first few crops and an influx of money, mum seemed happier. We had more food than we'd had in awhile. We didn't move house when the month came to the end so it seemed like there were more positives at the time.\\n\\nThe problem with this was that mum still had her underlying addiction. Often, she would receive the influx of cash and spend bigger at the pokies for longer. In the end, it only fuelled her problem to some degree. We continued to move house. The garden sheds got a little bigger and the crops got a little larger. We came home one day to find the crops were ready to dry out. The whole house smelt. Mum was sitting on the floor in the rumpus room with newspaper and scissors. She was cutting the cannabis. We sat down and helped her. I think we were 8.\\n\\nReflecting back on this with my sister, we laughed. We laughed at many things. We laughed at how we used to make a game of remembering the names of the streets we'd lived in and what order they were in from when we were born until now. We laughed at cutting cannabis with mum when we were 8. We laughed at the police and debt collectors who knocked on our doors repetitively over the years. We laughed at how mum had told them she was our aunty a couple of times and got away with it. We laughed at how mum used to change her last name. For bills, for jobs, for house applications. We couldn't keep up.\\n\\nWas it Harvey or Watts or Nitsche?\\n\\nWe weren't sure. It allowed her to get away with things for longer.\\n\\nLaughing, it seems, is one of our many coping mechanisms. In a way, we have compartmentalised this part of our life and locked it away. By not talking about it, we haven't really dealt with our feelings and we were both afraid of the impact of this on us now and later. This is why we have decided to share our stories.\\n\\nMum was the ultimate fraudster. She was given charge of our local soccer club finances one year. I think they figured she used to work in a bank so she was good with sums. They weren't to know she had an addiction and shouldn't be trusted. Mum used her knowledge of banks to then spend all of our soccer club's money. She got passed the need for two signatures and withdrew that money. I will never know how she got away with that and how no one pressed charges. The club folded soon after.\\n\\nAnother brush with the law came when mum was housesitting a work colleague's house. Unbeknownst to us, while her work colleague was overseas, she began pawning off her belongings. Jewellery, sporting equipment, electronics and the list goes on. This showed a desperate but opportunistic woman. Of course, her friend returned from overseas. She quickly realised her stuff was gone. She went to the police and this was mum's most serious encounter with the law. I remember she had to get lawyers. She went to court. The investigation and process dragged on for months. Mum was stressed and depressed. She asked our grandma to help her. Grandma gave her money. She paid for the lawyers. She bailed her out of another problem. She didn’t want us to be without mum. She didn’t want mum to have a criminal record. If only grandma could understand that she wasn't doing her any favours. Mum continued to gamble. She continued to lie. She continued to owe people money. I sometimes wish Grandma had let mum suffer the consequences of her actions back then. Maybe she could have been helped. We will never know.\\n\\nIn our minds, as my sister and I became more aware of what was going on, we decided we just needed to get through school. We wanted to be better. We wanted to do better. We needed to get away from this life we were living. We had aspirations and somehow, despite our role models, we knew right from wrong. We despised lies. We despised debt. We tolerated our mum but we didn't like what she had become or how she treated people. It got to the point where we didn't believe a single word out of her mouth. Everything seemed to be a lie. Even if she was just talking about her day, about a conversation she had with someone. Nothing could be taken as the truth anymore.\\n\\nMy sister and I threw ourselves into our schooling and our sport. Those were our outlets. Those got us through. The times continued to be tough. We held on to the thought that if we aimed high, we could eventually walk away from all this. We had each other. We inspired each other and we always felt so lucky to be twins. It was a blessing that there were two of us to support each other whilst we struggled through this life together.\\n\\nMum started to unravel at times when her guilt and desperation reached heightened levels. She would take her stress and anger out on us. She manipulated us into feeling like a burden. Like all her money problems were because of us. She would be irrational. She would search our rooms for money. We would have to hide. We were scared when she was in these states. We would sometimes roam the streets until she calmed down.\\n\\nWe kept our lives a secret. No one knew. Not our teachers. Not our friends. We were embarrassed and in a way, we felt guilty. We had lied. We had lied to many people. It had become second nature. We put up a facade in order to get the next house.\\n\\nIn order to keep mum out of trouble.\\n\\nWe didn't want her to go to jail and where would we live?\\n\\nWe weren't innocent.\\n\\nWe contributed to people being hurt.\\n\\nTo people being deceived and manipulated.\\n\\nIt was wrong but we felt trapped.\\n\\nWhere else could we have gone?\\n\\nI don't regret many things in life but I do regret this. We were selfish. We were in self-preservation mode. We went along with the lies, which was wrong. Many people were affected by our mum's actions. Too many to name. They lost money. They had their trust broken. They even lost belongings that she sold or pawned. Some people were so vulnerable that they had no chance to even say no. The elderly, the disabled, and even her own family.\\n\\nThe last straw came many years later. Our grandma was progressing with her dementia. As the grandchildren, we didn't want to get too involved with grandma's finances. It's usually the parents who take care of these matters when they arise. Our grandma had one daughter and one son. Her son, on our recommendation, had placed grandma's money in a fixed term deposit account, not attached to her normal bank account. We had thought this would be enough to stop mum from accessing the bulk of grandma's money. But we were wrong.\\n\\nMum had gotten around that and taken grandma into the bank. She got her to sign a form to put the money in her normal account and had been withdrawing that money slowly but surely over a few months. Our uncle found this out when he came over from Tasmania for a holiday. He exposed the ugly truth. That mum could sink so low that she would exploit her own family. Her mother who had helped her time and time again over the years. Her mother who had dementia and was so trusting of her. She prayed on the most vulnerable. Grandma had always believed that mum could get better. That she deserved second chances.\\n\\nWe were all angry. At mum and at ourselves. We should have known mum wouldn't stop. That no one was off limits to her addiction and her lies. Since that day, we haven't seen or spoken to mum.\\n\\nMy sister and I took over caring for our grandma. We love her dearly. She is now in a nursing home. Mum doesn't know where she is. She has never visited her. Grandma asks about her most days. She knows what she did and it hurts her to think of what her daughter has become. For me, I feel better not having mum in my life. It's definitely easier. I don't have to worry what is coming next. I don't have to worry about answering my phone. I don't have to worry about debt collectors or friends chasing money from her.\\n\\nThe sad thing is that we don't know where mum is. We wouldn't know if she is dead or alive and that haunts me in my dreams.   \n",

person when I am hanging with friends, with my girlfriend, hanging out with girlfriends parents, at work, etc. However, as soon as I come home I feel like my personality flips completely. Whenever my mom asks me questions I am very cold and short with her and look forward to the conversation ending. My step dad I don't like at all because he is mopey drunk with OCD, and act's like a nice guy in order to get what he wants from my mom which never works so he just pouts around the house. My mother is really nice and always try's to do stuff for me and I just act like a complete dick to her for no reason. She drinks her fair share too and I hate drunk people in general so I avoid them both all together when they drink.\\n\\nMy problem is that even when they are not drinking I always feel awkward to be nice to them and smile around them. I beat myself up over it because I know one day my mom will not be around any more and I will just be left with regret that I didn't even try to have a good relationship. My mom is constantly asking me if everything is alright and it always starts an argument when I snap at her and say that I am fine. I talked to my sister about this today and she said that I'm even cold with her and that I just need to get over it and try.   \n",

Tldr at the bottom.\\n\\nWithin the past year, I (21 f) have been slowly realizing that I don't think I have a good relationship with my mom.\\n\\nFor a while, I've just felt like I need to grow up or that we just have really different personalities and it's my fault I dont like to be around her. I was really excited to go to college so I didnt have to interact with her as often and, again, thought I might have just been overreacting or hormonal. I've always made excuses to not visit her since then. I usually dont text her first and when I do it's because I feel guilty for not having interacted with her for a few days, not because I really want to. Sometimes when she texts me I dont even respond for a whole day. I can't quite put my finger on why I feel like this but I recently realized something that might help me put the puzzle together.\\n\\nFor years my mom and my dads mom have had beef. I'm pretty sure this was an ordeal even before I was born. I didn't really realize it was happening until I was about 15. My mom started talking mad shit about her around that time but it was never really specific. I have personally witnessed my dads mom say some shady things and so having only my own mothers side of the story I naturally sided with her. \\n\\nMy mom and dad did not have a happy marriage for very long. I remember from a very young age that they had some issues. But that's a whole 'nother can of worms to step in. I was in my mid teens when my mom started to \"open up\"  about her and my dads relationship. My dad never really talked to me (I daresay he was emotionally neglectful but again that's even another can of worms) so I never really got his side of the story. My mom just said some absolutely terrible things about my dad then when she was done ranting she would say something nice about him. Hindsight it just seems like she was afraid I would say something to him so she was just trying to cover her steps but idk. The point is she got me to take her side.\\n\\nThey finally got divorced last year and my dad has been very honest with me about the whole thing. He is telling me what my mom did wrong just like my mom always (always...) tells me what he did wrong. But what he does that's different than my mom is understand his own role in the failed marriage. He knows exactly where he went wrong and he is really trying to change for the better. And him opening up to me like that made me realize just how much my mom lied to me and manipulated me to hate my dad. \\n\\nThroughout my childhood she always threw shade at my friends and their families which has ultimately ruined multiple friendships, so like... more than one. Like I'm just realizing this as I'm writing this but she rarely had anything good to say about any of my friends and their families. I feel like a total asshole having taken her side so often. Again, I thought I had done something wrong but...\\n\\nI'm finally a semi functional person with somewhat coherent thoughts and I guess I'm just starting to notice a pattern. I keep my distance from my mom because she makes me uncomfortable. My mom has always thrown mad shade at my dad and his mom. My dad opening up to me realized that my mom was telling me lies about him and it just makes me wonder what she was lying about my grandmother (dads mom) and my friends. Or what kinds of lies shes saying about me to her friends. She always made me believe she had a good relationship with me but I'm certainly questioning that now.\\n\\nIdk, maybe I'm overthinking this or reading this situation wrong but it feels good to get this off my chest at least. \\n\\nTldr: my mom has said some really terrible things about a lot of the people in my life and I have always taken her side and I'm just now realizing why I don't like being around her.   \n",

                                        I had a great family, Mum, Dad, my Brother &amp; of course myself.  I genuinely feel as though I was blessed to have the best family ever.  I could never put into words the wonderful life my parents gave me.\\n\\nJust as I turned 30, my brother was taken from us in a car accident (he was 26).  He was a passenger in a car on the way back from a work meeting, and another car crashed head on into the car my brother was in.  My brother, and all in the car he was in were innocent.  My family never recovered from the loss of my brother.  I lost my partner as I was never the same again.  Then my dad died of heartbreak, loosing a son can do that, I watched it with my own eyes, people can die from heartbreak.\\n\\nChristmas went from 6 of us, Mum, Dad, My Brother, his partner, Myself and my partner - down to two of us, just myself and Mum left.\\n\\nMy Mum lived at my brothers home for a few years after he was killed in the car crash.  It was her way of coping.My family and life was ruined by the loss of my Brother.\\n\\nBut there are also so many knock on effects from an event like what happened.  My Brothers cat for years after he was killed (my Brother) always made sure he (the Cat) was at my brothers home, pining for where my Brother was on my Brothers birthday.  There was no doubt my Brothers cat knew that was a special day - as there were celebrations at my Brothers home that day in the past, and the cat knew it was a special day.  He (the cat) would have wondered what happened to my Brother.  My Brothers cat, and this is so sad to me, probably thought that my Brother deserted him (the Cat).  But the Cat held hope years after.  But it brings tears to my eyes for hours, because we could not communicate to the poor Cat that he was not deserted by his beloved owner, but that his owner was stolen from him, and all of us.\\n\\nAnd that is so so sad.  That beautiful and loyal animal had to suffer thinking his beloved owner deserted him.\\n\\nNo matter what, this is sad - and I feel the pain for that poor little cat....   \n",

                                                               My mother passed away not too long ago, and we were super close. Now it feels like there is a gaping hole in my heart where she was. She was my only parent, we have a small family, I have no siblings, and we moved a lot so no longterm friendships either. My entire life has just been the two of us. We had a lot in common and were best friends. She said she loved me more than any other person in the entire world, and I felt the same about her. I didn't want to get married or have kids one day. I just wanted to live with her for the rest of my life, and she was more than happy with the idea of me never moving out. We were like soulmates/soultwins/twinflames (whatever you want to call it) on a spiritual and emotional level level. Loving only one person intensely is the only way I really know how to love. I can't comprehend within myself how people are able to greatly love multiple people- siblings, two parents, in-laws, etc. But in order to move forward and find love again- I know I will likely have to learn to love this way. But I honestly don't know how. I try to imagine/fantasize myself one day with a child, a daughter/son-in-law, and having grandkids to dote on. It might sound silly?? but I can't picture it and there is a lot of internal conflict and even heartbreak when I think about it. And it's also hard to know that I will likely never have someone again that loves me with such intensity as my mom, and only me. I'm at a loss and don't know how to move forward in life. Loving one person intensely- and being loved back with that same intensity- is the only way I know how to love.   \n",

She was always my favorite sibling, and I'm pretty sure she wants very little to do with me anymore. Does anyone have some advice for not letting these thoughts of anger and heartbreak control my actions and my words? I still love her, but I just don't know what to do right now. I feel hopeless that there is any way that me and her can repair our bond, and at this point some part of me doesn't want to. A very small part of me wants to just hate her, and the rest of me is so sick of fighting that part of my mind. I haven't been getting much sleep since me and her went our separate ways, and now I'm just mentally exhausted and want a way to numb the way I'm feeling. I haven't smiled in days, haven't ever felt like this specifically. I just think that nobody wants me anymore. My mother tells me she's doing me a huge favor by letting me stay in her house and not to expect anything else from her whatsoever. My bridges are burnt, and I'm left with only bad roads to follow. My one chance for salvation, is join the military, something I really am not about. I'm so sick of trying my best to be a mostly sober, person who is semi cooperative, and doesn't get in legal trouble. I give up. I can't keep lying to myself, I'm not happy, so I'm not gonna kid myself anymore. A part of me hates someone I hated the though of losing or even moving far away from, and now I'm on an opposite page. I never would've thought I'd feel like this, and it really kills me. A part of me wants to die, and the side that doesn't wanna give up wants to fuck up. There's only a shred of hope inside of me that I can make something of myself anymore. I fucked my life up, and now I'm back in this fucking house that I never wanted to come back to. I'm pretty fucking over it already, and I wish I a fucking car would just hit me when I least expect it already. I just want the fucking sadness to go away.   \n",

                                                               My father has been hospitalised and got into a critical condition today, so I was advised by my mother and brother to return home to see him alive for the very last time. I know it is a common sense to be there for our family's last moments, but I had to ask the reason because I would not even be able to converse with my father anymore. They said it is the best for me, not for anyone else. Let's put it aside how they know what would be the best for me especially when it comes to my personal feelings. \\n\\nSo I thought I might as well return home to see him alive again because I also know I am terrible at acting according to common sense. I assumed it would be the best go follow social norms especially this is about my family, not myself. \\n\\nPreviously to the above event, I applied for a job and was going to attend the interview. It is a job I have been searching for over a few months. I had to email them whether they can contact me via email since I would not be able to receive calls overseas, only to find they will start interviewing tomorrow and the successful candidate will start on Monday. \\n\\nI can hardly explain how furious I am. As much as I want credit for doing the right thing for my family, I want my family to know this is ruining my life and I am doing myself wrong because of this.\\n\\nCould anyone help convince me that flying back to Japan from Australia just to watch my father slowly move on would be beneficial to my life? How would I make it feel worthy? I barely wish to be able to love my family but I would at least like to eliminate my negative feelings towards them.   \n",

  We just had our first child three weeks ago. She is the first grandchild on both sides. My mom has made it clear she would like to see her grandchild 3-4x a week even though she will be watching her full time when I go back to work at 4 months (starting to question her watching her now...).\\n\\nMy family calls and texts constantly. My mom wants to FaceTime during diaper changes and feedings (I breastfeed) and will call and text constantly until I answer if I don’t pick up right away. Really hard with a newborn to constantly be texting...\\n\\nLast week kind of set me over the top. My family knows I have been extremely worried about germs with a newborn. My sister and mom came over last Wednesday. When my sister got here, her nose was runny and her voice was basically gone. I asked about 10 times if she was sick and she assured me she had bad allergies. The next day she threw up at 9 AM. No one decided to tell me this. My family still was planning to get together Friday.. they only canceled after she was still throwing up early Friday morning.. meaning they were going to get together knowing my sister was sick until she spent 2 days puking. \\n\\nI told my parents that since they have spent a lot of time with my sister and have been exposed I’d like to wait a week or so before getting together. My mom calls constantly crying, and begging to come see our baby. She said she’d wear a mask and gloves.. I am constantly trying to nicely tell her I’m just concerned exposing our new baby to germs. After finally getting my mother to agree that she could wait a week to see the baby- she tells me she’s also had diarrhea but it was likely something she ate. Clearly my family has been sick and they are writing it off because they want to see the baby. They have been extremely overbearing and stressing me out. \\n\\nAny advice? I don’t know how to handle this.   \n",

There's quite a bit to it in terms of my relationship with my dad..\\n\\nI come from an Asian family and for some reason this sometimes means we just never communicate about our emotions. My dad unfortunately lost his job due to a fire and he's been doing manual labour type jobs his whole life. He loves it but obviously it has taken a huge toll on his physical health. He's generally ok but has a lot of pain in his legs and back because of his jobs but also because of various health issues. This is important to mention because he just refuses to do anything active like going for a run or a walk if the weather is nice just to kill time.\\n\\nI feel bad for him that he's now been sitting at home for a couple of weeks seeming really bored. I would like to add he IS actively looking for jobs but not getting  anywhere because of his lack of qualifications. He occasionally goes out with his friends but obviously they all work so that's hard to do. I don't want to continue to watch him like this but equally I don't know how to talk to him about it in fear he'll think I'm just taking pity on him (this is where the whole Asian family type stuff comes in).\\n\\nWhat do you guys think I could do with my Dad to help him actually live life a little? I'm a 22 yr old female btw, currently have all the time in the world as I just graduated and don't start my Master's programme until September, so I have time to help him out.\\n\\nI hope you guys can help, thank you so much if you've read this.   \n",

I'm really hoping someone might be able to give me some helpful advice on this. My older brother is 37 years old, and has been dealing with depression since his very early teens. He has been on medication this entire time, different ones prescribed by different doctors. He sees a therapist regularly. He meditates daily. Some days he's okay, and can laugh every now and then. But most of time he just seems miserable and emotionless.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTo give a better perspective on our family dynamic, here's an overly long paragraph about us:\\n\\nMy parents separated when I was 6 (brother was 9). It wasn't a super messy split, but my dad refused to pay child support for quite a long time, and my mom ended up having to use all of her savings on court/lawyers fees to try and get him to pay. We lived with my mom (she struggled to get by for years), and saw my dad every other weekend. My dad's entire life has always revolved around soccer. He lives and breathes it. Most of my childhood was spent at the soccer field: my mom played it, I played it, my brother played it for a couple years, and my dad coached women's soccer teams, took teams to tournaments and ran the leagues in our city. To this day, a conversation with my dad would include a lengthy chat about soccer. I know he definitely chose soccer over visiting with us numerous times.\\n\\nIn all honesty, I don't really remember my childhood being that bad, I still felt loved by both my parents. But my brother seems to think differently. He has a very heavy dislike (hatred?) towards my dad. And my mom too, but mostly my dad.\\n\\nGrowing up, my brother always did really well in school. He's the smart one in the family, and has always has good jobs. He's had to loan my mom money several times in his life. I think he resents her for not being able to take care of us \"properly\".\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOur family has also never been one to go out of our way to communicate with each other. We don't have any deep conversations about feelings, and we never have. My mom and I are very close, and I'm also quite close to my dad. My brother feels like an outcast. I recently found this out when him and I had a little drunk heart-to-heart outside of a wedding celebration. He thinks he's not like us, and he feels like he doesn't belong when our extended family gets together. (My mom lives in a separate building on the same property as my aunt/uncle, so by extended family I mean mom/brother/me/aunt/uncle/cousins).\\n\\nWhen we're together, he's usually pretty quiet, although if he's in an okay mood he's very funny and can laugh and be sarcastic with the rest of us. He really is a lot of fun when he's at his best. It's rare though.\\n\\nA lot of the time he's sarcastic, I'd say almost to a hurtful extent. I've dealt with it my entire life, so I take people's insults as jokes. I've always laughed off comments that my brother made to me, even if they were true. I think my dad did the same. My mom takes my brother's comments to heart.\\n\\nI've been paying attention more recently to how he acts around me compared to how he acts around my parents. I moved in with him a few months ago (temporary job), and have noticed that for the most part, he can laugh and joke with me. I make stupid comments and he laughs, it's quite fun. When we're around our parents, he is very different. This is when he'll be quiet, moody, barely smile. He'll make little jabs at my mom (like I said, she takes them to heart, I can see the hurt in her eyes when he says them), and if he's around my dad it's so much worse. He endlessly (somewhat subtly) tells my dad that he's a shitty person. He makes so many snide remarks towards him, being completely serious, but my dad tends to laugh them off (I guess I learned this from him).\\n\\nMy dad is a hoarder, by the way. Not like the garbage everywhere kind, but he keeps everything. He has rooms piled with things (a lot of soccer stuff), and he doesn't clean the house or take care of himself. I know that he's recently gone a month without showering. He's also slowing down in his age (71), so I'm worried about him.\\n\\nI think the hoarding that my dad is doing has created an even bigger divide between my dad and brother. My dad makes no effort to call/text/keep in touch with my brother. My brother barely makes an attempt at talking to my dad. Every now and then my brother will call him when he's waiting to board a plane (because he knows he'll have to hang up in a certain amount of time).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI've frequently googled how to help a depressed friend or family member, and all I get are the same results. \"Tell them you're there to listen, encourage them to get help, tell them it gets better\". I've told him I'm here to listen, he doesn't want to talk to me. He's been seeing a therapist for many years now, and has taken countless medications. He's been depressed since he was about 14, and it hasn't gotten any better for him.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHe's still alone. He's had a girlfriend every now and then but nothing for more than a year or so. He's never been married. I know he wants to get married, I know he'd even like to have a kid one day. I think this gets to him a lot that he's still single.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt makes me so incredibly sad to see him like this, and I don't know how to help him. He truly is a great guy, and he deserves to find happiness and enjoyment in his life.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAny advice to approach this would be greatly appreciated.   \n",

constantly complains about her weight, 125lbs and 5’7”, basically dream bod. She goes to the gym 6 days a week, hardly eats and when she does it’s like salad or crackers, I’m honestly hungry for her. She compares herself to me (27F) all the time even though I tell her I have a solid 15 lbs on her and she just says it’s muscle—literally the gym addict says this to the couch potato. I tell her to not call herself fat it’s a horrible habit and unhealthy, but she ignores me. I’m not offended because I am fine with my body, my little sister (21F) however has lower self esteem and if she heard my mother with a bangin body calling herself fat she would feel terrible about herself. I used to feel bad and worry about my mom, but it’s gone on for so long and the risk of hurting my little sister or any woman/girl is so high it’s to the point it angers me. What do I do??   \n",

                                                                                                So, some background info:\\nMy parents don’t have a great marriage, and never did. It’s always been borderline emotionally abusive, sometimes physical (my mom has thrown things at my dad and has hit him). \\nA couple years ago my dad almost died because of diabetes and is now disabled. As of now he’s prescribed oxy for the pain, and has been on it for 2 years. However, he is abusing it, and snorts it, passes out and drools on himself, etc. He has also started drinking again, at first it was just a couple glasses of wine, and now we have to hide any beer we have in the house. He’s an alcoholic, addicted to oxy, on the couch literally 24/7, and isn’t the nicest person. \\nMy mother isn’t the nicest either, I feel that she can be pretty selfish a lot of the time. For example, she hasn’t done her taxes in 2 years, gets mad when I ask her to, and I haven’t been able to apply for FAFSA. I’m always scared to say anything not positive about her behavior because she gets mad, yells at me, and insults me, usually calling me a drama queen and telling me to get over it. Because of my dad’s disability, bills are a little harder to pay because he’s not working anymore, and my mom isn’t working either. \\nI am currently going to school for social work, and a lot of the time my mom comes to me with her issues because I have the right responses. However, I don’t want to be her therapist. She will talk to me about very personal problems, sometimes even bringing up her and my father’s sex life. A few months ago she had a mental breakdown, and our house was almost in foreclosure. I was the only one in the family who knew about this besides my mom, my brother and sister had no idea. She comes to me with these issues of money, running through all of their savings, 401K, etc. She talks to me about leaving him, moving away, and needing to “put herself first for once.” She also complains about how my dad is basically just killing himself, as he also had collapsed lungs and is smoking cigarettes a lot. But my mom also smokes, and I brought up how she shouldn’t smoke either because if she ends up in the hospital like my father did, I’ll have to deal with it all, as my siblings will most definitely not be helpful. When I said this she just brushed it off and said something along the lines of “I know, your father is useless and won’t help”\\n\\nHow do I tell my mom that this is an inappropriate relationship and it makes me super uncomfortable to be expected to act as her therapist? I try to distance myself but a lot of the time she just makes any conversation about this. Once we got in a fight and I tried to bring up how I don’t want to know about their issues, and she compared it to me having fights with my own boyfriend. I feel that going to your mother with relationship problems (and I never talk about sex or anything like that) is a totally different dynamic than what she is doing to me. \\nAm I in the wrong for not wanting to hear these issues from my mother?   \n",

I have ten month old little boy and his grandparents are super helpful if I ever need them to look after him for an appointment they're always more than happy to help. However, my partners dad is a drinker he has been coming over at 10am smelling of whiskey. He disappears like clockwork when he comes over either to get his coat out of the car (so he says) or upstairs to the toilet. I live a few doors down from a little shop and am friends with the ladies who work there and they confirmed he was coming in and buying small bottles of red wine and downing them at 11am. I have confronted him a few months ago as he was driving whilst drinking and I can't have him putting other road users at risk, his wife knows but cannot smell so he is very good at hiding it from her. My mother passed away three years ago from EXACTLY the same thing in exactly the same way which is why I had to speak out, it's giving me anxiety seeing him like it and not knowing how to approach it. Since speaking out, my partners father has gone to a few AA meetings but yesterday he came over smelling of whiskey and again today at 10am. He's lost a lot a weight and his wife told me she found blood on his bedsheets in the morning.  It's not my place to say to him and I feel really awkward as they're meant to be doing me a favour by providing me childcare but I feel I can't leave him alone with a baby. I don't want things to be hostile but I'm very concerned. Any suggestions are appreciated. Tia.   \n",

lonely dad find some people to talk to. He wrote a bio about himself and asked me to post it for him. He is a lifer and needs some human interaction that isn't family. Here's his bio he wrote with his address included in it. Hes in kind of a bad spot mentally lately and I think this might help him a little bit. He said: \\n\\nHi! My name is Danny Clark. I am 53 and been down almost 25 years straight. I am doing the long road in here. I was convicted of first degree murder. I am Wiccan! I am also an artist of various forms. I draw, write, cross stitch, make sculptures, crochet, and do both beadwork and seed bead. \\nBeen lonely way to long, and now I am looking for someone to write, just hang out with and pass the time. I will answer all that write snailmail. I am tired of just looking out of a window at cars stopped at a stop light. Want someone that I can write and get to know. I like music of any kind also. So, what are you waiting for?! Hurry up and grab a pen and write that letter! You really dont want to miss the thoughts and ideas I have to present! Dont let me be the one you almost wrote, and wondered about. Go ahead and write me! We can talk about anything! I am:\\n\\nDanny Clark 83588\\n\\nP.O. Box 2\\n\\nLansing KS 66043\\n\\n\\n\\nEdit: My dad called today, and sounded happier than I have heard him in years! Within 4 days, he has received emails from over 100 people! He wanted me to tell everyone who emailed him, that if he could, he would individually thank every one of you, but sadly the prison is limiting him on how many he can see at a time. He isn't sure he will be able to even see them all. He did say he was sorry to anyone who wrote that he isn't able to respond to, and it is the prison saying he cant, not him. We were not expecting this much of a response! Because of this, I am removing the email information. He also said anyone who would like to write snail mail and talk to him that way is still welcome to do so. The prison cant really limit that. I do want everyone who wrote him to know that all of you truly helped him (and my family) in a way we could never thank you for.  Tonight as we were getting off of the phone, he said hes actually been seeing the beauty in people again, instead of the ugly he has for so many years. This whole thing has completely restored both of our faiths in humanity and the goodness that is within strangers from all over the world. Thank you all so much for the life you have put back into my dad.   \n",

I'm a senior college student with and my little sister is a high school junior. Our mother passed away almost a decade ago and my dad has raised us since then. Ever since she was in middle school, my sister has had a lot of problems on the internet via sexting adult strangers and getting into trouble at school. We tried to help her but she was intent on doing that stuff secretly and we'd occasionally catch her or get notified by the school. She's now 18 and last year she ran away to live with her 16 year old boyfriend, and ever since she's just been nasty to me and my dad, ie. telling us to leave her alone and then sending pics of her tattoo to my dad just to make him upset.\\n\\nParticularly she's had a strong type of hatred towards me. She keeps saying the worst kind of people always smile and laugh and no one ever seems to dislike them. Nevermind that our mother was just that, there weren't a lot of people that didn't like her because she was truly a nice person. And she keeps telling me that I'm not perfect. Obviously, I'm not, kind of a no brainer there. I may not have done what she's done in life, but I've screwed up enough in my own ways. And I openly admit to it. She gets mad that I get to go to college when she'll be lucky to graduate high school, though no one ever was stopping her and I believe if she really tried, she could do all that and even more. But she seems to resent me for at least trying not to be a complete jerkwad.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, I love her to bits. I always have, and I always will. She's my little sister, and no matter what she does I'd do anything for her. But I just don't know what to do right now. She even messaged me on my birthday asking about money, arranged a meet-up only to never show up (that one really hurt). I just wonder if there's anything I can do at this point. Thanks for listening, and I hope y'all have a good day.   \n",

and my dad to discuss my mom. She's been a problem for a long time but my dad kind of let's her walk over him, spend all his money, and complain about everyone else all day. I've seen this behavior for my entire life and I'm 22 and my brother is 26, neither of us living at home, so we're kind of removed from the situation. \\n\\nMy mom's problem has never manifested in a drug problem or had direct negative consequences that were really bad and with my history of drugs and my brothers mental health, she would never accept on her own that she has issues. I have been sorting through some of my own problems and cutting toxic people out of my life and it was there when I realized that my mom was toxic and at that moment I realized I do not want to cut my mom out of my life, and she won't listen to any one of us alone so we staged an intervention.\\n\\nWe all said our piece and when we were done I looked at my mom, and for the first time since I was a little kid who was obligated to, I looked at her and said \"Mom. I love you\" \\n\\nShe instantly lost it. So did I. We hugged for the first time in a long time. She agreed to get help and overall I feel like as a family we're all much closer now, and we understand that just as I didn't change in a day, neither will she, but it's a step in the right direction. I didn't even realize until today that I love her. We feel closer than we ever have as a family and I actually look forward to being around my own mother now.   \n",

26, recently moved home to try to save money for a house of my own. My mom lives in a second house on my grandparents' property, and has since she had me (single mom). We all split the utilities, and my mom and I do a lot of the yard work and maintenance for both houses, we shuttle my grandma to appointments and my mom looks after them when they're sick or injured, but not serious enough to need medical attention. She does things like help my grandpa with his toenails, and checks in on them, runs errands for them, etc etc.\\n\\nI have called my grandma \"gran\" for probably 10-15 years, it's going to be a very hard habit to break at this point. I don't know why he's just now decided he doesn't like it. I tried to comply at first, to avoid drama, but damn if it isn't hard to call someone something new after so many years. It's making me extremely stressed. Family dinner is a nightmare, I just don't talk to anyone.\\n\\nToday I was chatting with her and said something like \"thanks gran!\" and leaned down to kiss her cheek before I left, and he was like \"THANKS /WHO/???\" I just walked out without answering. I don't know what brought this on, and I'm stressed about confronting him, because technically our house is his house so he could kick me and my mom out if he got mad enough. My current strategy is just avoiding interaction with him, which also sucks-- because prior to all this nonsense, we got along great.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: I did talk to my grandma about it, and she said it doesn't bother her that I call her gran. She's very non confrontational, but also extremely honest. I know that if she'd told him that she didn't care for the nickname, she would have told me as much. She, for better or worse, won't confront him about it. But said that I could call her gran if I wanted to and that he didn't have a right to tell me, what I should call *her.*   \n",

My mom, who was a nurse, is 58, and my dad is 64. They are approaching visa agents who claim to provide jobs for nurses. The whole plan seems ridiculous and dangerous to me because of my parents' age, their lack of knowledge of the country's culture, the living expenses there, etc., and the potential risks involved in moving to a new country and setting up a life there. Not to mention that most of the agents so far do not seem to have any sort of credibility as far as I can see and are likely to steal money. My parents, however, are adamant on somehow getting to the US. They are not understanding that it's too late for them to take such a drastic decision. All they are thinking about is that the retirement age in the US is longer than that in India. There have been countless arguments so far where I hoped to get them to rethink the decision but none have worked. \\n\\nI would really appreciate if you could list the dangers they're likely to face if they go ahead and what would be the best course of action to make them understand the reality and the seriousness of the situation.\\n\\nThanks in advance.   \n",

with all the info, but the title says it all. Sorry for English, not a native speakeŕ.\\n\\nI (M20) just finished my first year at uni in UK, my sister (F15) and parents live in a different country so I can't really know what is happening at home, I went there just twice for a week since September. My sister just told me that she had found out about the cheating about two months ago. Genuinely, I didn't believe her, it would never even cross my mind. But she took pictures of my mom's conversation and I must admit it is sadly 100% true. (btw My sis waited those two months to tell me what's happening until I come home, which must have been so hard for her and she has all of the credit for that.)\\n\\nI was always saying that my parents are very contrasting in so many things and/or opinions. My dad is super stressed about everything, and quite disgusted by life, I'd say that the family has been the main engine in his life in last 10 years. He's not very happy with the way he lives and money he earns, but I know on 100% that he always gave everything to all three of us. I feel like he is a bit disappointed that he didn't do something big during the life, like he must have failed or something, can't really describe that properly but that might be quite normal at this lifestage (?) I can see that feeling was getting stronger and stronger in last few years.\\n\\nMy mom is calm, but sometimes even naive, and also quite submissive in the sense of making any decisions, she just says \"I don't really care\" or \"It doesn't matter that much\". When there were any small arguments it is usually because of the discrepancy in these character features.\\n\\nI don't think that the age difference between them is the problem. Mom has always been into older guys, and sadly it is this time as well. I also doubt it is about money.\\n\\nI have no idea what to do. I am thinking about telling to my uncle's girlfriend. I know I can tell her everything with honesty. She also stands kinda both in and out of the family as she knows my uncle (and thus my parents actually) for 15 years or so but doesn't plan a wedding or something and I believe she can see the thing subjectively.\\n\\nI also kinda plan to confront my mom about that = should I ???? If yes, how the fuck??\\n\\nAlso, I am leaving in two weeks again and the last thing is to ruin the family and then just leave, so I must be really careful with what I'm doing.\\n\\ntl;dr: My mom is cheating on my father, should I confront her??   \n",

with this, but I just really need advice. This may be a wall of text too because so much needs explaining, so I do apologise for that.\\n\\nSo as the title says, pretty much my whole family have had enough of my mum and she knows this, although she doesn’t understand why. \\n\\nLet me start by saying she is a fantastic grandma to her grandchildren, she loves them and absolutely adores them. She is battling COPD and a plethora of health issues as well as depression, anxiety and PTSD from my grandmas death 4 years ago. That being said, her personality and behaviour is pushing family members away, and as I am closest to her, I feel it is my responsibility to explain why seeing as she’s noticed people becoming distant and/or angry with her and doesn’t understand why.\\n\\nMy mum is quite narcissistic, always has to be right, gives unsolicited advice, rants about people treating her like shit all the time, she’s two faced, constantly has a need for attention and that’s just off the top of my head. \\n \\nA few months ago, a family member I’ll call AH attempted suicide and, although she was specifically told not to go to the hospital, she went anyway. She said she was there to support AH’s children and the rest of the family. Everyone was so worried as AH had been clinically dead for some time, but my mum went around telling everyone that she had got people praying for her and she’s be fine. AH pulled through and her vitals stabilised and my mum had the ‘told you so’ mentality, but then to take things further she actually told people ‘told you she’d be fine, I’ve had people praying for her, it’s not her time’!, which obviously annoyed the shit out of people there. She couldn’t understand why people were being cold and sharp with her. It really did hurt her, but I struggle to explain why the way she acted was the reason why.\\nThen came the ‘I have mental health issues too, but no one rushes to my side when I’m in crisis’. This was the day after AH hung herself and was found clinically dead, it was because my brother was visiting as he is close to that side of family and my mum has a bit of a fractured relationship with that side. Recently, my mum and AH’s husband were chatting about AH and AH’s husband  sent my mum a couple of videos of AH as she had brain damage from the lack of oxygen. My mum obviously had to bloody ask him to let her and all of her other friends pray for her and he lost it with her. It’s just not his belief. And its annoying. She rang me in tears and all I could say was ‘ Oh you know what he’s like’. \\n\\nEveryone is just so sick of her, I love her to bits but she’s driving me mad too. She’ll ring me to rant about family members, how she’s feels like no one respects her etc.. and it’s never a positive experience to talk to her in the phone. I have depression and anxiety and I’m struggling with two small children to make it through the day, and her phone calls make me feel so much worse. But if I tell her this, she’ll tell me ‘at least you don’t have PTSD and COPD too’. \\n\\nI’m just lost and I don’t know how to approach this with her. I feel like I’ll be criticising everything about her and she’ll feel attacked, which is usually how she reacts to anyone trying to discuss her behaviour with her. \\n\\nHas anyone got any advice please? \\n\\nI’m sorry for the wall of text, I have missed loads out but it’s 10am and I have two very bored toddlers wanting my attention, also it would be one hell of a long read. I also apologise for the formatting as I’m on mobile.\\n\\nTLDR; mum is annoying everyone and is hurt by everyone’s reaction to her, I want to explain why people are being cold/sharp/ distant with her in a loving way.   \n",

my family. I'm 17 and I've spent the last decade and a half verbally berating everyone, never doing anything for any of them, backstabbing, and not living up to any of their expectations. They hate me. But is it a cop out to say that I never believed most of my behavior to be bad? That if I was actually more self aware and conscious of other people that I wouldn't have done any of the horrible shit I put them through.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's taken a damn near traumatic experience to finally get through my mind that I am a horrible shithead. For the past three months they've been expressing just how much they hate me day in and day out. My dad told me he thinks I should be shot because of some fucking lie that's being spread about me. I've been heavily considering suicide some days recently and running away to start a new, homeless life even more. Everything is in shambles and I don't know what to do.\\n\\n\\n\\nIs it realistic to hope for forgiveness from any of them? It's been three months and they aren't letting up a single bit. Please don't give me a coddled answer.   \n",

I can be too sensitive and take things too personally but gees at times they can be too critical. For example, I gained 15-20 lbs but I am still in the healthy BMI range according to my doctor. My mother reminds me every day how I am getting fat, has called me fat, points out what I should or should not be eating. Everything I say is up for debate and criticism. Everything must have a rational reason behind no room for looking at things from an emotional perspective. I'd say what BOTHERS ME THE MOST is that when I'm wrong my parents are VERY CLEAR AND STRONGLY OPPOSE ME but they NEVER give me credit or concede when I'm right. If I want them to agree that I'm right, they complain I have an issue with pride and that I should accept everyone sees things differently. It FEELS like I CAN NEVER BE RIGHT. My family is the type of always remind you of your mistakes so you WILL NOT REPEAT THEM.   \n",

hard life. But despite that she is an amazing young woman and I’m so proud of her.\\n\\nMy oldest daughter is turning 18 tomorrow and I’m proud as fuck of her. She finds too much affection uncomfortable so I’ve kept things toned down for her but I need to tell people just how amazing she is. I took my 2 girls and left their father when they were 3 and 1.5 years old, the day after he shoved me against a wall and put his hands on my throat. The abuse had been going on for years, mostly verbal and sexual ( sexual to me only, not the girls) that eventually turned physical. That started 9 years of going in and out of family court, narcissistic abuse from their father and eventual step mother, threats from him to make the police take them from me so they’d never see him again and one incident of near kidnapping. I’d have to counsel the girls when they come from visiting him and counsel them before they went back. Eventually the girls refused to see him any more and we went to court for the last time - and he agreed to me having 100% custody. But when she went to high school there was a teacher that looked, acted and sounded like her father and she had a breakdown. She was so scared and emotional, she blamed herself for everything, for not being good enough, smart enough or thin and pretty enough. She started cutting herself and was actively suicidal. I was so scared for her and I just wanted to go into her brain and erase all the horrible, derogatory things that her father said to her so that she could be a normal, happy teenager. But I couldn’t so I took her to a psychologist. For 5 years. She has PTSD, general anxiety, health anxiety and depression. We worked really hard together to challenge her automatic thoughts that told her things were going to go wrong and it will be her fault and she needed to be punished (her father, being a narcissist, was never happy or satisfied with anything the girls did and would punish them for not meeting his ridiculously high expectations. When he was no longer there to punish her, she punished herself by cutting). She was close to overdosing on paracetamol 4 times that I know of, popped out the pills, held them in her hand but threw them away instead. She stopped cutting a couple of years ago. She learned how to self regulate her emotions. She learned how to reflect on actions and thoughts to chose an alternative behaviour next time. She is incredibly tolerant and accepting of others and an advocate for animals and the LGBT community. 2 weeks ago she sat for her driving learners test - an extremely anxiety provoking situation - and passed with 100%. She donates her pocket money to worthy causes such as vet bills or families in hardship (we had a house fire almost 3 years ago and she remembers how hard that was and how much the community and complete strangers helped us, so she wants to give back). She is looking at going to TAFE this year as a pathway to uni. My first baby is turning 18 tomorrow and I couldn’t be prouder of the amazing young woman she is.

It was totally down to him, but if you asked him henmight blame me. Today is my grandparents wedding anniversary so the whole extended family was out for dinner. I saw family I hadn't seen in years.\\n\\nIncluding my dad and stepmum. He didn't look in my direction all night. They arrived late and left without my aunt and uncle they were supposed to drop home.\\n\\nMy mum and I can barely stay mad at each other for an hour. My stepdad and I usualy last a day mad at each other, at most. My dad hasn't spoken to me in 10 years and ignored not only me but the family I was sitting with.\\n\\nSo if you're reading this Dad, here goes. I hate you, but I miss you. I love you, but you're an ass.\\n\\nEither way, I won't let you shut me away from my family any more.   \n",

There is just no foundation between those two to raise a child! I have always thought she should start seeing a therapist due to her explosive anger and how her and our father did not get along. She also lives out of the country so it’s not like we (her family) can help and support her.     \n",

She lives out of state. Not only does she have a carpet beetle and stink bug infestation, but she also just doesn't clean. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI am the daughter of a Father who was basically a professional student, and a professor of nursing. So, I was taught about all the lovely kinds of bacteria and what-not that likes to hang around a dirty kitchen. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy Mother and I agreed to have a small BBQ for everyone at the house (My Mother, My Aunt, a family friend and I) on a day that everyone had off from work. I bought everything for the BBQ. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nNow, come the day of the BBQ, and I am trying to scrub and clean the kitchen so I can safely, cleanly prep raw food, but my Mother is throwing some kind of impatient-autistic-REE-temper-tantrum because I am cleaning instead of prepping/cooking. I lost my temper and I told her straight out that I will NOT prep/cook food in her filthy kitchen that has clearly not been properly cleaned in months until things are up to my standards. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThen she turned around and tried to play some guilt trip about \"Well, I'm sorry that things are not up to your standards.\" \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI didn't say anything after that, but I'm thinking to myself \"Standards?\" \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThere's a basic level of sanitation that an individual SHOULD keep up...THEN there's standards. That place wasn't even up to a basic level of sanitation. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI feel bad...but then again, I don't...because I feel I got it across to her that she lives like a pig.    \n",

and I (26f) have been married a year. Not planning to have kids in the near future as I want to finish my masters, but I have to ask the parents out there. Did you have any doubts and what made you change? I’m honestly having a debate with myself if I want children or not. My husband seems to be on the same boat. We got married thinking we want them. And now we like the idea of money an vacations. And sometimes i want little “uses” running around. Any advice!?    \n",

For personal reasons, I dislike my current city of residence. Like really don't see myself being happy here. I have a great opportunity to transfer colleges to a different city in the other side of the country(I am from Canada) . I've always wanted to live there. I even visited for a week and I am in love with the place.\\n\\nOne problem, I really love my family. I will miss them a lot. Especially my 4 year old sister. My parents married early so they were young enough for my sister to come late to the party lol. We're really close since I'm nicer to her and my younger brother(18) pranks her a lot. \\nMy family briefly moved away to the US for 2 years and I had to move into student residence. She used to ask my mom or dad to call me a lot  and she'd say she misses me and when I will be coming  home. It pains me to think she's going to grow up without me around. I won't be there to read her bedtime stories, babysit, help her with homework and by the time she's 11 or 12, she won't have the same closeness with me, I will probably be just another cousin or distant family member. Maybe it's because of my desire to have my own children someday. \\n\\nHowever, I realize I am old enough. I need to build my own life, meet new people, explore the world, make a life for myself separate from what my parents have. There is a burning flame in me that craves for that. \\n   \n",

   Hey all I am writing here because my family has tried almost everything and nothing has helped.\\n\\nI'll try to make this short but detailed. My mom has been sick her whole life with cancers and other mental health illnesses. My brother has been addicted to drugs like cocaine and weed recently. He said he hasn't done cocaine for 2 months ( supposedly). He also has a very bad temper and attitude and will outburst at everything and anything. \\n\\nMy brother (27) lives at home, doesnt have a job and doesnt really do anything to help around the house. He has had multiple jobs in the past and has been fired from them for not showing up. My brother is a chronic liar and lies to my family consistently. He has stolen things from my parents to sell them for money and has taken out thousands of dollars of loans that he now owes. He states he is depressed and we have tried to help him by being there for him or getting professional help but nothing has helped. He doesnt go to the appointments or falls back into the same patterns. \\n\\nMy dad tried to get him a job at his work but he always states he is sick and not feeling well to go but then stays home and plays video games all day. My family has threated to kick him out numerous times and he guilts them threatening to kill himself or break into the house. He has tried to harm himself multiple times due to fighting with parents which makes them stressed, feel guilty and scared.\\n\\nThis is putting a huge amount of huge stress on my family, especially my mom, she always seems like she is going to have a nervous break down.. we are so lost and dont know what to do anymore. \\n\\nPlease please any suggestions.   \n",

I am very close to them, but I moved an hour away about a year ago. I don't get to see them as often as I'd like, due to me working and planning my wedding. My niece also works part time and is in school. \\n\\nWe were supposed to go to a comic con this weekend, but I had to tell her no. I had to get some maintenance done to my car and I just can't afford it. The con isn't that much, but it's a two hour drive. \\n\\nShe is upset with me and I feel disappointed in myself. I feel like a bad aunt. I've always done things with her and taken her places, etc, but that was when I lived close by. I also have to work every Saturday until the afternoon with my new job.\\n\\nI don't want her, or my nephew, to think I don't love them or that I am avoiding spending time with them. I make time when I can. Between work and planning a wedding, my life is super hectic right now. I try to explain this to her, but she is a teenager and you know how that goes.    \n",

family or be close to family members? I don't know how a family works. I don't know how to be close to a family member. Would you give your kids the opportunity to be close to family members (cousins, aunts, grandparents) if you could? Spouses family? Would it be deal breaking in where you chose to raise your own family? Does anyone feel like they are missing something not growing up with any extended family members?**\\n\\nYou can skip the story and answer the td;lr if you want. Growing up I always felt pretty lonely. Moved a lot. Didn't grow up close with parents. So I don't feel anything towards them and they don't care to spend time with my kids. I have a hard time getting close w/ ppl in general except really close friends but I wasn't hugged or anything as a kid so I still feel an awkwardness with being affectionate?? My siblings as well. We are clingy towards our spouses.\\n\\nLong story short, we were planning to move near husbands family ASAP b/c our kids are close in age with their cousins and we want them to grow up together but suddenly this year husbands siblings are separating from their spouses and now their focus is no longer on their kids but their new partners. My texts are going unanswered about school breaks b/c they bounce the kid between the 2 sets of grandparents etc, and they will just text me about all these new things they are doing, no mention of their kids?? My kids love their cousins but I feel like everyone is moving on from the joys of spending time as a family. They let the ipad's babysit the kids now. 4 of their cousins sit on their ipads/phones all day. I feel like I'm the bad one making my kids \"play\". I try to ignore it during vacations but now its all starting to get to me. How does a family work??\\n\\nAdvice? Help?\\n\\n*We have basically two options:*\\n\\n1. Move near husbands family where we wouldn't be able to afford a nicer home for awhile but the weather is perfect and close in drive to many cities. But I would struggle with discipline but maybe I can make it work with keeping schedules. I would always be the mean one though ;p And I can't guarantee my kids will even see their cousins anymore as their parents make their new lives.\\n2. Move to another state husband can transfer to but with no family around, high humidity (time spent mostly indoors) and depend on school breaks for visiting family. Who knows, I might feel lonely w/ a nice house and time spent mainly on my kids. or is that the best option?   \n",

                                                                                                                                                    I don't know if this should go here, but it's about my brother, sooo.. Yea. TL:DR at the end. Sorry for any grammar error. \\n\\nA little bit of background. My dad and my brother are very explosive when they get angry, but my brother has the habit of slamming doors and throwing tantrums when he gets mad. Also he gets mad very easily. He gets angry when he's hungry, he gets angry when he's sleepy, he gets angry when he's sick, you get the idea. \\nAlso, my brother and my sister get a little bit of money every 2 weeks for school, lunch, and busses. \\n\\nSo this follows 3 incidents with my brother's tantrums.\\n\\nThe first incident happened a month ago or so. My little sister was bothering him and he got angry, slamming open our front bars door and in doing so cracking the wall. A piece of wall fell of and my parents got mad at him, but not punishment fell in him that day.\\n\\nThe second one was a week ago. I was in the common room with my mom and we were watching \"A star is born\". Now, I tend to comment a lot about movies at home. I talk about the plot, the music the actors and so on. And my voice is kinda loud. That day my brother was sick in his bedroom. Aaand, that movie took me into an emotional roller-coaster so I was laughing, crying and kinda screaming with my mom. My brother got mad and asked for me to turn down my voice, fair enough, I lower the volume and say if we're bothering him, he could close the door. We continue watching the movie, and then he just slammed the door. My mom went and scolded him about it, saying how he doesn't get mad when his friends are staying for the night and making a lot of noise even when my dad and I are trying to sleep because we have work. Again, nothing meaningful happens to him.\\n\\nBut lastly, that weekend karma came for his soul.\\n\\nThat Sunday, my mom, my granny, my sister and I went to get some groceries, my dad went to road with his friends and my brother stayed home. My mom called him after we went to ask him to wash the dishes and broom a little. He tried to protest but said yes. 30 minutes later he calls my mom and the conversation went as follows :\\n\\nBro : Hey... Mom... Can.. Can you buy a new doorknob please?\\nMom: a new doorknob? Why?\\nBro: The... Kitchen doorknob... Broke.\\n\\nTurns out, Bro didn't liked being asked to clean, so in his way out to get the broom he shut open the kitchen door, slamming the doorknob on the wall and leaving it useless. My mom had enough. She handed him that Monday his money for the 2 weeks (maybe 17 dollars) and said to him he had to buy a new doorknob himself, with his money.\\nNow, my mom packs my sibling some lunch so they can eat at recess, but the money is for any craving or a movie. Needless to say he lost almost all of his money for the two weeks and only had left money for the bus home.\\n\\nTL:DR: Bro likes to trow tantrums, breaks our kitchen doorknob and losses almost all his money for 2 weeks.    \n",

                     Hi everyone! How are we this fine evening?\\n\\nIn January, I moved home to help my mother out. She's getting on a bit, really suffers with her bones and has a couple of hernias in her stomach. She claims PIP and ESA and was supporting my brother on this money before I made arrangements to move back in so I can help her with the bills and housework.\\n\\nReddit, I need your advice on what to do about my brother. \\n\\nHe is 20 and honestly a massive waste of human existence. He sits in his room with his chav friends all day every day playing on his Xbox, smoking mum's tobacco and eating food he so thoughtfully cooked for himself and his friends without asking us first. This pattern of behaviour only changes on weekends. From Friday until Monday, he disappears with his aforementioned friends. When he comes back, he's usually high on weed, coke, speed, MDMA and God only knows what else. This is just the stuff I know he takes. I also have reason to suspect he was stealing mum's pills as well before I came back because I caught him in the act of stealing some of my medication. I've since hidden all of mine and mum's prescription meds, along with our money and bank cards because I just can't trust him not to steal from us. \\n\\nHe refuses to get a job, doesn't claim JSA and won't even attempt to get PIP for his supposed mental illness (tbh I think the only mental illness he has is self-inflicted with drug use). \\n\\nWhen I last visited before moving down here, he bullied and emotionally manipulated mum into buying him a new iPhone because he threw the old one in temper and smashed it. She bought him one despite me telling her to put her foot down. He doesn't even clean his own piss off the toilet seat and refuses to help around the house.\\n\\nReddit, I'm at my wits end with him. Mum doesn't want to kick him out because it'll make him homeless, and I don't want to drive a wedge between me and her by doing it myself. But I don't know how much longer I can handle his appalling behaviour and laziness. What the hell can I do about him?   \n",

at the time but I am a decent child to bare with I sometimes complain but not always I obey my parents but my brother doesnt. So back when I was 9yo and my brother was 10yo he changed into a know it all stubbern little brat. He got put in a magnet class (which is a class for the smart kids in school) i wasnt in a class like that though. I was in a regular class like some of the people out there. My brother started to get bad WHEN HE GOT HIS PHONE remember that. When we tried and tried to search his phone he wouldnt let us so we knew something was up. It wasnt until this happened, when he got a computer. Me \"hey brother can i come in\" brother \"why\" me \"because i wanna play\" brother \"ok\" me (comes in)\"hey\" brother \"hey\" when i looked at the computer a discord message popped up at the bottom right part of the screen saying something of the lines \"wanna fuck me\" and i was in shock pretending i didnt see it and left the room and after that hes been mean and abusive to my whole family and doing what he wants when ever he wants but we got used to it. Btw we had to call the cops on him 3 TIMES and others called on him 2 TIMES but we didnt answer the door to those times cause we were gone our neighbors had told us that while we were gone. One time why we called the cops is because my brother had taken MY SKATEBOARD AND HIT ME IN THE HEAD WITH THE TRUCKS. Hope you guys enjoyed this remember im 12 so if i spelt anything wrong im sorry and have a AMAZING DAY.   \n",

I am the oldest of 5 and they are the middle and youngest of 3.\\n\\nI find they are immature when reacting to certain things and obviously there are other factors at play aswell but I wonder if I was raised by an eldest parent if it would make much of a difference.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I posted something similar to what is below last year on reddit:\\n\"Last year my father passed away suddenly. I saw him on the operation table and it obvious many different types of procedures were recently attempted to try to save him when I arrived with my mom to see him. My brother later came with his fiance and saw him before my dad was cleaned up and put in another room. What followed that day and later that month totally took me by surprise. My grandmother told my brother the day of my dads death that my dad left \"nothing\" for her and my uncle called for official death certificates while we were still in the hospital. My mom brother, his fiance and I all expressed outrage that people could be so mean and cruel. Then out of then blue probably a week or so after the funeral my brothers fiance told my mom that an attorney told her(sil) that the kids(which includes my brother who she eventually married, my other brother and me)get half of the estate. I couldn't believe she would tell my mom that, like she was putting my mom on notice that my mom better not claim my dads portion of the estate and threatening to put my mom through legal trouble and stress (due to increased legal fees my mom would have to pay) in order to make sure her husband(my brother) would get his inheritance that she feels she would benefit from. The fact that she did this after I sought her comfort and held her while I cried my dads ashes being stored in the niche and during the wedding when my dad was being remembered makes me so angry and I feel betrayed by her. \\n\\nShe has done other things following my dads death that irk me like not letting and or offering for my mom to be with my brother for a ceremony, and a total personality change after the marriage was legally finalized. However her comments to my mom about the distribution of my dads estate are particularly evil in my opinion. There is an understanding that my relatives on my dads side are not welcome to be anywhere near my dads estate due to their appalling behavior. I can argue that my brothers now wife has shown similar if not worse behavior. Therefore, I am considering banning her and her family as well as I am a trustee of the estate.\"\\n\\nSince this post was made,I have attended sessions with a marriage and family therapist with my brother and mom present. The therapist explained initially that there are separate \" family systems\" (nuclear family, in laws etc) and that when someone gets married there is tension due to the change in the family dynamic. Commonly mom or dad can get tempted to get involved in private issues of son or daughter's marriage. He says family need to respect the boundaries of each individual family system. When I told him \"well what about the sil? She didn't respect the boundaries of my family system(nobody gave her permission to ask about inheritance). The therapist then was stuck but I knew he agreed with my rebuttal but doing so aloud would overwhelm my brother so he told me to talk with my brother one on one. I did just that and asked my brother, \"do you believe what your wife did by telling our mom that an attorney told her that the kids get half of the estate is appropriate?\" He said I dont agree with the premise of your argument(what ever that was supposed to mean) and tried to justify her actions by saying she is not like that.\\n\\nI went to another session alone and the therapist(who saw my sil and my brother individually)said that my sil is extremely attached to her family of origin and is mainly concerned about doing things for their and my brothers benefit. When I asked him if it is reasonable to believe that she is concerned about the benefits my brother receive because she wants access to the family money and she is using her child to manipulate my mom for money and access to properties via free or reduced rents for her and her family of origin, he told me that based on his session with my sil and her past actions my suspicions are reasonable. He made it a point that my sil telling my mom that an attorney told her that the kids get half of the estate is inappropriate and there is no justification for it because she made a choice to say those things.\\nHe did try to tell me to be the \"bigger person\" and to use his observations to try to better understand where she is coming from(he said he believes my sil didnt do what she did because she hates me in particular, she just doesn't care about how I feel because she is primarily concerned about her family of origin and getting benefits for them)because if I don't i risk damaging my relationship with my brother and having him side with my sister in law and her family. I told him I cant control if that happens and will have to accept that he made that choice if he makes it.\\n\\nHe then told me to have a discussion about where my brothers stand on the situation because he feels I deserve to know straight from them, particularly the married  brother, whether they think what my sister in law did was inappropriate, my thoughts about her intentions are understandable and justified, and whether I have the assurance that my sil and her family will not be allowed to touch any family money or set foot in any commercial building that is family owned (having this assurance from both of them is important because therapist agreed with me that having sil and her family involved in my family's money and estate not ideal). The therapist told me that should I not get the assurance from my married brother, I am justified to take steps to keep her and her family away from the estate as my intentions he feels are based on protecting my dads legacy and the family money not trying to gain money unfairly for myself. Even thought my mom agrees with my stance on the situation, she objects to me talking to my brothers about where they stand. She told me if I did that my married  brother would ask her for money and it would cause her stress. I feel she could just tell him no. However I feel she is trying to protect my married brother because she feels his marriage would collapse and he wouldnt be able to deal with the financial and emotional stress of a divorce. On top of that I think the true opinions from two people whose opinion he finds credible(mom and therapist) about the situation would cause my married brother to breakdown mentally(my opinion I believe is being rationalized as \"irrational due to grief\" or \" sibling jealousy over marriage\" by my mom and brother to kick the can down the road so to speak) \\n\\nIs my sil justified to get involved in in laws inheritance because the inheritance would significantly impact her, her husband and her child life and her husband is a beneficiary of the inheritance(due to way my dad did things, inheritance ended up with my mom with me and my married brother trustees)?\\n\\nIs what my sil did inappropriate?\\n\\nIs what my mom doing(trying to prevent me from talking to my brothers about the situation) understandable? Is it justified for my mom to take actions to try to preserve a marriage that is not her own?\\n\\n\\n   \n",

2001 and I was born in 2003 so I never got the chance to meet her. Ive been feeling kinda down lately about it. My friend told me its wierd that I miss her. Is it wierd that i miss someone that I never met? Did anyone else loose a grandparent before they were born?   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              So, I have to work hard to buy clothes, pay my credit builder loan, pay for my own transportation and other shit... I also pay to have my hair done.  Now I know I am 19, I am an adult but my older sister never had to pay for anything on her own at 19.  My parents were rich when she was 19, they bought her a house, a car, 300 dollars for weaves, clothes and for  her college most likely. She didn't work, had everything given to her and when my parents lost their business, they still helped her with rent and she lived with her boyfriend who helped with rent. Now she basically lives off of using people somehow...  \\n\\nMy little sister is fucking 12 and she's a anime artist. She barely asks mom and dad for anything and pays for big purchases on her own...  She's 12 for crying out loud...  It really makes me fucking angry that me and my younger sister have to work for everything we want in life while my older sister had everything handed to her all her life...  She didn't have to work because she has everything already. I know a girl who's the same way... Just low key said she's not working because she has her parents to care for her... My older sister is the same way and it fucking pisses me off... My older sister had so many opportunities in her life and I always had to create mine.... \\n\\nAnd to add she has 7 boxes of clothes that perfectly fit me but she's so fucking selfish and self centered I'm not allowed to wear anything. I am going out to buy my own clothes but I shouldn't have too because she has 7-8  boxes of brand new fucking clothes.... How fucking selfish can you get?   \n",

           I'm 29 years old, unmarried, and for 5 years, I've been the provider of an 8 member family. One night when dad came home late, he's not drunk, but he took an alcohol to his system and it's very dangerous for him to even contain just a glass. He's sick and his doctor told him not to drink any. His medication is so expensive and I got the one to shoulder everything. I'm so disappointed so I got an argument with not to do it. He called me disrespectful and I got no voice to say anything. I told him that why won't I have a voice since I'm only helping him m, including helping the family and then mom crying because she found out that he drank alcohol again. He told me I'm a worthless son. I was deeply hurt inside that after all I've done to the family. He called me worthless. He's only 49, but stopped going to work. How do I deal with this feelings?   \n",

Ladies and gentlemen I would like to introduce you my brother; the guy\\n\\nwho got out of my mum’s vagina.\\n\\nHow could I have imagined that my blood would have been more harmful\\n\\nthan shooting some heroin straight to my brain.\\n\\nI wanna kill him, to give peace to such a noble sentiment as the hatred I feel\\n\\nand he doesn’t deserve.\\n\\nHis death would be such a joy for me, it would make my soul free from a\\n\\nburden heavier than a herd of elephants stepping on my heart while\\n\\nmating.\\n\\nIf I just could I would destroy his silly brain and eat his heart full of\\n\\nputrefied worms.\\n\\nI will love to create a bomb with his organs and let him blow as if he was a\\n\\ncheap explosive, I refrain myself from doing it because it would be too\\n\\npolluting for the environment, a bomb full of crap.\\n\\nI would love to organize an international party for his death and forget\\n\\nabout his miserable existence, the thought that he exists bothers me more\\n\\nthan a stuck dick in my ass paralyzed on a hard on.\\n\\nHe disgusts me to the point of making me vomit blood full of shit.\\n\\nI got a mouth diarrhea, I gotta puke words before being a serial killer and\\n\\ngo to prison for the rest of my life.\\n\\nOh shit you are talking about your brother!\\n\\nFuck yea, I am talking about him, would you imagine that your brother\\n\\ncould convince your mother to steal from you, taking advantages of your\\n\\ndistance, while you were trying to survive abroad?\\n\\nAnd when you were back you didn’t find your bed?\\n\\nThey stole my things, shitty fucking ticks more deadly than death, I hate\\n\\nyou!\\n\\nI fucking hate you.\\n\\nYou are fucking miserable so miserable not to deserve a sentiment as noble\\n\\nas my hatred, you would deserve indifference.\\n\\nAfter all, my brother is less valuable than a scrapped car.\\n\\nI hope you disappear from the earth before humanity is extinguished.\\n\\nYou contributed to make this world a piece of shit.\\n\\nIf I think I am your sister I wanna step back in another vagina and born\\n\\nagain from a different mother.\\n\\nI hope life will bring your life as you stole my soul through your violence,\\n\\nvile, filthy creature, I hope you die, but guess what for me you are dead and\\n\\nburied more than my dad, if I think about your breath I feel sick, if I ever\\n\\nsee your corpse on the street I will hit it in reverse.\\n\\nGoodbye for now, fucking asshole!\\n\\n[https://ellabi.com/let-me-introduce-you-my-blood/](https://ellabi.com/let-me-introduce-you-my-blood/)

We have always been really close until this year. He's a senior, and I understand that he needs space to become independent for collage, but it makes me really sad that he has become so distant. He never says hi to me at school, I ALWAYS say hi to him, he doesn't drive me to school anymore because he's driving his girlfriend, and he never does anything with me on the weekends. I've tried SO MANY TIMES, I have told him 20+ times that I want to spend more time with him, and I have asked him if he wants to do stuff with me etc. Eventually my parents tell him to spend more time with me so he does but it's only for a couple minutes. I don't know what to do, it feels like he already left for collage. I just want my brother back.   \n",

About two months ago, completely out of the blue, he is hitting, kicking, spitting, all kinds of stuff. At preschool he is throwing chairs and throwing toys. He makes a lot of verbal threats like \"I will hit you\" even when he is not showing any signs of being upset. Everyone keeps asking me what has changed at home, and to be honest nothing has. We (me and my boyfriend who has raised him since a few months old) are very calm and do not spank, and we have used many approaches to try to resolve this but right now I'm feeling a little burnt out, like nothing is helping him. His biological father had some mental health problems that I am worried may be passed on to my son, and I am feeling so guilty. I don't know where to go to get help or advice. I don't feel like this is out of control but I want to feel comfortable and confident in my parenting before it does become out of control. Thank you for any advice!   \n",



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So I haven’t seen my dad or my step mother in over 6 months. \\n\\nLittle back story, they’re both alcoholics like I’m talking they’ve been slamming vodka every night since I was 8 years old, I’m 23 now. So my dad used to be a bit on the abusive side, sometimes physical but mostly emotionally/mentally. My step mom is a Russian psycho when you push her buttons or when she’s drinking she is a loose cannon. While her daughter is currently recovering from heroin addiction over the past 2 years I’d say. \\n\\nSo years have gone by since any of that. I’m an adult now and I’d never let anything happen and he’s seemingly changed a bit so I was ready and willing to build a better relationship. He is my father and I love and care for him dearly. \\n\\nSo, December they had told us they were getting us plane tickets to come visit them (my boyfriend and I, my step-sister was not able to make it due to being in rehab) in Florida we had thought. Then a couple weeks later my dad calls me and tells us he’s taking us to Turks &amp; Caicos. An island they love and visit often. \\n\\nSo the trip starts off beautifully. We’re all laughing and smiling and getting along. It was great I really saw potential in everything. \\n\\nDay 3, that night as per usual they’re drinking (they just take straight shots of vodka throughout the night whereas they used to make mixed drinks with vodka and cranberry)\\nSo I’m complaining about my current job situation a little and my step mom starts to get defensive about my past mistakes with school and how they paid for one of my loans and basically starts throwing everything in my face saying I’m a fuck-up and they have me a great chance. I ended up running out of the house uncontrollably ugly sobbing (you know that cry where you literally can’t control it that it’s like all your emotions are just like OK NOW!)\\nI felt awful! Hurt and offended and embarrassed! Not only was she doing this on our “family vacation” but to top it off this was the first time they’re meeting my boyfriend. \\n\\nDay 4, I actually apologized to her firstly. Because towards the end of her lash out on me the night prior - I said something that i knew would hit her like a dagger, mostly only to shut her up because I was sick of hearing her insults. \\nSo I apologized first, was the bigger person, though I had no desire or care to be. In reality I really did it for my dad because I don’t really care about my relationship with my step-mom because in my honest opinion she’s a nasty cunt. \\n\\nDays go by, things are going well like nothing ever happened.\\n\\nDay 6, My boyfriend and I had a rough start to the morning. We got into a little tiff so we wanted to kind of keep to ourselves. Mind you we have spent every waking moment with my parents, beach during the day, we’d pack lunch then come back for dinner and watch movies all night. So our last day before we board the plane the next day, we wanted to take it easy and relax. We both weren’t in good moods so we weren’t trying to bug anyone else with our issues. We sat on the beach in the shade I read a book while he laid down. I ended up taking a nap in our room because I couldn’t sleep the night prior. It was like a 2 hour nap at best. My boyfriend this whole time had been sitting in the common room with my dad and step-mom watching some movie. So I wake up and my step moms walking around so I asked if the washer and dryer are free so we can do our laundry before we go back home. She had the balls to say to me “not all of us have the luxury of sleeping all day so no more laundry will be done today” first of all, what the fuck does one have to do with the other? Second of all, so because you want to be a big fat cunt, you’re going to make us go all the way home with dirty clothes in our luggage. Okay. \\n\\nThen, just as we’re about to get to bed and close the door, my step mom asks me to come sit and talk and I could her how drunk she was already. So I come out and before I even get the chance to sit down. She’s jumping down my throat. At this point my boyfriend comes out to make sure everything is alright. She jumps down his throat. Calling us “ungrateful,disgusting”said his “first impression was shit” that the next time was “family only” and if I’m being honest the only reason I was comfortable even going on vacation with them was because my boyfriend would be right by my side in case anything shitty happened (which it did). So my step mom and i are going back and forth. She’s Insulting myself and my boyfriend over and over. Because of this last day, because we weren’t having a good day and we ruined it for them because they didn’t enjoy seeing us “mope” as my dad casually stands next to her calling us disgusting and not having my back whatsoever. \\n\\nI was absolutely appalled. \\n\\nDidn’t talk to my dad for weeks after that,had no desire to. Until I finally tried to tell him how all that made me feel. Then he tries to blame other things and say he just wants the best for me that I’m “settling” because I got my boyfriend his dinner plates and do things for him. Jesus Christ like they have no idea how our relationship works. And if they had any issues. My father should’ve pulled me aside and privately talked to me about it! Because at this point why would my boyfriend ever want to see their faces again, and I’m jumping in that boat with him after all of that. Unless they quit drinking or something then I don’t know. \\n\\nIt’s just useless talking to my dad. He only disagrees with everything I say and they only see things the way that they want to see them. \\n\\nSuper long rant/story. But let me know, what would you do in this situation?\\n\\nI just don’t know how to feel anymore. \\n\\nAnd to add insult to injury, my blood brother hasn’t talked to my dad in over 7 years I’d say. That is a whole other story but like I’m at the point where I don’t want to cut him out of my life but like???? I can’t keep dealing with this. I just am so thankful I don’t ever have to live under his roof again    \n",

I have met people with 1 child and people with 11, but what number of people makes a family big?  If you have any adopted siblings, half siblings (is that the same as step sibling? if not, what is the difference), step parents, step siblings does that make any difference?   \n",
