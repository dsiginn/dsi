       "    'selftext': 'This is a story from when I was growing a spine. It\\'s an older one, but I\\'ll share it here for anyone who is shining up their own spine. A motivational missive maybe? I hope you enjoy.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI had a baby. Like you do. It doesn\\'t feel like it was terribly long ago but my kid is over ten so things have definitely changed since then. Back in those days, we didn\\'t have fancy video baby monitors or breathing sensors or any of the amazing fancy things you new moms get these days. We had a simple baby monitor. The base was in the baby\\'s room and the receiver was either in our bedroom or the living room, wherever we were. It was a pretty good monitor, you could definitely hear what was going on in the baby\\'s room... and so our story begins.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy parents were visiting. I didn\\'t know what a JustNo was at that time- I knew my biological father was abusive, hence the restraining orders. But my mom was so much better than him, I didn\\'t ever think to question what she said... until I became a mother. Then all bets were off. I lost my first baby and NOBODY was going to do anything wrong when my son was born. His health and safety came first. Anyway, my JSometimesMom and VeryJustYesSaintofAStepfather were visiting.  My mother had some opinions about our parenting decisions (things had changed since the 70\\'s?!?!? Who would have thought?) but kept them mostly to herself. Until my aunt called her. We were all in the living room and so she took her cell into the baby\\'s room to sit in the rocker and chat. And trash my parenting.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnd so we sat in the living room, my husband and I, (I don\\'t remember where my JYSF was) and heard her make fun of me and my choice of... everything. And how I was overprotective and this and that. It lasted a good 20 minutes. Then she came back, completely oblivious to the fact that we\\'d heard the whole thing. A lifetime of rugsweeping training kicked in and I pretended nothing had happened. More time passed in the visit, she played with the baby, I fed him, my stepfather came back from probably Home Depot. And we were all in the living room when the baby had a blowout.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nDH and I took the baby to his room to change the baby and get the blowout damage under control. And while we were in there, we were very aware that anything we said would be heard over the baby monitor in the living room. Both of my parents would hear anything we said. I can\\'t remember the specifics of what we said, but I know it was in reference to some \"suggestions\" my mother had made that were out of date or wouldn\\'t work for us. We weren\\'t mean or rude- just matter of fact about how it wouldn\\'t work. When the baby was cleaned up, we went back to the living room and were greeted with the biggest, cat-caught-the-canary, smirk on my mother\\'s face. We sat down and she said, \"You should be careful what you say in the room with the baby monitor.\"  \\n\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnd y\\'all. That new mom spine showed up. \"Yes,\" I said. \"We learned that when you were on the phone with Aunt.\"  \\n\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe smirk froze and then in an instant turned to horror.  Horror because her daughter dared talk back to her. Horror because she had been robbed of the gloating that she was so certain she was about to enjoy. But mainly horror because she had been sitting there stewing. And in her mind, she had worked herself up into believing that being overheard on the baby monitor was SHAMEFUL. And anyone who was overheard saying anything unflattering on the monitor deserved to be embarrassed and ashamed. So with that designated as the proper response in her mind, now that she had been caught out for that very thing, she had to be embarrassed and ashamed. And it was awesome. My JYSF chuckled and they left shortly after.   \\n\\n\\nThe end.',\n",

       "    'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a story from when I was growing a spine. It&amp;#39;s an older one, but I&amp;#39;ll share it here for anyone who is shining up their own spine. A motivational missive maybe? I hope you enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had a baby. Like you do. It doesn&amp;#39;t feel like it was terribly long ago but my kid is over ten so things have definitely changed since then. Back in those days, we didn&amp;#39;t have fancy video baby monitors or breathing sensors or any of the amazing fancy things you new moms get these days. We had a simple baby monitor. The base was in the baby&amp;#39;s room and the receiver was either in our bedroom or the living room, wherever we were. It was a pretty good monitor, you could definitely hear what was going on in the baby&amp;#39;s room... and so our story begins.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My parents were visiting. I didn&amp;#39;t know what a JustNo was at that time- I knew my biological father was abusive, hence the restraining orders. But my mom was so much better than him, I didn&amp;#39;t ever think to question what she said... until I became a mother. Then all bets were off. I lost my first baby and NOBODY was going to do anything wrong when my son was born. His health and safety came first. Anyway, my JSometimesMom and VeryJustYesSaintofAStepfather were visiting.  My mother had some opinions about our parenting decisions (things had changed since the 70&amp;#39;s?!?!? Who would have thought?) but kept them mostly to herself. Until my aunt called her. We were all in the living room and so she took her cell into the baby&amp;#39;s room to sit in the rocker and chat. And trash my parenting.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And so we sat in the living room, my husband and I, (I don&amp;#39;t remember where my JYSF was) and heard her make fun of me and my choice of... everything. And how I was overprotective and this and that. It lasted a good 20 minutes. Then she came back, completely oblivious to the fact that we&amp;#39;d heard the whole thing. A lifetime of rugsweeping training kicked in and I pretended nothing had happened. More time passed in the visit, she played with the baby, I fed him, my stepfather came back from probably Home Depot. And we were all in the living room when the baby had a blowout.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;DH and I took the baby to his room to change the baby and get the blowout damage under control.

We haven't seen DH little sister for a while so DH wanted to go. So I figure I can fake liking MIL for a night. \\n\\nWell his sister(17) asked me if I wanted to walk across the street with her to the store to buy a few things. And I ask DH if he would keep an eye on DS( and he said he would. \\n\\n\\nWhen we got back from the store I walk into the house and see DS sitting next to the power outlet pulling on cords that were plugged in and chewing on them. Now he's the part we're I mention he was soaking wet. MIL poured ice chips on the floor for him to play with because she doesn't have AC and it's around 100°. \\n\\nNow i asked nicely (because MIL was right next to him and I'm on the other side of the house ) if she would grab him. Well she looked at him said he's fine he's not in any danger. Well I got PISSEd that she wasnt taking it seriously so I ran to him and I picked him up. And I packed up all of our stuff and we left all without me saying a single word to MIL. \\n\\n\\nMoments later MIL shows up at our house (a 45 minute drive away) to demand I apologize and how I disrespected her in her own house and that I was very rude because she invited us over and bought all the food for dinner. (Which we didn't eat). She always claims that he outlets are surge protector safe. Which means DS wouldn't be able to electricute himself. (I thought load of bullshit but hey I've been wrong before.)  and I explained I wouldn't apologize and that I felt like my son was in danger and that I acted appropriately. And then I asked her to leave. \\n\\nNow my husband is very upset with me for making this all a huge thing and said I should have handled myself better. So I figured I would come here because many of you all understand the justNoMIL stand point and ask you if you all thought I over reacted? \\n\\n\\nAlso I'd like to apologize for how awful this is written I'm currently in my phone and extremely exhausted from today.\",\n",

Along the trip I got tons of pictures of him having fun. Everything seemed so great.\\n\\nMonday comes around and he gets home late in the evening and he has dark circles around his eyes and a cough. My mother in law leaves quickly because she still has to drop off my nephews 2 hours away.  I start unpacking my son’s bag and lo and behold there sits his medicine packs, completely untouched. I texted my mother in law and she says “ I didn’t think he really needed it, he wasn’t coughing much.” Ok first off you weren’t part of us making him therefore you DO NOT get to make medical decisions for him.

My MIL called DH and asked why wasn\\'t she told sooner, and he told her it was because he didnt want to yet. She was angered by the response, told my first child hello, and then hung up. She knew I was in the room (was stated earlier), and did not acknowledge it at all. 3 days passed, and she hasn\\'t called, texted, mentioned me, the pregnancy, or anything of the matter. THEN she shares my social media post as if nothing happened (and has yet to speak to us about it). \\n\\n1. I feel like she called and tried to make it about her, then got upset when she didn\\'t get the response she wanted \\n2. She\\'s getting congratulated left and right on social media, but has yet to congratulate her own son, so I feel like the post was just for attention.\\n3. The REAL reason she didn\\'t know sooner, is because she made my first pregnancy a living hell. She constantly made comments about me not eating enough (not true), she would act shocked when I ate around her, she kept tabs on my prenatal appointment times, and called literal minutes after every single appointment to ask how much I weigh, and shamed me the one appointment I didn\\'t gain weight... I had a melt down in the OB office because of it. My DH telling her \"because I didnt want to\", when she asked why wasn\\'t she told sooner was putting it nicely. \\n \\nI don\\'t want to speak to her. I feel like at this point,  whatever she has to say is fake/forced. She is trying to act like the whole thing never happened. So NOW if we address it, she\\'s going to act innocent. Should I address the situation anyway?',\n",

My MIL called DH and asked why wasn&amp;#39;t she told sooner, and he told her it was because he didnt want to yet. She was angered by the response, told my first child hello, and then hung up. She knew I was in the room (was stated earlier), and did not acknowledge it at all. 3 days passed, and she hasn&amp;#39;t called, texted, mentioned me, the pregnancy, or anything of the matter. THEN she shares my social media post as if nothing happened (and has yet to speak to us about it). &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ol&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;I feel like she called and tried to make it about her, then got upset when she didn&amp;#39;t get the response she wanted &lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;She&amp;#39;s getting congratulated left and right on social media, but has yet to congratulate her own son, so I feel like the post was just for attention.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;The REAL reason she didn&amp;#39;t know sooner, is because she made my first pregnancy a living hell. She constantly made comments about me not eating enough (not true), she would act shocked when I ate around her, she kept tabs on my prenatal appointment times, and called literal minutes after every single appointment to ask how much I weigh, and shamed me the one appointment I didn&amp;#39;t gain weight... I had a melt down in the OB office because of it. My DH telling her &amp;quot;because I didnt want to&amp;quot;, when she asked why wasn&amp;#39;t she told sooner was putting it nicely. &lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ol&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to speak to her. I feel like at this point,  whatever she has to say is fake/forced. She is trying to act like the whole thing never happened. So NOW if we address it, she&amp;#39;s going to act innocent. Should I address the situation anyway?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "    'selftext': 'To preface, this will be a long one, I\\'ll try to condense as much as possible. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nPrevious to our son being born, my SO and I moved in with his mother at her insistence to start saving for a home. We agreed with a 1-year max goal of purchasing a space of our own. She lives in a very large 6 bedroom house by herself and seemed quite excited to have us join her. We currently occupy the 3 bedroom portion of her basement where we mostly keep to ourselves and leave her to her own routine as often as possible. In exchange for our space, we pay a small amount in rent to help with the electric, etc. bills and I have taken over most of the house and yard duties (I\\'m a SAHM and really don\\'t mind, it keeps me busy). As of a few months ago, my SO and she started disagreeing. Everything from his job, his health, his parenting, his schedule, anything, really. I did my best to stay out of it, mostly because they were being quite petty with one another and I didn\\'t feel the need to interject and cause further drama but in my opinion, she was berating him constantly. Then the small oddities started occurring. Little rules such as no drinking in her home (she never had a problem beforehand and we drink maybe once a month, if at all), not using the dish drying rack (she \\\\*never\\\\* does dishes by the way, I take care of them), not parking where we have agreed to park from day 1, only using very, very specific spots in the fridge and pantry (she also doesn\\'t eat at home that often and has maybe a carton of milk and a few yogurts in the fridge, everything else is preperation items and leftovers from family meals that I make for everyone, including her) . All very weird, petty things that aren\\'t even worth diving deeper into. SO and MIL by this point have had a few extremely heated berating arguments and we were finally told to move out immediately. She \"can\\'t live like this.\" We accepted that we were going to have to use a chunk of our savings for a rental and found something that very weekend. When we informed her of our plans, she apologized and felt horrible that we would be using our funds for a rental instead of towards a home. We all agreed that we should stay. Not even a week later, SO and MIL engage in another heated argument and she threatens to call child protective services because he is abusive (for the record, he isn\\'t abusive IN THE LEAST, not to me, not to our children, he\\'s just fed up with her constant put-downs). This is when I finally started getting involved. When it comes to my children, I will not have someone threatening to have them removed from my custody. In hindsight, I realized later she would have no grounds for such a thing and it would be impossible to actually follow through with, but I digress. Things calmed down once again but only for a moment. While making breakfast for the family, MIL included (this is just days ago), she arrives in the kitchen to start talking down to my SO yet again. He loses it, she leaves the home out of anger, and we are left with PAGES of texts of our abusive behavior towards her and we need to be out of her house immediately (again). For the very first time in the 6 months we have lived there, I stand up for my family. I respond back to her texts with my own choice words of HER abusive behavior towards us. We get home to multiple eviction notices scattered around the home which I promptly gathered and tossed in her room while yelling at her to just leave us alone along with other choice words because by this point, I was incredibly fed up with her and her drama, especially after attempting to forgive her for the Child Protective Services threat. In front of me, she then calls the police and tells them I am threatening violence and trespassing. We gather the children and leave the house immediately. I spoke to the police officer on scene through a phone call and explain what actually happened and that we are rent-paying tenants of her home and will be returning. He agrees that we are allowed to and we go home. It\\'s been a horror show ever since we arrived. We do not have the time, energy, or funds to move out with such immediacy (my god, we need \\\\*at least\\\\* a week to find a rental, not an afternoon). Constant eviction noticed plastered around the home, stomping about whenever we are in the kitchen, blocking my car so I cannot leave, insert a million other passive aggressive actions here. Not to mention, I am no longer allowing her near my children or myself. It\\'s very clear she\\'s mentally unstable and understandably, I don\\'t feel safe around her. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nPhew, that was a mouthful. If you made it this far, bless you, you\\'re a Rockstar Reader. We have no idea how to navigate our living situation while we rental hunt. This person we are living with is a monster. She is abusive, she is aggressive, and now she is making things up to actual police officers in an attempt to have me arrested. I am worried she will succeed, I am worried she will go after my children (I am sending the oldest to stay with my parents in another state until we find a new home, I don\\'t want him near the drama), and I am worried she will damage or alter our things while we are not home. I have gone in and out of crying out of actual shock that a person could do this to someone else they previously (at least, seemingly) cared about. How do we do this?',\n",

       "    'selftext': 'So I’m back already. \\n\\nThank you to everyone who commented yesterday. It was very validating to hear that DH and I weren’t in the wrong for hosting separate celebrations for our families. \\n\\nI thought based on what happened yesterday we’d get at the very minimum a single months reprieve from MIL. Instead DH comes home from work today bearing “good” news. \\n\\nMil has apologized for lashing out at him yesterday stating she “has to come to terms” with how “it’s going to be from now on.”  \\n\\nBasically to sum up her text (I don’t have DH’s phone and I don’t want to ask for it) she’s sorry to DH, and needs time to adjust to me not wanting her around people of my religion. THIS IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL! She’s completely missed the point of us separating our parties! And not only that, but no where was there an apology for saying the things she did about myself nor my family! \\n\\nDH says he’s still upset with her but I don’t feel like he’s upset for the reasons he should be. I tried talking to him about it today but it just ended with him being defensive and saying that we aren’t hosting separate events from now on. Everyone is just either going to have to deal with it or not come because he’s not dealing with something like this again. I won’t get more into this because I know this is a DH problem at this point and that’s not what this particular sub is about. \\n\\nI’m very upset and feel like this was a nonapology from MIL. She’s more than likely going to expect things to go back to the way they were after a little bit of time has passed. I don’t think I can do that. She’s hurt our relationship very deeply at this point and I want nothing to do with her for the foreseeable future. Nor do I really want my son to have anything other than a superficial relationship with this woman. I know I can’t keep DS away from her realistically to DH she’s still his mom and he very much wants her in our sons and his life. \\n\\nNot looking forward to the next few months at all. I feel like I have a cloud hanging over me.\\n\\n\\nEdit: So I have slept on this and now I’m just PISSED. I’m mad that she thinks she can pull this crap with DH. I’m mad she threatened him with their relationship over something like this. I’m mad about her comments about me. I’m mad she hasn’t even hinted at an apology to me for the things she said. She will not be welcome in our home for some time. I deserve just as much as my husband to be comfortable in my home and she does not fit into that picture right now. She will also not be seeing myself nor my son for some time. Until she acknowledges what she said and has said behind my back was hurtful and can sincerely apologize.',\n",

       "    'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I’m back already. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who commented yesterday. It was very validating to hear that DH and I weren’t in the wrong for hosting separate celebrations for our families. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I thought based on what happened yesterday we’d get at the very minimum a single months reprieve from MIL. Instead DH comes home from work today bearing “good” news. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mil has apologized for lashing out at him yesterday stating she “has to come to terms” with how “it’s going to be from now on.”  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Basically to sum up her text (I don’t have DH’s phone and I don’t want to ask for it) she’s sorry to DH, and needs time to adjust to me not wanting her around people of my religion. THIS IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL! She’s completely missed the point of us separating our parties! And not only that, but no where was there an apology for saying the things she did about myself nor my family! &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;DH says he’s still upset with her but I don’t feel like he’s upset for the reasons he should be. I tried talking to him about it today but it just ended with him being defensive and saying that we aren’t hosting separate events from now on. Everyone is just either going to have to deal with it or not come because he’s not dealing with something like this again. I won’t get more into this because I know this is a DH problem at this point and that’s not what this particular sub is about. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m very upset and feel like this was a nonapology from MIL. She’s more than likely going to expect things to go back to the way they were after a little bit of time has passed. I don’t think I can do that. She’s hurt our relationship very deeply at this point and I want nothing to do with her for the foreseeable future. Nor do I really want my son to have anything other than a superficial relationship with this woman. I know I can’t keep DS away from her realistically to DH she’s still his mom and he very much wants her in our sons and his life. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Not looking forward to the next few months at all. I feel like I have a cloud hanging over me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: So I have slept on this and now I’m just PISSED. I’m mad that she thinks she can pull this crap with DH. I’m mad she threatened him with their relationship over something like this. I’m mad about her comments about me. I’m mad she hasn’t even hinted at an apology to me for the things she said. She will not be welcome in our home for some time. I deserve just as much as my husband to be comfortable in my home and she does not fit into that picture right now. She will also not be seeing myself nor my son for some time. Until she acknowledges what she said and has said behind my back was hurtful and can sincerely apologize.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "    'selftext': 'So I posted recently about my MIL who was put off by my \"bad energy\" and said she wasnt going to come over to our new house for a very long time. Well that didnt last, shortly after we had a housewarming with my family and invited his as well and she showed up! Kept to herself basically the entire time and didn\\'t engage in any socializing but everyone else had a great time and me and SO  just took it as closing the door on that situation.\\n\\nFast forward to this past weekend, my baby shower. My mom and aunt very graciously planned the whole thing out and it was lovely! The only thorn in my side was that MIL decided not to come. After the housewarming I was feeling good about things moving forward, she had helped us purchase the crib and things seemed to be looking up. Keep in mind that she has known the date, location, etc of the baby shower for months at this point. My mom had made an attempt to involve her in the planning and she told my mom \"no it\\'s okay do what you want\".\\n\\nMe and SO head out towards the shower when he receives a phone call through the Bluetooth system in his car from MIL. Her first question is if we are in the car together, he says yes and they begin speaking in Spanish. Now I wouldn\\'t consider myself exactly fluent but I think they highly underestimate just how much I actually understand. I hear her saying how she doesnt think she\\'s coming. She doesnt know anyone, she has no gifts to bring it\\'ll make her look bad, its too far (my mom lives about 45 minutes away), she\\'ll be the odd one out, amongst other things that I didnt quite catch. He keeps saying \"please come, for me\" she repeatedly says no, they continue this back and forth until she eventually says okay fine. \\n\\nHis summary to me of this conversation was basically \"oh she just feels bad because she doesnt have gifts to bring since shes already given them to us, but she\\'s about to leave\". So now I know that MIL doesn\\'t really want to be there but am satisfied that shes atleast still willing to suck it up and come. We arrive and not 5 minutes later SO gets a text and says \"my mom cant come, she says its raining too hard to drive.\" He accepts this excuse fully however I\\'m confused as to why she would be attempting to leave at the time the shower began and not the 40 minutes earlier she said she was? Me and SO live not 10 minutes from her so we know the weather wasn\\'t bad til later. \\n\\nI brush it off for the moment and enjoy the event. Later on when we head home I mention to him that I did feel hurt that she didn\\'t show up as this is her first grand child and it was important to us. He tries to make excuses for her and confessed that she didnt feel comfortable coming. This struck a cord remembering back to her extreme lack of understanding of my anxiety (see my last post) and the fact that I\\'ve pushed through being uncomfortable for her benefit many times already and had even been considering letting her be in the room for the birth despite having no real desire for her to be there, for my SO and her since it is her first grandchild.\\n\\nAfter this I don\\'t think I want to have her in the room. Her actions are beginning to concern me more for our future relationship and her relationship with my child. Would it be wrong of me to only have my mom and SO in the room?

       "    'selftext': 'My SO has now been dealing with a huge guilt trip shit storm and I\\'m feeling kind of guilty that he has to deal with this. \\n\\nMIL is in full temper tantrum mode. Sobbing, threatening to move far far away, more crying and is now getting FIL to relay her messages because she\\'s just so upset. Unfortunately, the guilt tripping and hearing about her tears seems to be having an effect on SO. For the life of me I can\\'t understand why, it\\'s her same old song and dance that we\\'ve been through many times. \\n\\nThey have accused me of some bizarre and impossible things considering our LO isn\\'t even born yet. Obviously I\\'m going to deny them access to the baby at all costs. I\\'m going to be overbearing and strict about \\'silly things like feeding and naps with the baby\\'. I won\\'t let her have a phone when she\\'s older. I\\'m going to be worse than nephew\\'s mom. Blahblahblah. I don\\'t know where any of this came from because I\\'ve never talked about any of these things with them. \\n\\nI\\'ve received texts saying that I\\'m portraying MIL as a monster, I\\'m wrong. I\\'m being petty and surmising horrible things. I need video evidence of her behaviour. I should have had a conversation with them (funny because they\\'ve never extended the same courtesy to me and when I have tried MIL throws a temper tantrum complete with crocodile tears, yelling and running away to slam doors because that\\'s \"just the way she is\"). I\\'ve placed SO in the middle of this, they\\'re now my family so I can\\'t act this way, then it was finished off with some strange lovebombing and guilt tripping about how SO\\'s grandma isn\\'t feeling well. \\n\\nWorst part is that SO is definitely back in the FOG. He doesn\\'t want to talk too much about all this shit because it \\'stresses him out and they ARE his parents\\' but he did want to ask me if I\\'m okay with them babysitting once my maternity leave is up. What in the actual fuck. Obviously my response was fuck no, over my dead fucking body. We\\'ve talked in the past about no unsupervised visits. The woman almost killed our dog for god\\'s sake, not trusting her with my fucking child. \\n\\nAll I can say is that I\\'m thankful for a supportive mom, sister and this community otherwise I\\'d be feeling pretty fucking alone right now. This is supposed to be a happy time for SO and I and this stupid woman has yet again made it all about her simply because she couldn\\'t respect the one boundary I tried to put in place of \\'I don\\'t want to be her friend right now.\\'',\n",

       "    'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My SO has now been dealing with a huge guilt trip shit storm and I&amp;#39;m feeling kind of guilty that he has to deal with this. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;MIL is in full temper tantrum mode. Sobbing, threatening to move far far away, more crying and is now getting FIL to relay her messages because she&amp;#39;s just so upset. Unfortunately, the guilt tripping and hearing about her tears seems to be having an effect on SO. For the life of me I can&amp;#39;t understand why, it&amp;#39;s her same old song and dance that we&amp;#39;ve been through many times. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They have accused me of some bizarre and impossible things considering our LO isn&amp;#39;t even born yet. Obviously I&amp;#39;m going to deny them access to the baby at all costs. I&amp;#39;m going to be overbearing and strict about &amp;#39;silly things like feeding and naps with the baby&amp;#39;. I won&amp;#39;t let her have a phone when she&amp;#39;s older. I&amp;#39;m going to be worse than nephew&amp;#39;s mom. Blahblahblah. I don&amp;#39;t know where any of this came from because I&amp;#39;ve never talked about any of these things with them. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve received texts saying that I&amp;#39;m portraying MIL as a monster, I&amp;#39;m wrong. I&amp;#39;m being petty and surmising horrible things. I need video evidence of her behaviour. I should have had a conversation with them (funny because they&amp;#39;ve never extended the same courtesy to me and when I have tried MIL throws a temper tantrum complete with crocodile tears, yelling and running away to slam doors because that&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;just the way she is&amp;quot;). I&amp;#39;ve placed SO in the middle of this, they&amp;#39;re now my family so I can&amp;#39;t act this way, then it was finished off with some strange lovebombing and guilt tripping about how SO&amp;#39;s grandma isn&amp;#39;t feeling well. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Worst part is that SO is definitely back in the FOG. He doesn&amp;#39;t want to talk too much about all this shit because it &amp;#39;stresses him out and they ARE his parents&amp;#39; but he did want to ask me if I&amp;#39;m okay with them babysitting once my maternity leave is up. What in the actual fuck. Obviously my response was fuck no, over my dead fucking body. We&amp;#39;ve talked in the past about no unsupervised visits. The woman almost killed our dog for god&amp;#39;s sake, not trusting her with my fucking child. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;All I can say is that I&amp;#39;m thankful for a supportive mom, sister and this community otherwise I&amp;#39;d be feeling pretty fucking alone right now. This is supposed to be a happy time for SO and I and this stupid woman has yet again made it all about her simply because she couldn&amp;#39;t respect the one boundary I tried to put in place of &amp;#39;I don&amp;#39;t want to be her friend right now.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "    'selftext': \"This issue was handled already but I am sure it will have long lasting consequences. At least it does for those who are not me, namely the aunt in this story and the Red Rocket.\\n\\nThe same week I went no contact with Red Rocket, actually just a day or two before, I got a text from her sister. It isn’t unheard of for me to get a direct message from the sisters (there are two, they function as a set). But this was different.\\n\\nFor context the first message was accompanied by a picture of my post on a local neighborhood group (that bitch isn’t even supposed to be in because she lives in another state and it is a closed FB group). All I said in the post was that I needed cheap Christmas lights because I was planning to use my MiL’s extra but she had sold them. Also we are atheist and raise our children secularly but Red Rocket has nagged me to decorate our house for Christmas so she can see lights from inside her house. She said it wasn’t fair we could see her lights and she didn’t get the same. I love lights and was all for it.\\n\\nSo, for your reading enjoyment, I give you the time I tried to mitigate the shit Red Rocket says behind my back with the nicer of DH’s two aunts:\\n\\n**Aunt**: Did you see this  give me give me give me I'm like Red Rocket starting to hate her what a brat snot and anything else Why is it we want every thing given to us I'm sorry but that is how I feel and I thought you didn't believe in Santa and the lights and decorations go with Christmas I'm totally confused by you no wonder it is hard\\n\\n**Me**: What? Red Rocket has offered us her extra lights because she wanted us to put lights on our house. She forgot and sold them. I still want to surprise dS1 (and Red Rocket, but I can't put that in a public post that I know she will see) and I want to do it for as cheap as possible. I have bought two sets for $2 from this post so far and found a thrift shop that has them for cheaper than the store.\\n\\nThat's all the post is about. What does your message mean?\\n\\nThis is AUNT, right?\\n\\n**Aunt**: Yes and I don't appreciate you putting she forgot it is only for drama just post you are in need of extra things that is like Taking a jab at her I have to feel for Red Rocket as that would just upset her more She is already torn about leaving adding to her anxiety won't help\\n\\n**Me**: I only put that as an explanation for why I want just running off to buy new at the store. \\n\\nI don't appreciate you assuming that I am jabbing anything at Red Rocket. I am not at all angry with her and I am really heartbroken over her leaving. Before she blew up at me and called me an unfit mother and tried to interfere in my marriage (all that happened out of the blue in two days) I felt like she was a mom to me. We understand that she is homesick and just want her to be happy.\\n\\nI am trying to be as supportive of her decisions as possible and help her get wherever she wants to go whenever she wants, including moving. Every time we are together she talks excitedly about what she imagines her life will be like back in Shittsville and it makes me incredibly sad that she is leaving, but I do not want to punish her for it or have anger in any way. \\n\\nI suspect she is telling you a different version of what life was like here for her to make it easier to come home. \\n\\n**Aunt**:  Not really she is homesick she was too isolated in a big city\\n\\n**Me**: She is telling us that I am too controlling and she doesn't know why DH ever married me. She accused us of allowing the dog to sexually assault DS. She accused me of elder abuse for cursing. She's picking fights to push us away so it is easier for her to move.\\n\\nWe aren't taking the bait anymore (not since the dog incident, since it was so out there we thought it was a joke at first) and are continuing to live peacefully. I know her anxiety is high so we are trying to take her lead on contact so we don't stress her out. \\n\\nI hope you don't believe all that she says about us. The things she says when she is mad indicate that she is saying things about us that may not be accurate when she isn't mad. After your visit she started talking about how her BUSINESS stuff was us taking advantage of her but she always decided where the money went and if we were going to look for STOCK. We didn't take money from it, she decided what it would be spent on. But her feelings towards it seemed to change and we tried to go along with that too. We've tried to accommodate all the projects she has shown interest in.\\n\\nAnyway, frankly, I intend to make sure that I honor my promise to take care of her while she is here and make sure that I support her in her transition. \\n\\nI have pushed fairly hard for her to treat her anxiety because it is driving a lot of her daily life, even in retirement. I hope she finds a path to happiness.\\n\\n**Aunt**:  (no response)\\n\\nOh my god I just re-read the first thing you sent and I realized if I add punctuation it makes sense. And that you didn't mean to send it to me and you are saying you hate me. \\n\\nUm, yeah. Okay. I guess I really do know what Red Rocket says behind our backs.\\n\\n**Aunt**: No I'm saying I'm like her and basically everyone else that I'm am starting to hate everyone and their little comments I was so upset I type faster than I think and I do read things out of text sometime but I'm am still upset with this give me world and no one wants to work and earn their own way\\n\\n**Me**: So you think I am lazy because I made a post asking about Christmas lights? I paid for the damn things. Or is it because I stay home with my kids? \\n\\nIf I worked my kids couldn't go to their IMPORTANT MEDICAL STUFF. \\n\\nI don't want things given to me. I'd love to work. But my work is here making sure my kids have the best step forward in life they can possibly have. If me trying to find a deal on Facebook is so offensive to you that you feel you need to say you hate me, then maybe you should apologize. \\n\\nNo modifiers. Just an apology would be nice.\\n.......\\n\\nNo apology ever arrived. Shocker, I know. \\n\\nSo now for the pettiest or revenges. I continued to gather lights and then hit Walmart to buy strands that specifically did not match what I had already gathered. We did the worst decorating job we could. Strings hung mismatched and limply off the the windows and porch. I pooled a long red strand under the porch to make it look like someone bled out there in glowing lights. But we took all the lights that matched and put them neatly on the inside of the fence so we could see them looking nice, but she couldn’t. She could only see the front of our house and it looked like we tortured elves for fun and led a coup against Santa. \\n\\nWe left the lights up far too long. Red Rocket left 2/20 and we had them up until 3/1. I wanted to take them down 2/21 but it was snowing for a week. I also left them on all the time, no timer. \\n\\nNext year our lights will be amazing.\",\n",

       "    'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This issue was handled already but I am sure it will have long lasting consequences. At least it does for those who are not me, namely the aunt in this story and the Red Rocket.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The same week I went no contact with Red Rocket, actually just a day or two before, I got a text from her sister. It isn’t unheard of for me to get a direct message from the sisters (there are two, they function as a set). But this was different.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For context the first message was accompanied by a picture of my post on a local neighborhood group (that bitch isn’t even supposed to be in because she lives in another state and it is a closed FB group). All I said in the post was that I needed cheap Christmas lights because I was planning to use my MiL’s extra but she had sold them. Also we are atheist and raise our children secularly but Red Rocket has nagged me to decorate our house for Christmas so she can see lights from inside her house. She said it wasn’t fair we could see her lights and she didn’t get the same. I love lights and was all for it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So, for your reading enjoyment, I give you the time I tried to mitigate the shit Red Rocket says behind my back with the nicer of DH’s two aunts:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aunt&lt;/strong&gt;: Did you see this  give me give me give me I&amp;#39;m like Red Rocket starting to hate her what a brat snot and anything else Why is it we want every thing given to us I&amp;#39;m sorry but that is how I feel and I thought you didn&amp;#39;t believe in Santa and the lights and decorations go with Christmas I&amp;#39;m totally confused by you no wonder it is hard&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: What? Red Rocket has offered us her extra lights because she wanted us to put lights on our house. She forgot and sold them. I still want to surprise dS1 (and Red Rocket, but I can&amp;#39;t put that in a public post that I know she will see) and I want to do it for as cheap as possible. I have bought two sets for $2 from this post so far and found a thrift shop that has them for cheaper than the store.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all the post is about. What does your message mean?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This is AUNT, right?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aunt&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes and I don&amp;#39;t appreciate you putting she forgot it is only for drama just post you are in need of extra things that is like Taking a jab at her I have to feel for Red Rocket as that would just upset her more She is already torn about leaving adding to her anxiety won&amp;#39;t help&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: I only put that as an explanation for why I want just running off to buy new at the store. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t appreciate you assuming that I am jabbing anything at Red Rocket. I am not at all angry with her and I am really heartbroken over her leaving. Before she blew up at me and called me an unfit mother and tried to interfere in my marriage (all that happened out of the blue in two days) I felt like she was a mom to me. We understand that she is homesick and just want her to be happy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I am trying to be as supportive of her decisions as possible and help her get wherever she wants to go whenever she wants, including moving. Every time we are together she talks excitedly about what she imagines her life will be like back in Shittsville and it makes me incredibly sad that she is leaving, but I do not want to punish her for it or have anger in any way. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect she is telling you a different version of what life was like here for her to make it easier to come home. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aunt&lt;/strong&gt;:  Not really she is homesick she was too isolated in a big city&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: She is telling us that I am too controlling and she doesn&amp;#39;t know why DH ever married me. She accused us of allowing the dog to sexually assault DS. She accused me of elder abuse for cursing. She&amp;#39;s picking fights to push us away so it is easier for her to move.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We aren&amp;#39;t taking the bait anymore (not since the dog incident, since it was so out there we thought it was a joke at first) and are continuing to live peacefully. I know her anxiety is high so we are trying to take her lead on contact so we don&amp;#39;t stress her out. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you don&amp;#39;t believe all that she says about us. The things she says when she is mad indicate that she is saying things about us that may not be accurate when she isn&amp;#39;t mad. After your visit she started talking about how her BUSINESS stuff was us taking advantage of her but she always decided where the money went and if we were going to look for STOCK. We didn&amp;#39;t take money from it, she decided what it would be spent on. But her feelings towards it seemed to change and we tried to go along with that too. We&amp;#39;ve tried to accommodate all the projects she has shown interest in.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, frankly, I intend to make sure that I honor my promise to take care of her while she is here and make sure that I support her in her transition. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I have pushed fairly hard for her to treat her anxiety because it is driving a lot of her daily life, even in retirement. I hope she finds a path to happiness.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aunt&lt;/strong&gt;:  (no response)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Oh my god I just re-read the first thing you sent and I realized if I add punctuation it makes sense. And that you didn&amp;#39;t mean to send it to me and you are saying you hate me. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Um, yeah. Okay. I guess I really do know what Red Rocket says behind our backs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aunt&lt;/strong&gt;: No I&amp;#39;m saying I&amp;#39;m like her and basically everyone else that I&amp;#39;m am starting to hate everyone and their little comments I was so upset I type faster than I think and I do read things out of text sometime but I&amp;#39;m am still upset with this give me world and no one wants to work and earn their own way&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: So you think I am lazy because I made a post asking about Christmas lights? I paid for the damn things. Or is it because I stay home with my kids? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If I worked my kids couldn&amp;#39;t go to their IMPORTANT MEDICAL STUFF. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want things given to me. I&amp;#39;d love to work. But my work is here making sure my kids have the best step forward in life they can possibly have. If me trying to find a deal on Facebook is so offensive to you that you feel you need to say you hate me, then maybe you should apologize. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No modifiers. Just an apology would be nice.\\n.......&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No apology ever arrived. Shocker, I know. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So now for the pettiest or revenges.

       "    'selftext': 'Posted this in different sub and was directed here, so a rather long and long-accumulated rant ahead, I apologise. \\n\\nMothers day- MIL already kicked up a fuss, first by insisting it was a week earlier than it really was. Fine, DH took her to dinner then and we thought we were done. Come the actual week, she STILL kept on at DH with \"what are you doing for MEEEE on mothers day?\" Geez woman, he took you to dinner the week before when you insisted it was mothers day. DH wanted to spend the day with just our own family, because it\\'s my first mothers day and tells her as much. \"sorry, but Sunday itself we have our own plans, I\\'ll see you for dinner on Monday.\" Reasonable, right? NOPE. She goes on a tirade about how he\\'s UNGRATEFUL and Monday is NO LONGER MOTHERS DAY and my favourite: \"tell your wife to STOP HER NONSENSE\". (Yes, because whenever DH says no to you, it HAS to be MY fault.) DH, bless him, stood his ground (despite me telling him to just give in to her because I was so tired of the drama) and we spent Sunday on our own and he saw her on Monday (albeit with me in a huge ball of anxiety the whole weekend afraid of what she might pull). \\n\\nMeanwhile, I guess she isn\\'t happy with the fact that DH regularly has dinner with her once every two weeks (he has a demanding job and we have a 6 month old, we Don\\'t have the time or energy for any more of her), because she randomly and regularly blows up his phone with texts along the following lines of : \"be firm with your wife, don\\'t let her control you, don\\'t let her yell at you\" etc, and these come COMPLETELY out of the blue with Zero prior context or link. There\\'s also been  \"If you need to travel for work, Go, your wife should not hold you back, tell her off, you can\\'t be stuck earning X amount forever, and anyway, she has a nanny. I know you can do better.\" \\n\\n SO MUCH there that is absolutely out of line.\\n\\n1. Travel? BOTH DH and I agreed when we got engaged, that neither of us would travel for work. That wasn\\'t the kind of married/family life we wanted, so I quit an extremely good job too because it involved yearly travel. And his job has never involved travel anyway. But all that aside, it\\'s Our decision and Nothing to do with You, so why are you telling him this?\\n2. Absolutely, cloak your insanity in pretending to be concerned about his finances. Meanwhile, this woman earns More than Both my parents combined, and is STILL taking money from DH every month. This knowing that we\\'re now tight with a new baby and its related expenses. \\n3. \"Anyway she has a nanny\"- Wow. So does having a nanny mean he gets to slack off parenting? I have a nanny because I have a full time job. (Unlike her, she did not, And had a nanny, but hey, that\\'s a different story altogether.) And even with a nanny, I do not believe in completely outsourcing the raising of my child, so I bring Both baby and nanny with me to work where I can still be there to keep an eye on things and see my daughter all day. And once we get home, I take over baby because again, it\\'s MY kid. So I still parent much of the day And work And make sure DH\\'s needs are met- dinner is always on the table for him when he gets home for instance. My God, Why do I even feel the need to have to defend myself against such toxicity?\\n4. I am going to assume by \"you can do better\", she was purely referring to his job and earning potential. But somehow, I also do know that she definitely believes he could have \\'done better\\' in other ways too, if you get what I mean.\\n5. The whole strain of general disrespect for his wife. Amazing. And yet, you think I should respect You?\\n\\nWell, now Fathers Day is coming up and you\\'d think we\\'d be safe (she and FIL are divorced and FIL lives continents away). But NO, DH gets a text of \"Sunday is Fathers Day. I\\'m doing lunch. Bring the baby to my house at x time\".\\n\\nExcuse me? Not even \"would you like to come over\"? And who the hell are you to dictate when and where I should bring my baby? And more importantly, WHAT DOES FATHERS DAY EVEN HAVE TO DO WITH YOU?\\n\\nDH tells her No, we have our own plans on the weekend and he\\'ll see her for dinner on Monday as is when they usually meet. AGAIN she throws a HUGE tantrum, sending him unending guilt trip texts when he\\'s AT WORK, Refusing to back down and insisting she wants to SEE THE BABY and that she hasn\\'t seen baby in a long time.\\n\\nRight. Woman, You haven\\'t seen baby in a long time because You got mad at me for setting a perfectly valid boundary (she wanted DH to do her work for her. Literally, what She is PAID to do. DH was busy, she wouldn\\'t take no from him, so I texted her to tell her no) and ceased all contact with me, much less arrange visits with baby. Also, you\\'ve been texting him long strings of text about how he should \\'keep his wife in check\\' and \\'not let her control you\\' etc etc among other things, showing blatant disrespect for me, so why would I WANT you around me much less my child?\\n\\nFinally though, she successfully guilt trips DH into agreeing to a visit this Saturday.\\n\\nDH and I discuss it and set a time for her to come over in the afternoon with limits because we already have plans to work around.\\n\\nCue the following exchange:\\n\\nDH: come over at x time on Saturday then, but we have another appointment at xx time so don\\'t be late (she is HORRIBLE at keeping to set times)\\n\\nMIL: Where are we having lunch?\\n\\nDH: we\\'re not, just come over\\n\\nMIL: but I need to eat. Why are you being this way, and you call yourself a Christian (seriously woman? \"I need to eat\"?? Are you incapable of feeding yourself? Grab a bite before you come over?) \\n\\nDH: lunch period is usually when LO has a nap, so we won\\'t be going out then. You said you want to see LO so come over at that time when she will be awake\\n\\nMIL: I don\\'t need to see LO, just (only) you \\\\[ie, only DH\\\\] will meet me at x place to eat.\\n\\nALL. OF. MY. OH. MY. GODS.\\n\\nSo tired of arguing with crazy that we gave in and DH will meet her for lunch. Way to take your son away from his family on our very precious weekends. AND his first fathers day weekend at that.\\n\\nAnd you Insist on wanting to see LO, we literally ask you to come over, and then you do another 180? My mind.. is just blown.',\n",

Come the actual week, she STILL kept on at DH with &amp;quot;what are you doing for MEEEE on mothers day?&amp;quot; Geez woman, he took you to dinner the week before when you insisted it was mothers day. DH wanted to spend the day with just our own family, because it&amp;#39;s my first mothers day and tells her as much. &amp;quot;sorry, but Sunday itself we have our own plans, I&amp;#39;ll see you for dinner on Monday.&amp;quot; Reasonable, right? NOPE. She goes on a tirade about how he&amp;#39;s UNGRATEFUL and Monday is NO LONGER MOTHERS DAY and my favourite: &amp;quot;tell your wife to STOP HER NONSENSE&amp;quot;. (Yes, because whenever DH says no to you, it HAS to be MY fault.) DH, bless him, stood his ground (despite me telling him to just give in to her because I was so tired of the drama) and we spent Sunday on our own and he saw her on Monday (albeit with me in a huge ball of anxiety the whole weekend afraid of what she might pull). &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I guess she isn&amp;#39;t happy with the fact that DH regularly has dinner with her once every two weeks (he has a demanding job and we have a 6 month old, we Don&amp;#39;t have the time or energy for any more of her), because she randomly and regularly blows up his phone with texts along the following lines of : &amp;quot;be firm with your wife, don&amp;#39;t let her control you, don&amp;#39;t let her yell at you&amp;quot; etc, and these come COMPLETELY out of the blue with Zero prior context or link. There&amp;#39;s also been  &amp;quot;If you need to travel for work, Go, your wife should not hold you back, tell her off, you can&amp;#39;t be stuck earning X amount forever, and anyway, she has a nanny. I know you can do better.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;SO MUCH there that is absolutely out of line.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ol&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Travel? BOTH DH and I agreed when we got engaged, that neither of us would travel for work. That wasn&amp;#39;t the kind of married/family life we wanted, so I quit an extremely good job too because it involved yearly travel. And his job has never involved travel anyway. But all that aside, it&amp;#39;s Our decision and Nothing to do with You, so why are you telling him this?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Absolutely, cloak your insanity in pretending to be concerned about his finances. Meanwhile, this woman earns More than Both my parents combined, and is STILL taking money from DH every month. This knowing that we&amp;#39;re now tight with a new baby and its related expenses. &lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Anyway she has a nanny&amp;quot;- Wow. So does having a nanny mean he gets to slack off parenting? I have a nanny because I have a full time job. (Unlike her, she did not, And had a nanny, but hey, that&amp;#39;s a different story altogether.) And even with a nanny, I do not believe in completely outsourcing the raising of my child, so I bring Both baby and nanny with me to work where I can still be there to keep an eye on things and see my daughter all day. And once we get home, I take over baby because again, it&amp;#39;s MY kid. So I still parent much of the day And work And make sure DH&amp;#39;s needs are met- dinner is always on the table for him when he gets home for instance. My God, Why do I even feel the need to have to defend myself against such toxicity?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;I am going to assume by &amp;quot;you can do better&amp;quot;, she was purely referring to his job and earning potential. But somehow, I also do know that she definitely believes he could have &amp;#39;done better&amp;#39; in other ways too, if you get what I mean.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;The whole strain of general disrespect for his wife. Amazing. And yet, you think I should respect You?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ol&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Well, now Fathers Day is coming up and you&amp;#39;d think we&amp;#39;d be safe (she and FIL are divorced and FIL lives continents away). But NO, DH gets a text of &amp;quot;Sunday is Fathers Day. I&amp;#39;m doing lunch. Bring the baby to my house at x time&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Excuse me? Not even &amp;quot;would you like to come over&amp;quot;? And who the hell are you to dictate when and where I should bring my baby? And more importantly, WHAT DOES FATHERS DAY EVEN HAVE TO DO WITH YOU?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;DH tells her No, we have our own plans on the weekend and he&amp;#39;ll see her for dinner on Monday as is when they usually meet. AGAIN she throws a HUGE tantrum, sending him unending guilt trip texts when he&amp;#39;s AT WORK, Refusing to back down and insisting she wants to SEE THE BABY and that she hasn&amp;#39;t seen baby in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Right. Woman, You haven&amp;#39;t seen baby in a long time because You got mad at me for setting a perfectly valid boundary (she wanted DH to do her work for her. Literally, what She is PAID to do. DH was busy, she wouldn&amp;#39;t take no from him, so I texted her to tell her no) and ceased all contact with me, much less arrange visits with baby. Also, you&amp;#39;ve been texting him long strings of text about how he should &amp;#39;keep his wife in check&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;not let her control you&amp;#39; etc etc among other things, showing blatant disrespect for me, so why would I WANT you around me much less my child?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Finally though, she successfully guilt trips DH into agreeing to a visit this Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;DH and I discuss it and set a time for her to come over in the afternoon with limits because we already have plans to work around.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Cue the following exchange:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;DH: come over at x time on Saturday then, but we have another appointment at xx time so don&amp;#39;t be late (she is HORRIBLE at keeping to set times)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;MIL: Where are we having lunch?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;DH: we&amp;#39;re not, just come over&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;MIL: but I need to eat. Why are you being this way, and you call yourself a Christian (seriously woman? &amp;quot;I need to eat&amp;quot;?? Are you incapable of feeding yourself? Grab a bite before you come over?) &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;DH: lunch period is usually when LO has a nap, so we won&amp;#39;t be going out then. You said you want to see LO so come over at that time when she will be awake&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;MIL: I don&amp;#39;t need to see LO, just (only) you [ie, only DH] will meet me at x place to eat.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;ALL. OF. MY. OH. MY. GODS.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So tired of arguing with crazy that we gave in and DH will meet her for lunch. Way to take your son away from his family on our very precious weekends. AND his first fathers day weekend at that.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And you Insist on wanting to see LO, we literally ask you to come over, and then you do another 180? My mind.. is just blown.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "    'selftext': 'So, long time reader - first time poster. Long post. TL/DR; JNMIL is upset we aren\\'t sending our DS to stay a couple weeks with her over the summer. I\\'m thinking of giving in and letting him go.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI have a reformed JNM who is now 100% JY(!) and my former JYMIL is now an aggravatingly JNMIL.  Make sense?\\n\\nThe important backstory is that when I met D(ear)H 8 years ago, my relationship with my mom was toxic. MIL at the time I met her seemed so JY! I was young and so sweetly naive. Ah, the lack of boundaries I had.... Well fast forward 5 years and my mom goes through some intensive therapy and consciously works on her own shit. It has been amazing. Like, I could actually tell her that I didn\\'t emotionally trust her. She apologized - so many times over the years I\\'ve told her we\\'re absolutely good now. \\\\*\\\\*Go to therapy! It \\'s the dopest of dope.\\n\\nJYMIL takes this same amount of time and basically degrades into a DARVO manipulative succubus.\\n\\nAn important piece of family info here: DH had a 2yo son when I met him. We got married when DS was 3yo. JNMIL up to that point had been the only \"rationally stable\" person in DH life - albeit she lives across the country. DS is the first and only bio grandchild she\\'d had (up until we had a baby this year. woop.). Of course DH is also the GC....\\n\\nConflict started brewing when we would go visit JNMIL on her horse ranch. If I would discipline DS (a toddler misbehaving? never.) She would take him out of time out behind my back and apologize to him for ME. I am DS full time mom and have an awesome bond with the kiddo. He\\'s always been my number one and my motivation. The disrespect was shocking but I let it go as I was still newer to her family. I keep on over the years driving with DH to see her for our summer vacations. Things just subtly downgraded every time with her. She started piling on the emotional baggage. She needed you to know how much of a victim she\\'d been her entire career and life in general. It wasn\\'t enough that she bled out on us adult children though, she started doing it to my DS.\\n\\nSee, that\\'s a problem for me. I cannot stand adults who use children for emotional support. Especially kiddos who\\'ve been neglected and abandoned by their parent. Which DS had been by his bio mom when he turned 5yo. She just up and moved across the country with his half sister. She didn\\'t call for a year. He went through a really rough time and I was the person he had to fall on as the SAHM.... I digress\\n\\nSo time goes on and I bring up to DH every now and again how I have these vague issues here and there. He agrees but neither of us are committed (read lazy) to actually confronting the woman we only see a few times a year. As DS gets a bit older we start letting him go see JNMIL a week ahead of us coming out to visit her. The last couple years we\\'ve let him and his cousin go out and come back without us going at all. This worked because I and DH were working full time. Free two weeks of childcare in the summer is a huge relief.\\n\\nLast year though things came to a bit of a head and I told DH that JNMIL needed some serious boundaries set. He agreed and we drafted a letter to her. It was not received well. She accused me of being a controlling/gatekeeping/GC stealing/ hormonal/ bitch. DH and his slowly shining spine defend me and himself and basically told her to get with the program or kick rocks. We go VLC throughout the year (which, yes I was pregnant with twins at the time.) she and I were completely NC and still are VVVVVVVVVVLC. DH knows I won\\'t let her emotionally unload on our new baby (only one twin survived birth. screw preeclampsia.) and that I\\'m really not interested in DS going to visit JNMIL this summer. I\\'m home full time now so we don\\'t need the help with childcare.\\n\\nJNMIL of course already planned on DS coming to visit and had FIL take two weeks off of work. Did they tell us the dates before hand? Nooope. Just figured we\\'d drive 10 hours round trip to drop DS off with no concern to our own summer plans. Well DH texts her after I said hell no. Let\\'s her know that it\\'s really not going to work out this summer but that she\\'s more than welcome (ugh) to come for a 4 day weekend to see the kids. She\\'s been a little bitchy about it. Brought back up that she forgot she has \"boundaries she\\'s forced to bend to\" (no shit? like, that\\'s how boundaries work..). \\n\\nThe problem I\\'m having here is about DS. He loves his grandma and we\\'ve done a lot to make sure he\\'s had consistent access to her as he wants. This is the first year he won\\'t be going out there in 10 years. Should I suck it up and take him out there? Reestablish the rules with JNMIL and hope for the best?',\n",

       "    'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, long time reader - first time poster. Long post. TL/DR; JNMIL is upset we aren&amp;#39;t sending our DS to stay a couple weeks with her over the summer. I&amp;#39;m thinking of giving in and letting him go.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I have a reformed JNM who is now 100% JY(!) and my former JYMIL is now an aggravatingly JNMIL.  Make sense?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The important backstory is that when I met D(ear)H 8 years ago, my relationship with my mom was toxic. MIL at the time I met her seemed so JY! I was young and so sweetly naive. Ah, the lack of boundaries I had.... Well fast forward 5 years and my mom goes through some intensive therapy and consciously works on her own shit. It has been amazing. Like, I could actually tell her that I didn&amp;#39;t emotionally trust her. She apologized - so many times over the years I&amp;#39;ve told her we&amp;#39;re absolutely good now. **Go to therapy! It &amp;#39;s the dopest of dope.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;JYMIL takes this same amount of time and basically degrades into a DARVO manipulative succubus.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;An important piece of family info here: DH had a 2yo son when I met him. We got married when DS was 3yo. JNMIL up to that point had been the only &amp;quot;rationally stable&amp;quot; person in DH life - albeit she lives across the country. DS is the first and only bio grandchild she&amp;#39;d had (up until we had a baby this year. woop.). Of course DH is also the GC....&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Conflict started brewing when we would go visit JNMIL on her horse ranch. If I would discipline DS (a toddler misbehaving? never.) She would take him out of time out behind my back and apologize to him for ME. I am DS full time mom and have an awesome bond with the kiddo. He&amp;#39;s always been my number one and my motivation. The disrespect was shocking but I let it go as I was still newer to her family. I keep on over the years driving with DH to see her for our summer vacations. Things just subtly downgraded every time with her. She started piling on the emotional baggage. She needed you to know how much of a victim she&amp;#39;d been her entire career and life in general. It wasn&amp;#39;t enough that she bled out on us adult children though, she started doing it to my DS.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;See, that&amp;#39;s a problem for me. I cannot stand adults who use children for emotional support. Especially kiddos who&amp;#39;ve been neglected and abandoned by their parent. Which DS had been by his bio mom when he turned 5yo. She just up and moved across the country with his half sister. She didn&amp;#39;t call for a year. He went through a really rough time and I was the person he had to fall on as the SAHM.... I digress&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So time goes on and I bring up to DH every now and again how I have these vague issues here and there. He agrees but neither of us are committed (read lazy) to actually confronting the woman we only see a few times a year. As DS gets a bit older we start letting him go see JNMIL a week ahead of us coming out to visit her. The last couple years we&amp;#39;ve let him and his cousin go out and come back without us going at all. This worked because I and DH were working full time. Free two weeks of childcare in the summer is a huge relief.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Last year though things came to a bit of a head and I told DH that JNMIL needed some serious boundaries set. He agreed and we drafted a letter to her. It was not received well. She accused me of being a controlling/gatekeeping/GC stealing/ hormonal/ bitch. DH and his slowly shining spine defend me and himself and basically told her to get with the program or kick rocks. We go VLC throughout the year (which, yes I was pregnant with twins at the time.) she and I were completely NC and still are VVVVVVVVVVLC. DH knows I won&amp;#39;t let her emotionally unload on our new baby (only one twin survived birth. screw preeclampsia.) and that I&amp;#39;m really not interested in DS going to visit JNMIL this summer. I&amp;#39;m home full time now so we don&amp;#39;t need the help with childcare.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;JNMIL of course already planned on DS coming to visit and had FIL take two weeks off of work. Did they tell us the dates before hand? Nooope. Just figured we&amp;#39;d drive 10 hours round trip to drop DS off with no concern to our own summer plans. Well DH texts her after I said hell no. Let&amp;#39;s her know that it&amp;#39;s really not going to work out this summer but that she&amp;#39;s more than welcome (ugh) to come for a 4 day weekend to see the kids. She&amp;#39;s been a little bitchy about it. Brought back up that she forgot she has &amp;quot;boundaries she&amp;#39;s forced to bend to&amp;quot; (no shit? like, that&amp;#39;s how boundaries work..). &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The problem I&amp;#39;m having here is about DS. He loves his grandma and we&amp;#39;ve done a lot to make sure he&amp;#39;s had consistent access to her as he wants. This is the first year he won&amp;#39;t be going out there in 10 years. Should I suck it up and take him out there? Reestablish the rules with JNMIL and hope for the best?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "    'selftext': 'My mil is a nutcase. Over the past 6 years, I\\'ve just kind of accepted that she is so outrageously passive aggressive and inappropriate that it\\'s almost an art. I don\\'t have a super close relationship with her, but I do try my best to keep her grandchildren in her life and send pictures and updates and stuff. \\n\\nI have learned to mostly ignore her passive aggressive comments and remarks and her insults thinly veiled as jokes. But there are some occasions where she is just so unnecessarily rude that I have to speak up and stop talking to her. My babyshower was one of those occasions.\\n\\n I had my daughter in early February. Her due date was March 3rd, but because of some seriously scary issues, we decided to take her early. The issues are in my post history if you want to look. Basically a rare, life threatening condition. \\n\\nSo, the shower was planned for late feb by my best friend. She and I have our issues right now, but she went above and beyond to give me a nice shower. I invited mil and she invited one of her friends. cool. So the week before the shower, all of our kids were sick. My newborn was sniffling, my 5 year old had a cold, her 5 year old had a cold, and my step mom was(and still is) recovering from lung cancer treatment. She cannot be around any sick people. We decided to push the shower back a week. \\n\\nI told my mil and she got mad. She decided she was going to do the shower herself and invite all of her friends, on the original date. I told her not to do that and that I wanted to go to my friends shower. She got mad at me, and said she had already invited everyone. I told her I did not ask her to do that, and I am not going. I tried to explain why and she just sighed and rolled her eyes. I actually felt guilty although idk why. \\n\\nThe day of my friend\\'s shower came. MIL decided she was going to attend after all. I was at home getting myself and my kids ready and I get a text from my friend \"Rivsmama please hurry up and get here! Helppp!\" I thought to myself, \"oh shit. mil is there early. \"\\n\\n Apparently mil walked up to the door with her 70 year old friend, holding a cupcake box, and while my friend was trying to help mil\\'s friend get in the door, mil sighed loudly and said \" you\\'re not going to help me carry anything??!\" to my friend. She made a few other rude comments and then stood in friends living room until I got there. I found this out later.\\n\\nI show up, super happy and excited and when I walk in the door, mil makes a comment about me hogging the baby and that she\\'s glad she came all the way here to see everyone else holding her. I ask her if she wants to hold the baby, she rolls her eyes. So I gave her to my sister in law. \\n\\nMy friend is very crafty and made some really cool decorations using felt and baby diapers. I commented on how neat they were and said, \"I wish I had the patience to learn how to do this.\" My mil scoffed and said, \"well you\\'re a mother now, so you need to learn patience. \" I have a 5 year old and 2 older kids, but apparently I only became a mother after my daughter was born idk.\\n\\n Later on, we\\'re playing games and my friend would start a nursery rhyme and the game was you had to finish the lyric, by writing it down. I did pretty well, but had some trouble with a couple. We were all laughing and pretending to cheat and making up silly sentences and just having fun, and my mil pipes up from the corner, \" Rivsmama don\\'t you think as a mother you should know these? Or I guess you just don\\'t sing to your kids. That\\'s nice.\" I ignored her comment and kept talking to the people who actually like me. I\\'d be lying if I said it wasn\\'t wearing me down though. \\n\\nNext, we did presents. This is where shit finally got to be too much. Every present that wasn\\'t clothing, my mil would laugh and ask me if I even knew what the thing was or how to use it. Like I was too stupid to know what a burp cloth or a thermometer was. I tried to ignore her, but I finally got frustrated and said, \"Im not an idiot! Please stop!\"\\n\\nFor weeks, my mil had been hounding me to write thank you cards for all the gifts I got and the gifts I was going to receive. I\\'m not a thank you card type of person, I thought a genuine in person thank you or text was ok, but I was open to the idea at first. Until she started hounding me and insulting me and saying things like you\\'re an adult now, it\\'s time to grow up. And just being super nasty about them. So I go to open her gift, and the first thing was a package of thank you cards. She laughed and said, \"I knew if I left it up to you, it wouldn\\'t have happened. \" And I was pissed. She had treated me like shit at my own baby shower for NO reason and I couldn\\'t take anymore. I tossed the thank you cards to the side and said \" well sorry you wasted your money because I\\'m not sending any goddamn thank you cards!\"\\n\\n And she got red and started to stand up and say something, and my sister in law, who is Puerto Rican and very \"blunt\" as we lovingly describe her, had had enough. She tells mil to sit down and stop being so rude. This was supposed to be my day and she had been mean to  me since I walked in the door. My mil says, \"I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s  \\'daughter\\'s name\\' day, not mine.\" and then she did her passive aggressive laugh and a few minutes later, left. I was about to cry at this point and just wanted her gone. \\n\\nWhen she left, everyone came up to me and asked who that rude lady, bitch, jerk, etc. was and what was her problem? I stopped talking to mil for almost 2 months after the shower. She finally apologized (non apology) and I decided to just move on, and there have been some small issues since, but I\\'m starting to get a backbone with her. It\\'s just growing a little slower than I\\'d like.',\n",

       "    'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mil is a nutcase. Over the past 6 years, I&amp;#39;ve just kind of accepted that she is so outrageously passive aggressive and inappropriate that it&amp;#39;s almost an art. I don&amp;#39;t have a super close relationship with her, but I do try my best to keep her grandchildren in her life and send pictures and updates and stuff. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I have learned to mostly ignore her passive aggressive comments and remarks and her insults thinly veiled as jokes. But there are some occasions where she is just so unnecessarily rude that I have to speak up and stop talking to her. My babyshower was one of those occasions.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had my daughter in early February. Her due date was March 3rd, but because of some seriously scary issues, we decided to take her early. The issues are in my post history if you want to look. Basically a rare, life threatening condition. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So, the shower was planned for late feb by my best friend. She and I have our issues right now, but she went above and beyond to give me a nice shower. I invited mil and she invited one of her friends. cool. So the week before the shower, all of our kids were sick. My newborn was sniffling, my 5 year old had a cold, her 5 year old had a cold, and my step mom was(and still is) recovering from lung cancer treatment. She cannot be around any sick people. We decided to push the shower back a week. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I told my mil and she got mad. She decided she was going to do the shower herself and invite all of her friends, on the original date. I told her not to do that and that I wanted to go to my friends shower. She got mad at me, and said she had already invited everyone. I told her I did not ask her to do that, and I am not going. I tried to explain why and she just sighed and rolled her eyes. I actually felt guilty although idk why. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The day of my friend&amp;#39;s shower came. MIL decided she was going to attend after all. I was at home getting myself and my kids ready and I get a text from my friend &amp;quot;Rivsmama please hurry up and get here! Helppp!&amp;quot; I thought to myself, &amp;quot;oh shit. mil is there early. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently mil walked up to the door with her 70 year old friend, holding a cupcake box, and while my friend was trying to help mil&amp;#39;s friend get in the door, mil sighed loudly and said &amp;quot; you&amp;#39;re not going to help me carry anything??!&amp;quot; to my friend. She made a few other rude comments and then stood in friends living room until I got there. I found this out later.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I show up, super happy and excited and when I walk in the door, mil makes a comment about me hogging the baby and that she&amp;#39;s glad she came all the way here to see everyone else holding her. I ask her if she wants to hold the baby, she rolls her eyes. So I gave her to my sister in law. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My friend is very crafty and made some really cool decorations using felt and baby diapers. I commented on how neat they were and said, &amp;quot;I wish I had the patience to learn how to do this.&amp;quot; My mil scoffed and said, &amp;quot;well you&amp;#39;re a mother now, so you need to learn patience. &amp;quot; I have a 5 year old and 2 older kids, but apparently I only became a mother after my daughter was born idk.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Later on, we&amp;#39;re playing games and my friend would start a nursery rhyme and the game was you had to finish the lyric, by writing it down. I did pretty well, but had some trouble with a couple. We were all laughing and pretending to cheat and making up silly sentences and just having fun, and my mil pipes up from the corner, &amp;quot; Rivsmama don&amp;#39;t you think as a mother you should know these? Or I guess you just don&amp;#39;t sing to your kids. That&amp;#39;s nice.&amp;quot; I ignored her comment and kept talking to the people who actually like me. I&amp;#39;d be lying if I said it wasn&amp;#39;t wearing me down though. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Next, we did presents. This is where shit finally got to be too much. Every present that wasn&amp;#39;t clothing, my mil would laugh and ask me if I even knew what the thing was or how to use it. Like I was too stupid to know what a burp cloth or a thermometer was. I tried to ignore her, but I finally got frustrated and said, &amp;quot;Im not an idiot! Please stop!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For weeks, my mil had been hounding me to write thank you cards for all the gifts I got and the gifts I was going to receive. I&amp;#39;m not a thank you card type of person, I thought a genuine in person thank you or text was ok, but I was open to the idea at first. Until she started hounding me and insulting me and saying things like you&amp;#39;re an adult now, it&amp;#39;s time to grow up. And just being super nasty about them. So I go to open her gift, and the first thing was a package of thank you cards. She laughed and said, &amp;quot;I knew if I left it up to you, it wouldn&amp;#39;t have happened. &amp;quot; And I was pissed. She had treated me like shit at my own baby shower for NO reason and I couldn&amp;#39;t take anymore. I tossed the thank you cards to the side and said &amp;quot; well sorry you wasted your money because I&amp;#39;m not sending any goddamn thank you cards!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And she got red and started to stand up and say something, and my sister in law, who is Puerto Rican and very &amp;quot;blunt&amp;quot; as we lovingly describe her, had had enough. She tells mil to sit down and stop being so rude. This was supposed to be my day and she had been mean to  me since I walked in the door. My mil says, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m pretty sure it&amp;#39;s  &amp;#39;daughter&amp;#39;s name&amp;#39; day, not mine.&amp;quot; and then she did her passive aggressive laugh and a few minutes later, left. I was about to cry at this point and just wanted her gone. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When she left, everyone came up to me and asked who that rude lady, bitch, jerk, etc. was and what was her problem? I stopped talking to mil for almost 2 months after the shower. She finally apologized (non apology) and I decided to just move on, and there have been some small issues since, but I&amp;#39;m starting to get a backbone with her. It&amp;#39;s just growing a little slower than I&amp;#39;d like.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "    'selftext': 'Here’s a (not so) quick recap: \\n\\nHot Lips is my MIL.  She was always overbearing, and nosy, but she became extremely controlling, entitled, obsessive, and passive aggressive after I had my LO almost a year and a half ago.  \\n\\nI’ll provide a few examples of her behavior.  She destroyed our first week home with LO after he was born.  She barged in on me half naked twice when she heard my LO crying and she refuses to apologize for it.  She completely disregarded boundaries we set (no kissing, no social media, etc.), and then insisted those events never happened.  I was so stressed.  I spent most of my time pumping alone so she could be with LO (I had no spine).  \\n\\nShe selected and made LO’s first Halloween costume (a scarecrow) without asking us, and then became angry when DH said we had one selected.  She snoops through our stuff, but says she doesn’t and claims she isn’t nosy.  Though she vehemently denies it, she tries to parent LO (and us), and she calls LO her baby or her son.  She’s obsessed with LO’s development, and tries to compare LO to other babies.  She’s in a one-sided competition with my parents and said something very cruel to my mom.  \\n\\nWe haven’t seen Hot Lips or FIL since before the holidays (when they made their authority figure claims), and they haven’t received any photos of LO in over 6 months (since they told us we had enough pictures of LO and refused to share a video of LO with us).  We recently got the video.  I assume this is because she’s desperate for pictures of LO.  They acted like they just forgot to send it to us.\\n\\nI haven’t responded to any communication since they wished life would go back to the way it was before DH married me.  That’s when I told them they were no longer welcome to stay with us when they visit.  They canceled their holiday visit stating that they forgot to buy tickets, but there is no way they actually forgot.  My best guess is that they’re trying to punish us, and she wants us to beg them to come.  They skipped an annual visit this spring, and didn’t even mention it.  And, MIL sent DH an email informing him that they had no plans to visit us anytime soon!  (Great, thank you.) So, she’s basically punishing herself in an effort to punish us.  She has missed out on a lot of LO’s life all because we asked her to respect our privacy and our common sense boundaries (like no swearing in front of LO), and she doesn’t think she should have any boundaries, so she reacted bitterly, refusing to accept our boundaries, making so many passive aggressive comments that I’ve lost count, and refusing to apologize because she’s done nothing wrong.\\n\\nDH quit video chatting with them a few months ago when Hot Lips asked for parenting feedback she didn’t actually want in a thinly veiled attempt to get pictures of LO.  She got defensive and angry when he gave her feedback, and after a lot of ridiculous emails, she issued a completely fake apology.  \\n\\nShe has since sent me two non-apologies where she expressed regret that I took what they said the wrong way.  She also wrote that I’m important because I’m DH’s wife and LO’s mother (I’m not sure why that was relevant unless she was just looking to insult me).  I think she’s stepping up her efforts to rug sweep because she decided she doesn’t like her current consequences and she wants everything to go back to the way it was (that’s never, ever happening).\\n\\nDH has been texting with Hot Lips and FIL a few days a week, and calling them about twice a month.  They’ve asked to video chat with LO, but DH told them they’re just going to talk for now.  DH didn’t call this weekend, but he did call last weekend.  During these calls, they have not asked about me once.  It’s clear they blame me for this situation and I’m quite certain she wishes I’d just disappear.  It’s infuriating that I’ve overlooked so much of MIL’s behavior, and I’ve been thoughtful, kind, and respectful toward them, and somehow her inability to be a decent human being is my fault.\\n\\nHot Lips and FIL recently got some bad news that they shared with DH via text.  DH responded via text, but didn’t call.  Hot Lips sent the text below this morning.  \\n\\n“We missed talking with you yesterday and we miss seeing OP and LO!!  With all of our bad news recently, it makes us so sad that our relationship is still in the pits.  What can we do?  We love you so much!  Love, your very sad parents. 😢😢”\\n\\nHow would you respond to that?  She’s asked for feedback before.  If DH tells her we need them to respect our boundaries and our privacy, she says that she doesn’t understand why we keep hitting them over the head with our boundaries.  She often ignores questions DH asks, or she reacts terribly, with mean, passive aggressive, and bitter comments, paragraphs about her hurt feelings, and denials about events that happened.  DH wants to respond, and I think he needs to be more direct this time around.  Things will never be the way they were before; they’ve destroyed my relationship with them as well as my opinion of them.  I don’t trust them and I don’t like them.  Only time will improve things, and if she keeps acting like she doesn’t know what happened, then I will never be able to move forward.  \\n\\nThank you for letting me vent, and for your advice.  ❤️',\n",

       "    'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a (not so) quick recap: &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hot Lips is my MIL.  She was always overbearing, and nosy, but she became extremely controlling, entitled, obsessive, and passive aggressive after I had my LO almost a year and a half ago.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ll provide a few examples of her behavior.  She destroyed our first week home with LO after he was born.  She barged in on me half naked twice when she heard my LO crying and she refuses to apologize for it.  She completely disregarded boundaries we set (no kissing, no social media, etc.), and then insisted those events never happened.  I was so stressed.  I spent most of my time pumping alone so she could be with LO (I had no spine).  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She selected and made LO’s first Halloween costume (a scarecrow) without asking us, and then became angry when DH said we had one selected.  She snoops through our stuff, but says she doesn’t and claims she isn’t nosy.  Though she vehemently denies it, she tries to parent LO (and us), and she calls LO her baby or her son.  She’s obsessed with LO’s development, and tries to compare LO to other babies.  She’s in a one-sided competition with my parents and said something very cruel to my mom.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We haven’t seen Hot Lips or FIL since before the holidays (when they made their authority figure claims), and they haven’t received any photos of LO in over 6 months (since they told us we had enough pictures of LO and refused to share a video of LO with us).  We recently got the video.  I assume this is because she’s desperate for pictures of LO.  They acted like they just forgot to send it to us.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I haven’t responded to any communication since they wished life would go back to the way it was before DH married me.  That’s when I told them they were no longer welcome to stay with us when they visit.  They canceled their holiday visit stating that they forgot to buy tickets, but there is no way they actually forgot.  My best guess is that they’re trying to punish us, and she wants us to beg them to come.  They skipped an annual visit this spring, and didn’t even mention it.  And, MIL sent DH an email informing him that they had no plans to visit us anytime soon!  (Great, thank you.) So, she’s basically punishing herself in an effort to punish us.  She has missed out on a lot of LO’s life all because we asked her to respect our privacy and our common sense boundaries (like no swearing in front of LO), and she doesn’t think she should have any boundaries, so she reacted bitterly, refusing to accept our boundaries, making so many passive aggressive comments that I’ve lost count, and refusing to apologize because she’s done nothing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;DH quit video chatting with them a few months ago when Hot Lips asked for parenting feedback she didn’t actually want in a thinly veiled attempt to get pictures of LO.  She got defensive and angry when he gave her feedback, and after a lot of ridiculous emails, she issued a completely fake apology.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She has since sent me two non-apologies where she expressed regret that I took what they said the wrong way.  She also wrote that I’m important because I’m DH’s wife and LO’s mother (I’m not sure why that was relevant unless she was just looking to insult me).  I think she’s stepping up her efforts to rug sweep because she decided she doesn’t like her current consequences and she wants everything to go back to the way it was (that’s never, ever happening).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;DH has been texting with Hot Lips and FIL a few days a week, and calling them about twice a month.

       "    'selftext': 'Isn\\'t it disturbing that some Mean Girls stay that way their entire lives, even at 60+?? It\\'s sad actually isn\\'t it? \\n\\nWe visited MIL and FIL, who dragged us to a dinner party hosted by their friends. MIL has a crew of biddies  (picture stepford housewives but 60+ years old and South Asian). They\\'re a tight-knit group who also gossip about each other constantly (as per FILs and SILs comments). MIL kept hinting to me that this is a \"dressy dinner\". You see, MIL and SIL are very fancy ladies who are always dressed up in sparkles and lots of florals and bright lipsticks and always have 10 layers of makeup on. No judgement, I believe we should all do what makes us feel good, but MIL was clearly worried about my debutante appearance in front of her homegirls. As a side, I think women are beautiful on a spectrum of styles and there is no one definition of femininity. I\\'m a young woman in tech, I love working out and hiking etc, so my style is more laidback and natural. Anyways, DH tells MIL that were not here to get fancy for a dinner party, were here to spend time with them. MIL insisted we must come to this dinner and we have to dress up. Sorry girlfriend, I don\\'t carry such clothes for a weekend family visit and frankly I\\'m not your doll. So I wore black skinny jeans and a nice blouse, did my hair and makeup. My MIL CBF\\'d hard at me, but keep on suckin your lemons lady, you\\'re lucky I\\'m even going to this shindig. \\n\\nHere\\'s the fun part of the story. DH and I drove separately and when we got there, MIL opened the door and rushed me to the garden where the biddies were all hanging out. Y\\'all. I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever been subjected to more Mean Girl attitude in my life. They each had a Sour Lemon look on their face, looked me up and down with what I would describe as disdain and made zero effort to be friendly or welcoming (I felt like I was in a movie, they were so dramatically rude). It became very clear very quickly that MIL has been talking mad shit about me to these ladies. I generally have thick skin and care very little what people I don\\'t know think of me but it was hella uncomfortable so I dipped out of there and found DH. After telling him I\\'m uncomfortable and this is stupid, we told MIL we\\'re leaving (glorious CBF ensues). \\n\\nNext day, I leave to meet a friend in that city for a few hours while DH stays with his parents. In this time, MIL started telling him a \"funny story\" about how one of the biddies is looking for a suitor for her daughter. In MILs culture, parents playing matchmaker is still a thing. MIL and FIL met in school by the way, with no parental interference and she prides herself on being a \"modern lady\". MIL starts telling DH all about the daughter, she\\'s very pretty, working on her masters, understands their culture and .... She told her mom she had a crush on DH. MIL laughs, DH laughs and says that\\'s weird but okay thinking that was it. It wasn\\'t ! The \"funny story\" turns into MIL telling DH that her and biddie were talking about how they wish they could match DH with the daughter and how perfect it would be. Don\\'t you think it would have been perfect DH ??? At this point, DH gets pissed and says I already have a perfect wife and this is weird and walks away. I get home a few hours later and have no idea about this when MIL starts chatting and also tells me the \"funny story\" but more in a \"isn\\'t it so funny this girl has a crush on DH\". We\\'re very secure with each other, so I really didn\\'t think anything of it other than my MIL being her weird self and humored her by saying something about DH being a catch. \\n\\nNow that I\\'m processing this, I realize, it\\'s kinda fucked up no?? Before we met, MIL and FIL tried for years to pressure DH into an arranged marriage because they were afraid he\\'d end up marrying outside their culture and that was MILs biggest nightmare (haha). DH ended up going NC for almost a year after they accused him of being a horrible son for not wanting to marry a stranger just to appease his parents. \\n\\nIts super insulting what MIL said though - hes a married man and she\\'s inviting him to chat about how perfect it would have been to be with someone else instead??? We have a business we\\'ve built from the ground up together, a home, a happy life, but none of it matters because he\\'s not with someone she approved of from her culture. Funny enough, DH and I got engaged after 6 months of dating after I hadn\\'t even met his parents yet since they\\'re far. He doesn\\'t care about her approval obviously. \\n\\nWe only see MIL twice a year for a couple of days and I\\'m already VLC and DH is LC so I\\'m not bothered. But thanks MIL for continuously validating my decision to not have a relationship with you :)\\n\\n\\nEdit : thanks so much for the love and the silver !! Love this safe community!',\n",

       "    'selftext': 'My stepdaughters fist dance is coming up!! Of course that means fights between parents  and kids of dresses and what\\'s appropriate if you have a teenager you know what I\\'m talking about...I have two...(yes I\\'m going gray) the worst fight was with my SD biomom..she had arranged and was trying to force my daughter to go on a date with a boy - no way in f@#$$&gt;; hell ! She will never be pressured to do anything like that, not with anyone, not by anyone. In the end, we won and she is going with my recommendation and going with a group of her girl friends. SD is just in her words not ready to date and was having a panic attack about it. Now she is happy to hang out and be a pretty young lady with her friends.\\n \\nThis reminds me of FFF. \\n\\nIF you have read the past post you can tell what a lovely and attentive mother figure she was....just a peach...- ok so you know she was anything but.\\n\\nWhen it came time to my high school dances I at 16, was well fully grown. I used to play sports and do martial arts so I was in great shape.  Never once had my mother ever taken me shopping, gotten my hair and nails done..make up...nothing. (this is relevant)\\n\\nSo one day when I come home in between school and work she walks up all nice and says oh we need to go shopping and have a girls day...all sweet - it was worse then a horror movie I knew something was up.\\n\\nI asked why? You never want to do that plus I have work and a softball game later.  She tells me we have guest and wants me to look my best. \\n\\nRemember my fellow redditors, I said my stepasswhole was a different ethnicity ... mother fell into his brain washing /mind numbing bullshit. \\n\\nI tell her no thank I have to work and my team needs me (hello short stop and power hitter plus I was trying for a scholarship) \\n\\nI go towards the door and out walks the step jerk and I swear a flock..that\\'s what it looked like of the same ethnicity. (Which I have no problem with that\\'s why I am keeping this as vague as possible) \\n\\nI\\'m stuck as I cant get in the door but this Male in his 30\\'s walks around me like I\\'m some kind of....well like you were inspecting a show horse for sale. I don\\'t like it, I dont like him either he just give me the creeps. \\n\\nThen he looks me in the eyes, sees my Irish furry as he won\\'t let me get by and states.\\n\"So much spirit, it will be fun to break her\"\\n\\nIt clicks in my head...they were trying to marry me off...fuck this..I\\'m American, in America..and I\\'m irish.\\n\\nI spit right in his face and then punch him and knock him out. (Spitting is a severe form of disrespect) and I tell them in their language that my body is not for sale and Irish will never break...we destroy those who dare try to break us.\\n\\nI stepped over his body as he\\'s coming around grab my work stuff and game stuff and run to work. \\n\\nI swore that day no child of mine would ever be forced to do anything she/he  didn\\'t want especially dating.\\n\\nI heard the screaming for days...they had already received money..but they couldn\\'t force me..and since I had made such a show now their name was mud...no one would accept me...or my sisters...or even his own daughter I had ruined the family..\\n\\nI took the punishment, the attempted beatings and they realized they couldn\\'t hurt me anymore physically the did the one thing to make me run away which I will post later.\\n\\nSo I look at my SD smiling and think of what FFF tried to do...and how she will never ruin these moments for my family.',\n",

Of course that means fights between parents  and kids of dresses and what&amp;#39;s appropriate if you have a teenager you know what I&amp;#39;m talking about...I have two...(yes I&amp;#39;m going gray) the worst fight was with my SD biomom..she had arranged and was trying to force my daughter to go on a date with a boy - no way in f@#$$&amp;gt;; hell ! She will never be pressured to do anything like that, not with anyone, not by anyone. In the end, we won and she is going with my recommendation and going with a group of her girl friends. SD is just in her words not ready to date and was having a panic attack about it. Now she is happy to hang out and be a pretty young lady with her friends.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of FFF. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;IF you have read the past post you can tell what a lovely and attentive mother figure she was....just a peach...- ok so you know she was anything but.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When it came time to my high school dances I at 16, was well fully grown. I used to play sports and do martial arts so I was in great shape.  Never once had my mother ever taken me shopping, gotten my hair and nails done..make up...nothing. (this is relevant)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So one day when I come home in between school and work she walks up all nice and says oh we need to go shopping and have a girls day...all sweet - it was worse then a horror movie I knew something was up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I asked why? You never want to do that plus I have work and a softball game later.  She tells me we have guest and wants me to look my best. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Remember my fellow redditors, I said my stepasswhole was a different ethnicity ... mother fell into his brain washing /mind numbing bullshit. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I tell her no thank I have to work and my team needs me (hello short stop and power hitter plus I was trying for a scholarship) &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I go towards the door and out walks the step jerk and I swear a flock..that&amp;#39;s what it looked like of the same ethnicity. (Which I have no problem with that&amp;#39;s why I am keeping this as vague as possible) &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m stuck as I cant get in the door but this Male in his 30&amp;#39;s walks around me like I&amp;#39;m some kind of....well like you were inspecting a show horse for sale. I don&amp;#39;t like it, I dont like him either he just give me the creeps. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then he looks me in the eyes, sees my Irish furry as he won&amp;#39;t let me get by and states.\\n&amp;quot;So much spirit, it will be fun to break her&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It clicks in my head...they were trying to marry me off...fuck this..I&amp;#39;m American, in America..and I&amp;#39;m irish.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I spit right in his face and then punch him and knock him out. (Spitting is a severe form of disrespect) and I tell them in their language that my body is not for sale and Irish will never break...we destroy those who dare try to break us.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stepped over his body as he&amp;#39;s coming around grab my work stuff and game stuff and run to work. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I swore that day no child of mine would ever be forced to do anything she/he  didn&amp;#39;t want especially dating.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I heard the screaming for days...they had already received money..but they couldn&amp;#39;t force me..and since I had made such a show now their name was mud...no one would accept me...or my sisters...or even his own daughter I had ruined the family..&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I took the punishment, the attempted beatings and they realized they couldn&amp;#39;t hurt me anymore physically the did the one thing to make me run away which I will post later.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So I look at my SD smiling and think of what FFF tried to do...and how she will never ruin these moments for my family.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

I don\\'t know that this is the right sub to post in because she isn\\'t a JN in any other situations and not sure that the below qualifies her to be one in these situations.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBUT since we\\'ve had our daughter (almost 3mo) little things are starting to bug me.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* She automatically assumes every single time that DD is hungry that we\\'re giving her a bottle (we had issues in the beginning with weight and latching and my supply, so in the hospital they said we needed to top up with formula after each feed but that\\'s not the case anymore and she\\'s mostly breastfed now) and asks if we have one ready and where it is. The answer is no (because she would normally just go on my boob) and we get called silly or some comment is made about how we don\\'t have one ready and she\\'ll just go off and make one.. I\\'m not super comfortable with breastfeeding in front of others so normally let it slide and just pump once she leaves.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* She smokes. My partner and I don\\'t. Normally when she\\'s over it\\'s not for that long, so to me, it\\'s a matter of just go with smoking for an hour or two. Shouldn\\'t be that hard? Apparently, no. So she\\'ll go outside and have a smoke and come back inside and I hate it for DD, if it was just adults around and no baby I wouldn\\'t care. (My partner and I have spoken about this and we are going to say from now on no one can smoke at our house - my dad also smokes).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnd the one that annoys me the most...\\n\\n* If DD is asleep when she arrives she\\'ll poke and prod her saying something to the effect of \"common, wake up, I want cuddles\". This drives me mad. Especially at the moment when we aren\\'t having many or long day time naps (sleeping like a champ at night though). Like seriously let her sleep! Why on earth wake her up?? She is the first grandchild so I get that she\\'s excited and all those things but yeah still makes me go crazy on the inside.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: the formatting killed my soul',\n",

The answer is no (because she would normally just go on my boob) and we get called silly or some comment is made about how we don&amp;#39;t have one ready and she&amp;#39;ll just go off and make one.. I&amp;#39;m not super comfortable with breastfeeding in front of others so normally let it slide and just pump once she leaves.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;She smokes. My partner and I don&amp;#39;t. Normally when she&amp;#39;s over it&amp;#39;s not for that long, so to me, it&amp;#39;s a matter of just go with smoking for an hour or two. Shouldn&amp;#39;t be that hard? Apparently, no. So she&amp;#39;ll go outside and have a smoke and come back inside and I hate it for DD, if it was just adults around and no baby I wouldn&amp;#39;t care. (My partner and I have spoken about this and we are going to say from now on no one can smoke at our house - my dad also smokes).&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And the one that annoys me the most...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;If DD is asleep when she arrives she&amp;#39;ll poke and prod her saying something to the effect of &amp;quot;common, wake up, I want cuddles&amp;quot;. This drives me mad. Especially at the moment when we aren&amp;#39;t having many or long day time naps (sleeping like a champ at night though). Like seriously let her sleep! Why on earth wake her up?? She is the first grandchild so I get that she&amp;#39;s excited and all those things but yeah still makes me go crazy on the inside.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: the formatting killed my soul&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'This is a story from when I was growing a spine. It\\'s an older one, but I\\'ll share it here for anyone who is shining up their own spine. A motivational missive maybe? I hope you enjoy.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI had a baby. Like you do. It doesn\\'t feel like it was terribly long ago but my kid is over ten so things have definitely changed since then. Back in those days, we didn\\'t have fancy video baby monitors or breathing sensors or any of the amazing fancy things you new moms get these days. We had a simple baby monitor. The base was in the baby\\'s room and the receiver was either in our bedroom or the living room, wherever we were. It was a pretty good monitor, you could definitely hear what was going on in the baby\\'s room... and so our story begins.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy parents were visiting. I didn\\'t know what a JustNo was at that time- I knew my biological father was abusive, hence the restraining orders. But my mom was so much better than him, I didn\\'t ever think to question what she said... until I became a mother. Then all bets were off. I lost my first baby and NOBODY was going to do anything wrong when my son was born. His health and safety came first. Anyway, my JSometimesMom and VeryJustYesSaintofAStepfather were visiting.  My mother had some opinions about our parenting decisions (things had changed since the 70\\'s?!?!? Who would have thought?) but kept them mostly to herself. Until my aunt called her. We were all in the living room and so she took her cell into the baby\\'s room to sit in the rocker and chat. And trash my parenting.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnd so we sat in the living room, my husband and I, (I don\\'t remember where my JYSF was) and heard her make fun of me and my choice of... everything. And how I was overprotective and this and that. It lasted a good 20 minutes. Then she came back, completely oblivious to the fact that we\\'d heard the whole thing. A lifetime of rugsweeping training kicked in and I pretended nothing had happened. More time passed in the visit, she played with the baby, I fed him, my stepfather came back from probably Home Depot. And we were all in the living room when the baby had a blowout.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nDH and I took the baby to his room to change the baby and get the blowout damage under control. And while we were in there, we were very aware that anything we said would be heard over the baby monitor in the living room. Both of my parents would hear anything we said. I can\\'t remember the specifics of what we said, but I know it was in reference to some \"suggestions\" my mother had made that were out of date or wouldn\\'t work for us. We weren\\'t mean or rude- just matter of fact about how it wouldn\\'t work. When the baby was cleaned up, we went back to the living room and were greeted with the biggest, cat-caught-the-canary, smirk on my mother\\'s face. We sat down and she said, \"You should be careful what you say in the room with the baby monitor.\"  \\n\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnd y\\'all. That new mom spine showed up. \"Yes,\" I said. \"We learned that when you were on the phone with Aunt.\"  \\n\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe smirk froze and then in an instant turned to horror.  Horror because her daughter dared talk back to her. Horror because she had been robbed of the gloating that she was so certain she was about to enjoy. But mainly horror because she had been sitting there stewing. And in her mind, she had worked herself up into believing that being overheard on the baby monitor was SHAMEFUL. And anyone who was overheard saying anything unflattering on the monitor deserved to be embarrassed and ashamed. So with that designated as the proper response in her mind, now that she had been caught out for that very thing, she had to be embarrassed and ashamed. And it was awesome. My JYSF chuckled and they left shortly after.   \\n\\n\\nThe end.',\n",

Thank you all for your kind, a little stern words. I hope I won’t have to post in this subreddit again, but I have a feeling I may.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

We haven't seen DH little sister for a while so DH wanted to go. So I figure I can fake liking MIL for a night. \\n\\nWell his sister(17) asked me if I wanted to walk across the street with her to the store to buy a few things. And I ask DH if he would keep an eye on DS( and he said he would. \\n\\n\\nWhen we got back from the store I walk into the house and see DS sitting next to the power outlet pulling on cords that were plugged in and chewing on them. Now he's the part we're I mention he was soaking wet. MIL poured ice chips on the floor for him to play with because she doesn't have AC and it's around 100°. \\n\\nNow i asked nicely (because MIL was right next to him and I'm on the other side of the house ) if she would grab him. Well she looked at him said he's fine he's not in any danger. Well I got PISSEd that she wasnt taking it seriously so I ran to him and I picked him up. And I packed up all of our stuff and we left all without me saying a single word to MIL. \\n\\n\\nMoments later MIL shows up at our house (a 45 minute drive away) to demand I apologize and how I disrespected her in her own house and that I was very rude because she invited us over and bought all the food for dinner. (Which we didn't eat). She always claims that he outlets are surge protector safe. Which means DS wouldn't be able to electricute himself. (I thought load of bullshit but hey I've been wrong before.)  and I explained I wouldn't apologize and that I felt like my son was in danger and that I acted appropriately. And then I asked her to leave. \\n\\nNow my husband is very upset with me for making this all a huge thing and said I should have handled myself better. So I figured I would come here because many of you all understand the justNoMIL stand point and ask you if you all thought I over reacted? \\n\\n\\nAlso I'd like to apologize for how awful this is written I'm currently in my phone and extremely exhausted from today.\",\n",

THEN she shares my social media post as if nothing happened (and has yet to speak to us about it). \\n\\n1. I feel like she called and tried to make it about her, then got upset when she didn\\'t get the response she wanted \\n2. She\\'s getting congratulated left and right on social media, but has yet to congratulate her own son, so I feel like the post was just for attention.\\n3. The REAL reason she didn\\'t know sooner, is because she made my first pregnancy a living hell. She constantly made comments about me not eating enough (not true), she would act shocked when I ate around her, she kept tabs on my prenatal appointment times, and called literal minutes after every single appointment to ask how much I weigh, and shamed me the one appointment I didn\\'t gain weight... I had a melt down in the OB office because of it. My DH telling her \"because I didnt want to\", when she asked why wasn\\'t she told sooner was putting it nicely. \\n \\nI don\\'t want to speak to her. I feel like at this point,  whatever she has to say is fake/forced. She is trying to act like the whole thing never happened. So NOW if we address it, she\\'s going to act innocent.

       "   'selftext': 'To preface, this will be a long one, I\\'ll try to condense as much as possible. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nPrevious to our son being born, my SO and I moved in with his mother at her insistence to start saving for a home. We agreed with a 1-year max goal of purchasing a space of our own. She lives in a very large 6 bedroom house by herself and seemed quite excited to have us join her. We currently occupy the 3 bedroom portion of her basement where we mostly keep to ourselves and leave her to her own routine as often as possible. In exchange for our space, we pay a small amount in rent to help with the electric, etc. bills and I have taken over most of the house and yard duties (I\\'m a SAHM and really don\\'t mind, it keeps me busy). As of a few months ago, my SO and she started disagreeing. Everything from his job, his health, his parenting, his schedule, anything, really. I did my best to stay out of it, mostly because they were being quite petty with one another and I didn\\'t feel the need to interject and cause further drama but in my opinion, she was berating him constantly. Then the small oddities started occurring. Little rules such as no drinking in her home (she never had a problem beforehand and we drink maybe once a month, if at all), not using the dish drying rack (she \\\\*never\\\\* does dishes by the way, I take care of them), not parking where we have agreed to park from day 1, only using very, very specific spots in the fridge and pantry (she also doesn\\'t eat at home that often and has maybe a carton of milk and a few yogurts in the fridge, everything else is preperation items and leftovers from family meals that I make for everyone, including her) . All very weird, petty things that aren\\'t even worth diving deeper into. SO and MIL by this point have had a few extremely heated berating arguments and we were finally told to move out immediately. She \"can\\'t live like this.\" We accepted that we were going to have to use a chunk of our savings for a rental and found something that very weekend. When we informed her of our plans, she apologized and felt horrible that we would be using our funds for a rental instead of towards a home. We all agreed that we should stay. Not even a week later, SO and MIL engage in another heated argument and she threatens to call child protective services because he is abusive (for the record, he isn\\'t abusive IN THE LEAST, not to me, not to our children, he\\'s just fed up with her constant put-downs). This is when I finally started getting involved. When it comes to my children, I will not have someone threatening to have them removed from my custody. In hindsight, I realized later she would have no grounds for such a thing and it would be impossible to actually follow through with, but I digress. Things calmed down once again but only for a moment. While making breakfast for the family, MIL included (this is just days ago), she arrives in the kitchen to start talking down to my SO yet again. He loses it, she leaves the home out of anger, and we are left with PAGES of texts of our abusive behavior towards her and we need to be out of her house immediately (again). For the very first time in the 6 months we have lived there, I stand up for my family. I respond back to her texts with my own choice words of HER abusive behavior towards us. We get home to multiple eviction notices scattered around the home which I promptly gathered and tossed in her room while yelling at her to just leave us alone along with other choice words because by this point, I was incredibly fed up with her and her drama, especially after attempting to forgive her for the Child Protective Services threat. In front of me, she then calls the police and tells them I am threatening violence and trespassing. We gather the children and leave the house immediately. I spoke to the police officer on scene through a phone call and explain what actually happened and that we are rent-paying tenants of her home and will be returning. He agrees that we are allowed to and we go home. It\\'s been a horror show ever since we arrived. We do not have the time, energy, or funds to move out with such immediacy (my god, we need \\\\*at least\\\\* a week to find a rental, not an afternoon). Constant eviction noticed plastered around the home, stomping about whenever we are in the kitchen, blocking my car so I cannot leave, insert a million other passive aggressive actions here. Not to mention, I am no longer allowing her near my children or myself. It\\'s very clear she\\'s mentally unstable and understandably, I don\\'t feel safe around her. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nPhew, that was a mouthful. If you made it this far, bless you, you\\'re a Rockstar Reader. We have no idea how to navigate our living situation while we rental hunt. This person we are living with is a monster. She is abusive, she is aggressive, and now she is making things up to actual police officers in an attempt to have me arrested. I am worried she will succeed, I am worried she will go after my children (I am sending the oldest to stay with my parents in another state until we find a new home, I don\\'t want him near the drama), and I am worried she will damage or alter our things while we are not home. I have gone in and out of crying out of actual shock that a person could do this to someone else they previously (at least, seemingly) cared about. How do we do this?',\n",

I’m mad she threatened him with their relationship over something like this. I’m mad about her comments about me. I’m mad she hasn’t even hinted at an apology to me for the things she said. She will not be welcome in our home for some time. I deserve just as much as my husband to be comfortable in my home and she does not fit into that picture right now. She will also not be seeing myself nor my son for some time. Until she acknowledges what she said and has said behind my back was hurtful and can sincerely apologize.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'So I posted recently about my MIL who was put off by my \"bad energy\" and said she wasnt going to come over to our new house for a very long time. Well that didnt last, shortly after we had a housewarming with my family and invited his as well and she showed up! Kept to herself basically the entire time and didn\\'t engage in any socializing but everyone else had a great time and me and SO  just took it as closing the door on that situation.\\n\\nFast forward to this past weekend, my baby shower. My mom and aunt very graciously planned the whole thing out and it was lovely! The only thorn in my side was that MIL decided not to come. After the housewarming I was feeling good about things moving forward, she had helped us purchase the crib and things seemed to be looking up. Keep in mind that she has known the date, location, etc of the baby shower for months at this point. My mom had made an attempt to involve her in the planning and she told my mom \"no it\\'s okay do what you want\".\\n\\nMe and SO head out towards the shower when he receives a phone call through the Bluetooth system in his car from MIL. Her first question is if we are in the car together, he says yes and they begin speaking in Spanish. Now I wouldn\\'t consider myself exactly fluent but I think they highly underestimate just how much I actually understand. I hear her saying how she doesnt think she\\'s coming. She doesnt know anyone, she has no gifts to bring it\\'ll make her look bad, its too far (my mom lives about 45 minutes away), she\\'ll be the odd one out, amongst other things that I didnt quite catch. He keeps saying \"please come, for me\" she repeatedly says no, they continue this back and forth until she eventually says okay fine. \\n\\nHis summary to me of this conversation was basically \"oh she just feels bad because she doesnt have gifts to bring since shes already given them to us, but she\\'s about to leave\". So now I know that MIL doesn\\'t really want to be there but am satisfied that shes atleast still willing to suck it up and come. We arrive and not 5 minutes later SO gets a text and says \"my mom cant come, she says its raining too hard to drive.\" He accepts this excuse fully however I\\'m confused as to why she would be attempting to leave at the time the shower began and not the 40 minutes earlier she said she was? Me and SO live not 10 minutes from her so we know the weather wasn\\'t bad til later. \\n\\nI brush it off for the moment and enjoy the event. Later on when we head home I mention to him that I did feel hurt that she didn\\'t show up as this is her first grand child and it was important to us. He tries to make excuses for her and confessed that she didnt feel comfortable coming. This struck a cord remembering back to her extreme lack of understanding of my anxiety (see my last post) and the fact that I\\'ve pushed through being uncomfortable for her benefit many times already and had even been considering letting her be in the room for the birth despite having no real desire for her to be there, for my SO and her since it is her first grandchild.\\n\\nAfter this I don\\'t think I want to have her in the room. Her actions are beginning to concern me more for our future relationship and her relationship with my child. Would it be wrong of me to only have my mom and SO in the room?

       "   'selftext': 'My SO has now been dealing with a huge guilt trip shit storm and I\\'m feeling kind of guilty that he has to deal with this. \\n\\nMIL is in full temper tantrum mode. Sobbing, threatening to move far far away, more crying and is now getting FIL to relay her messages because she\\'s just so upset. Unfortunately, the guilt tripping and hearing about her tears seems to be having an effect on SO. For the life of me I can\\'t understand why, it\\'s her same old song and dance that we\\'ve been through many times. \\n\\nThey have accused me of some bizarre and impossible things considering our LO isn\\'t even born yet. Obviously I\\'m going to deny them access to the baby at all costs. I\\'m going to be overbearing and strict about \\'silly things like feeding and naps with the baby\\'. I won\\'t let her have a phone when she\\'s older. I\\'m going to be worse than nephew\\'s mom. Blahblahblah. I don\\'t know where any of this came from because I\\'ve never talked about any of these things with them. \\n\\nI\\'ve received texts saying that I\\'m portraying MIL as a monster, I\\'m wrong. I\\'m being petty and surmising horrible things. I need video evidence of her behaviour.

       "   'selftext': \"This issue was handled already but I am sure it will have long lasting consequences. At least it does for those who are not me, namely the aunt in this story and the Red Rocket.\\n\\nThe same week I went no contact with Red Rocket, actually just a day or two before, I got a text from her sister. It isn’t unheard of for me to get a direct message from the sisters (there are two, they function as a set). But this was different.\\n\\nFor context the first message was accompanied by a picture of my post on a local neighborhood group (that bitch isn’t even supposed to be in because she lives in another state and it is a closed FB group). All I said in the post was that I needed cheap Christmas lights because I was planning to use my MiL’s extra but she had sold them. Also we are atheist and raise our children secularly but Red Rocket has nagged me to decorate our house for Christmas so she can see lights from inside her house. She said it wasn’t fair we could see her lights and she didn’t get the same. I love lights and was all for it.\\n\\nSo, for your reading enjoyment, I give you the time I tried to mitigate the shit Red Rocket says behind my back with the nicer of DH’s two aunts:\\n\\n**Aunt**: Did you see this  give me give me give me I'm like Red Rocket starting to hate her what a brat snot and anything else Why is it we want every thing given to us I'm sorry but that is how I feel and I thought you didn't believe in Santa and the lights and decorations go with Christmas I'm totally confused by you no wonder it is hard\\n\\n**Me**: What? Red Rocket has offered us her extra lights because she wanted us to put lights on our house. She forgot and sold them. I still want to surprise dS1 (and Red Rocket, but I can't put that in a public post that I know she will see) and I want to do it for as cheap as possible. I have bought two sets for $2 from this post so far and found a thrift shop that has them for cheaper than the store.\\n\\nThat's all the post is about. What does your message mean?\\n\\nThis is AUNT, right?\\n\\n**Aunt**: Yes and I don't appreciate you putting she forgot it is only for drama just post you are in need of extra things that is like Taking a jab at her I have to feel for Red Rocket as that would just upset her more She is already torn about leaving adding to her anxiety won't help\\n\\n**Me**: I only put that as an explanation for why I want just running off to buy new at the store. \\n\\nI don't appreciate you assuming that I am jabbing anything at Red Rocket. I am not at all angry with her and I am really heartbroken over her leaving. Before she blew up at me and called me an unfit mother and tried to interfere in my marriage (all that happened out of the blue in two days) I felt like she was a mom to me. We understand that she is homesick and just want her to be happy.\\n\\nI am trying to be as supportive of her decisions as possible and help her get wherever she wants to go whenever she wants, including moving. Every time we are together she talks excitedly about what she imagines her life will be like back in Shittsville and it makes me incredibly sad that she is leaving, but I do not want to punish her for it or have anger in any way. \\n\\nI suspect she is telling you a different version of what life was like here for her to make it easier to come home. \\n\\n**Aunt**:  Not really she is homesick she was too isolated in a big city\\n\\n**Me**: She is telling us that I am too controlling and she doesn't know why DH ever married me. She accused us of allowing the dog to sexually assault DS. She accused me of elder abuse for cursing. She's picking fights to push us away so it is easier for her to move.\\n\\nWe aren't taking the bait anymore (not since the dog incident, since it was so out there we thought it was a joke at first) and are continuing to live peacefully. I know her anxiety is high so we are trying to take her lead on contact so we don't stress her out. \\n\\nI hope you don't believe all that she says about us. The things she says when she is mad indicate that she is saying things about us that may not be accurate when she isn't mad. After your visit she started talking about how her BUSINESS stuff was us taking advantage of her but she always decided where the money went and if we were going to look for STOCK. We didn't take money from it, she decided what it would be spent on. But her feelings towards it seemed to change and we tried to go along with that too. We've tried to accommodate all the projects she has shown interest in.\\n\\nAnyway, frankly, I intend to make sure that I honor my promise to take care of her while she is here and make sure that I support her in her transition. \\n\\nI have pushed fairly hard for her to treat her anxiety because it is driving a lot of her daily life, even in retirement. I hope she finds a path to happiness.\\n\\n**Aunt**:  (no response)\\n\\nOh my god I just re-read the first thing you sent and I realized if I add punctuation it makes sense. And that you didn't mean to send it to me and you are saying you hate me. \\n\\nUm, yeah. Okay. I guess I really do know what Red Rocket says behind our backs.\\n\\n**Aunt**: No I'm saying I'm like her and basically everyone else that I'm am starting to hate everyone and their little comments I was so upset I type faster than I think and I do read things out of text sometime but I'm am still upset with this give me world and no one wants to work and earn their own way\\n\\n**Me**: So you think I am lazy because I made a post asking about Christmas lights? I paid for the damn things. Or is it because I stay home with my kids? \\n\\nIf I worked my kids couldn't go to their IMPORTANT MEDICAL STUFF. \\n\\nI don't want things given to me. I'd love to work. But my work is here making sure my kids have the best step forward in life they can possibly have. If me trying to find a deal on Facebook is so offensive to you that you feel you need to say you hate me, then maybe you should apologize. \\n\\nNo modifiers. Just an apology would be nice.\\n.......\\n\\nNo apology ever arrived. Shocker, I know. \\n\\nSo now for the pettiest or revenges. I continued to gather lights and then hit Walmart to buy strands that specifically did not match what I had already gathered. We did the worst decorating job we could. Strings hung mismatched and limply off the the windows and porch. I pooled a long red strand under the porch to make it look like someone bled out there in glowing lights. But we took all the lights that matched and put them neatly on the inside of the fence so we could see them looking nice, but she couldn’t. She could only see the front of our house and it looked like we tortured elves for fun and led a coup against Santa. \\n\\nWe left the lights up far too long. Red Rocket left 2/20 and we had them up until 3/1. I wanted to take them down 2/21 but it was snowing for a week. I also left them on all the time, no timer. \\n\\nNext year our lights will be amazing.\",\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This issue was handled already but I am sure it will have long lasting consequences. At least it does for those who are not me, namely the aunt in this story and the Red Rocket.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The same week I went no contact with Red Rocket, actually just a day or two before, I got a text from her sister. It isn’t unheard of for me to get a direct message from the sisters (there are two, they function as a set). But this was different.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For context the first message was accompanied by a picture of my post on a local neighborhood group (that bitch isn’t even supposed to be in because she lives in another state and it is a closed FB group). All I said in the post was that I needed cheap Christmas lights because I was planning to use my MiL’s extra but she had sold them. Also we are atheist and raise our children secularly but Red Rocket has nagged me to decorate our house for Christmas so she can see lights from inside her house. She said it wasn’t fair we could see her lights and she didn’t get the same. I love lights and was all for it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So, for your reading enjoyment, I give you the time I tried to mitigate the shit Red Rocket says behind my back with the nicer of DH’s two aunts:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aunt&lt;/strong&gt;: Did you see this  give me give me give me I&amp;#39;m like Red Rocket starting to hate her what a brat snot and anything else Why is it we want every thing given to us I&amp;#39;m sorry but that is how I feel and I thought you didn&amp;#39;t believe in Santa and the lights and decorations go with Christmas I&amp;#39;m totally confused by you no wonder it is hard&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: What? Red Rocket has offered us her extra lights because she wanted us to put lights on our house. She forgot and sold them. I still want to surprise dS1 (and Red Rocket, but I can&amp;#39;t put that in a public post that I know she will see) and I want to do it for as cheap as possible. I have bought two sets for $2 from this post so far and found a thrift shop that has them for cheaper than the store.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all the post is about. What does your message mean?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This is AUNT, right?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aunt&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes and I don&amp;#39;t appreciate you putting she forgot it is only for drama just post you are in need of extra things that is like Taking a jab at her I have to feel for Red Rocket as that would just upset her more She is already torn about leaving adding to her anxiety won&amp;#39;t help&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: I only put that as an explanation for why I want just running off to buy new at the store. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t appreciate you assuming that I am jabbing anything at Red Rocket. I am not at all angry with her and I am really heartbroken over her leaving. Before she blew up at me and called me an unfit mother and tried to interfere in my marriage (all that happened out of the blue in two days) I felt like she was a mom to me. We understand that she is homesick and just want her to be happy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I am trying to be as supportive of her decisions as possible and help her get wherever she wants to go whenever she wants, including moving. Every time we are together she talks excitedly about what she imagines her life will be like back in Shittsville and it makes me incredibly sad that she is leaving, but I do not want to punish her for it or have anger in any way. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect she is telling you a different version of what life was like here for her to make it easier to come home. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aunt&lt;/strong&gt;:  Not really she is homesick she was too isolated in a big city&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: She is telling us that I am too controlling and she doesn&amp;#39;t know why DH ever married me. She accused us of allowing the dog to sexually assault DS. She accused me of elder abuse for cursing. She&amp;#39;s picking fights to push us away so it is easier for her to move.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We aren&amp;#39;t taking the bait anymore (not since the dog incident, since it was so out there we thought it was a joke at first) and are continuing to live peacefully. I know her anxiety is high so we are trying to take her lead on contact so we don&amp;#39;t stress her out. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you don&amp;#39;t believe all that she says about us.

So I pull it out to put it in the right place, and sat it in the living room until taking it to the garage. She threw it away. When I caught it she said I must not have needed it since I “got it out”. She has no concept of things having specific places, so despite her help- I had to move everything she unpacked/ even find everything. \\n\\nAnd then the big one. She sat with him one morning for me to catch a nap and i woke up to her in the living room. I walked past her to get to baby’s room and I could tell she was trying to get there first. Found baby in crib -on stomach, with two blankets. \\n\\nWe’ve been over the rules. She knows them. Because she launched into excuses. “I was closely watching him!” (From a different room?) “it was safe with my kids!” (No, it wasn’t safe then either. Even if they told you that.) “he sleeps better on his stomach!” (Yes, I know. But it’s not about comfort, it’s about safety.)\\n\\nThe the line that pushed too far “please don’t tell on me!” \\n\\nDon’t tell my husband because you know he’ll be mad? We both make the rules.

She has no concept of things having specific places, so despite her help- I had to move everything she unpacked/ even find everything. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And then the big one. She sat with him one morning for me to catch a nap and i woke up to her in the living room. I walked past her to get to baby’s room and I could tell she was trying to get there first. Found baby in crib -on stomach, with two blankets. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We’ve been over the rules. She knows them. Because she launched into excuses. “I was closely watching him!” (From a different room?) “it was safe with my kids!” (No, it wasn’t safe then either. Even if they told you that.) “he sleeps better on his stomach!” (Yes, I know. But it’s not about comfort, it’s about safety.)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The the line that pushed too far “please don’t tell on me!” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Don’t tell my husband because you know he’ll be mad? We both make the rules. She’s just his mom so he gets the honor of talking to her about things like this   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She left while I was at the pediatrician with baby, partially because husband called her and to avoid our anger. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m hurt and don’t know what to do. Are there second chances to things like this? It makes me fearful of what other rules she’ll ignore.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Posted this in different sub and was directed here, so a rather long and long-accumulated rant ahead, I apologise. \\n\\nMothers day- MIL already kicked up a fuss, first by insisting it was a week earlier than it really was. Fine, DH took her to dinner then and we thought we were done. Come the actual week, she STILL kept on at DH with \"what are you doing for MEEEE on mothers day?\" Geez woman, he took you to dinner the week before when you insisted it was mothers day. DH wanted to spend the day with just our own family, because it\\'s my first mothers day and tells her as much. \"sorry, but Sunday itself we have our own plans, I\\'ll see you for dinner on Monday.\" Reasonable, right? NOPE. She goes on a tirade about how he\\'s UNGRATEFUL and Monday is NO LONGER MOTHERS DAY and my favourite: \"tell your wife to STOP HER NONSENSE\". (Yes, because whenever DH says no to you, it HAS to be MY fault.) DH, bless him, stood his ground (despite me telling him to just give in to her because I was so tired of the drama) and we spent Sunday on our own and he saw her on Monday (albeit with me in a huge ball of anxiety the whole weekend afraid of what she might pull). \\n\\nMeanwhile, I guess she isn\\'t happy with the fact that DH regularly has dinner with her once every two weeks (he has a demanding job and we have a 6 month old, we Don\\'t have the time or energy for any more of her), because she randomly and regularly blows up his phone with texts along the following lines of : \"be firm with your wife, don\\'t let her control you, don\\'t let her yell at you\" etc, and these come COMPLETELY out of the blue with Zero prior context or link. There\\'s also been  \"If you need to travel for work, Go, your wife should not hold you back, tell her off, you can\\'t be stuck earning X amount forever, and anyway, she has a nanny. I know you can do better.\" \\n\\n SO MUCH there that is absolutely out of line.\\n\\n1. Travel? BOTH DH and I agreed when we got engaged, that neither of us would travel for work. That wasn\\'t the kind of married/family life we wanted, so I quit an extremely good job too because it involved yearly travel. And his job has never involved travel anyway. But all that aside, it\\'s Our decision and Nothing to do with You, so why are you telling him this?\\n2. Absolutely, cloak your insanity in pretending to be concerned about his finances. Meanwhile, this woman earns More than Both my parents combined, and is STILL taking money from DH every month. This knowing that we\\'re now tight with a new baby and its related expenses. \\n3. \"Anyway she has a nanny\"- Wow. So does having a nanny mean he gets to slack off parenting? I have a nanny because I have a full time job. (Unlike her, she did not, And had a nanny, but hey, that\\'s a different story altogether.) And even with a nanny, I do not believe in completely outsourcing the raising of my child, so I bring Both baby and nanny with me to work where I can still be there to keep an eye on things and see my daughter all day. And once we get home, I take over baby because again, it\\'s MY kid. So I still parent much of the day And work And make sure DH\\'s needs are met- dinner is always on the table for him when he gets home for instance. My God, Why do I even feel the need to have to defend myself against such toxicity?\\n4. I am going to assume by \"you can do better\", she was purely referring to his job and earning potential. But somehow, I also do know that she definitely believes he could have \\'done better\\' in other ways too, if you get what I mean.\\n5. The whole strain of general disrespect for his wife. Amazing. And yet, you think I should respect You?\\n\\nWell, now Fathers Day is coming up and you\\'d think we\\'d be safe (she and FIL are divorced and FIL lives continents away). But NO, DH gets a text of \"Sunday is Fathers Day. I\\'m doing lunch. Bring the baby to my house at x time\".\\n\\nExcuse me? Not even \"would you like to come over\"? And who the hell are you to dictate when and where I should bring my baby? And more importantly, WHAT DOES FATHERS DAY EVEN HAVE TO DO WITH YOU?\\n\\nDH tells her No, we have our own plans on the weekend and he\\'ll see her for dinner on Monday as is when they usually meet. AGAIN she throws a HUGE tantrum, sending him unending guilt trip texts when he\\'s AT WORK, Refusing to back down and insisting she wants to SEE THE BABY and that she hasn\\'t seen baby in a long time.\\n\\nRight. Woman, You haven\\'t seen baby in a long time because You got mad at me for setting a perfectly valid boundary (she wanted DH to do her work for her. Literally, what She is PAID to do. DH was busy, she wouldn\\'t take no from him, so I texted her to tell her no) and ceased all contact with me, much less arrange visits with baby. Also, you\\'ve been texting him long strings of text about how he should \\'keep his wife in check\\' and \\'not let her control you\\' etc etc among other things, showing blatant disrespect for me, so why would I WANT you around me much less my child?\\n\\nFinally though, she successfully guilt trips DH into agreeing to a visit this Saturday.\\n\\nDH and I discuss it and set a time for her to come over in the afternoon with limits because we already have plans to work around.\\n\\nCue the following exchange:\\n\\nDH: come over at x time on Saturday then, but we have another appointment at xx time so don\\'t be late (she is HORRIBLE at keeping to set times)\\n\\nMIL: Where are we having lunch?\\n\\nDH: we\\'re not, just come over\\n\\nMIL: but I need to eat. Why are you being this way, and you call yourself a Christian (seriously woman? \"I need to eat\"?? Are you incapable of feeding yourself? Grab a bite before you come over?) \\n\\nDH: lunch period is usually when LO has a nap, so we won\\'t be going out then. You said you want to see LO so come over at that time when she will be awake\\n\\nMIL: I don\\'t need to see LO, just (only) you \\\\[ie, only DH\\\\] will meet me at x place to eat.\\n\\nALL. OF. MY. OH. MY. GODS.\\n\\nSo tired of arguing with crazy that we gave in and DH will meet her for lunch. Way to take your son away from his family on our very precious weekends. AND his first fathers day weekend at that.\\n\\nAnd you Insist on wanting to see LO, we literally ask you to come over, and then you do another 180? My mind.. is just blown.',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posted this in different sub and was directed here, so a rather long and long-accumulated rant ahead, I apologise. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mothers day- MIL already kicked up a fuss, first by insisting it was a week earlier than it really was. Fine, DH took her to dinner then and we thought we were done. Come the actual week, she STILL kept on at DH with &amp;quot;what are you doing for MEEEE on mothers day?&amp;quot; Geez woman, he took you to dinner the week before when you insisted it was mothers day. DH wanted to spend the day with just our own family, because it&amp;#39;s my first mothers day and tells her as much. &amp;quot;sorry, but Sunday itself we have our own plans, I&amp;#39;ll see you for dinner on Monday.&amp;quot; Reasonable, right? NOPE. She goes on a tirade about how he&amp;#39;s UNGRATEFUL and Monday is NO LONGER MOTHERS DAY and my favourite: &amp;quot;tell your wife to STOP HER NONSENSE&amp;quot;. (Yes, because whenever DH says no to you, it HAS to be MY fault.) DH, bless him, stood his ground (despite me telling him to just give in to her because I was so tired of the drama) and we spent Sunday on our own and he saw her on Monday (albeit with me in a huge ball of anxiety the whole weekend afraid of what she might pull). &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I guess she isn&amp;#39;t happy with the fact that DH regularly has dinner with her once every two weeks (he has a demanding job and we have a 6 month old, we Don&amp;#39;t have the time or energy for any more of her), because she randomly and regularly blows up his phone with texts along the following lines of : &amp;quot;be firm with your wife, don&amp;#39;t let her control you, don&amp;#39;t let her yell at you&amp;quot; etc, and these come COMPLETELY out of the blue with Zero prior context or link. There&amp;#39;s also been  &amp;quot;If you need to travel for work, Go, your wife should not hold you back, tell her off, you can&amp;#39;t be stuck earning X amount forever, and anyway, she has a nanny. I know you can do better.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;SO MUCH there that is absolutely out of line.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ol&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Travel? BOTH DH and I agreed when we got engaged, that neither of us would travel for work. That wasn&amp;#39;t the kind of married/family life we wanted, so I quit an extremely good job too because it involved yearly travel. And his job has never involved travel anyway. But all that aside, it&amp;#39;s Our decision and Nothing to do with You, so why are you telling him this?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Absolutely, cloak your insanity in pretending to be concerned about his finances. Meanwhile, this woman earns More than Both my parents combined, and is STILL taking money from DH every month. This knowing that we&amp;#39;re now tight with a new baby and its related expenses. &lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Anyway she has a nanny&amp;quot;- Wow. So does having a nanny mean he gets to slack off parenting? I have a nanny because I have a full time job. (Unlike her, she did not, And had a nanny, but hey, that&amp;#39;s a different story altogether.) And even with a nanny, I do not believe in completely outsourcing the raising of my child, so I bring Both baby and nanny with me to work where I can still be there to keep an eye on things and see my daughter all day. And once we get home, I take over baby because again, it&amp;#39;s MY kid. So I still parent much of the day And work And make sure DH&amp;#39;s needs are met- dinner is always on the table for him when he gets home for instance. My God, Why do I even feel the need to have to defend myself against such toxicity?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;I am going to assume by &amp;quot;you can do better&amp;quot;, she was purely referring to his job and earning potential. But somehow, I also do know that she definitely believes he could have &amp;#39;done better&amp;#39; in other ways too, if you get what I mean.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;The whole strain of general disrespect for his wife. Amazing. And yet, you think I should respect You?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ol&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Well, now Fathers Day is coming up and you&amp;#39;d think we&amp;#39;d be safe (she and FIL are divorced and FIL lives continents away). But NO, DH gets a text of &amp;quot;Sunday is Fathers Day. I&amp;#39;m doing lunch. Bring the baby to my house at x time&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Excuse me? Not even &amp;quot;would you like to come over&amp;quot;? And who the hell are you to dictate when and where I should bring my baby? And more importantly, WHAT DOES FATHERS DAY EVEN HAVE TO DO WITH YOU?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;DH tells her No, we have our own plans on the weekend and he&amp;#39;ll see her for dinner on Monday as is when they usually meet. AGAIN she throws a HUGE tantrum, sending him unending guilt trip texts when he&amp;#39;s AT WORK, Refusing to back down and insisting she wants to SEE THE BABY and that she hasn&amp;#39;t seen baby in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Right. Woman, You haven&amp;#39;t seen baby in a long time because You got mad at me for setting a perfectly valid boundary (she wanted DH to do her work for her. Literally, what She is PAID to do. DH was busy, she wouldn&amp;#39;t take no from him, so I texted her to tell her no) and ceased all contact with me, much less arrange visits with baby. Also, you&amp;#39;ve been texting him long strings of text about how he should &amp;#39;keep his wife in check&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;not let her control you&amp;#39; etc etc among other things, showing blatant disrespect for me, so why would I WANT you around me much less my child?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Finally though, she successfully guilt trips DH into agreeing to a visit this Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;DH and I discuss it and set a time for her to come over in the afternoon with limits because we already have plans to work around.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Cue the following exchange:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;DH: come over at x time on Saturday then, but we have another appointment at xx time so don&amp;#39;t be late (she is HORRIBLE at keeping to set times)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;MIL: Where are we having lunch?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;DH: we&amp;#39;re not, just come over&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;MIL: but I need to eat. Why are you being this way, and you call yourself a Christian (seriously woman? &amp;quot;I need to eat&amp;quot;?? Are you incapable of feeding yourself? Grab a bite before you come over?) &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;DH: lunch period is usually when LO has a nap, so we won&amp;#39;t be going out then. You said you want to see LO so come over at that time when she will be awake&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;MIL: I don&amp;#39;t need to see LO, just (only) you [ie, only DH] will meet me at x place to eat.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;ALL. OF. MY. OH. MY. GODS.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So tired of arguing with crazy that we gave in and DH will meet her for lunch. Way to take your son away from his family on our very precious weekends. AND his first fathers day weekend at that.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And you Insist on wanting to see LO, we literally ask you to come over, and then you do another 180? My mind.. is just blown.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'So, long time reader - first time poster. Long post. TL/DR; JNMIL is upset we aren\\'t sending our DS to stay a couple weeks with her over the summer. I\\'m thinking of giving in and letting him go.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI have a reformed JNM who is now 100% JY(!) and my former JYMIL is now an aggravatingly JNMIL.  Make sense?\\n\\nThe important backstory is that when I met D(ear)H 8 years ago, my relationship with my mom was toxic. MIL at the time I met her seemed so JY! I was young and so sweetly naive. Ah, the lack of boundaries I had.... Well fast forward 5 years and my mom goes through some intensive therapy and consciously works on her own shit. It has been amazing. Like, I could actually tell her that I didn\\'t emotionally trust her. She apologized - so many times over the years I\\'ve told her we\\'re absolutely good now. \\\\*\\\\*Go to therapy! It \\'s the dopest of dope.\\n\\nJYMIL takes this same amount of time and basically degrades into a DARVO manipulative succubus.\\n\\nAn important piece of family info here: DH had a 2yo son when I met him. We got married when DS was 3yo. JNMIL up to that point had been the only \"rationally stable\" person in DH life - albeit she lives across the country. DS is the first and only bio grandchild she\\'d had (up until we had a baby this year. woop.). Of course DH is also the GC....\\n\\nConflict started brewing when we would go visit JNMIL on her horse ranch. If I would discipline DS (a toddler misbehaving? never.) She would take him out of time out behind my back and apologize to him for ME. I am DS full time mom and have an awesome bond with the kiddo. He\\'s always been my number one and my motivation. The disrespect was shocking but I let it go as I was still newer to her family. I keep on over the years driving with DH to see her for our summer vacations. Things just subtly downgraded every time with her. She started piling on the emotional baggage. She needed you to know how much of a victim she\\'d been her entire career and life in general. It wasn\\'t enough that she bled out on us adult children though, she started doing it to my DS.\\n\\nSee, that\\'s a problem for me. I cannot stand adults who use children for emotional support. Especially kiddos who\\'ve been neglected and abandoned by their parent. Which DS had been by his bio mom when he turned 5yo. She just up and moved across the country with his half sister. She didn\\'t call for a year. He went through a really rough time and I was the person he had to fall on as the SAHM.... I digress\\n\\nSo time goes on and I bring up to DH every now and again how I have these vague issues here and there. He agrees but neither of us are committed (read lazy) to actually confronting the woman we only see a few times a year. As DS gets a bit older we start letting him go see JNMIL a week ahead of us coming out to visit her. The last couple years we\\'ve let him and his cousin go out and come back without us going at all. This worked because I and DH were working full time. Free two weeks of childcare in the summer is a huge relief.\\n\\nLast year though things came to a bit of a head and I told DH that JNMIL needed some serious boundaries set. He agreed and we drafted a letter to her. It was not received well. She accused me of being a controlling/gatekeeping/GC stealing/ hormonal/ bitch. DH and his slowly shining spine defend me and himself and basically told her to get with the program or kick rocks. We go VLC throughout the year (which, yes I was pregnant with twins at the time.) she and I were completely NC and still are VVVVVVVVVVLC. DH knows I won\\'t let her emotionally unload on our new baby (only one twin survived birth. screw preeclampsia.) and that I\\'m really not interested in DS going to visit JNMIL this summer. I\\'m home full time now so we don\\'t need the help with childcare.\\n\\nJNMIL of course already planned on DS coming to visit and had FIL take two weeks off of work. Did they tell us the dates before hand? Nooope. Just figured we\\'d drive 10 hours round trip to drop DS off with no concern to our own summer plans. Well DH texts her after I said hell no. Let\\'s her know that it\\'s really not going to work out this summer but that she\\'s more than welcome (ugh) to come for a 4 day weekend to see the kids. She\\'s been a little bitchy about it. Brought back up that she forgot she has \"boundaries she\\'s forced to bend to\" (no shit? like, that\\'s how boundaries work..). \\n\\nThe problem I\\'m having here is about DS. He loves his grandma and we\\'ve done a lot to make sure he\\'s had consistent access to her as he wants. This is the first year he won\\'t be going out there in 10 years. Should I suck it up and take him out there? Reestablish the rules with JNMIL and hope for the best?',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, long time reader - first time poster. Long post. TL/DR; JNMIL is upset we aren&amp;#39;t sending our DS to stay a couple weeks with her over the summer. I&amp;#39;m thinking of giving in and letting him go.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I have a reformed JNM who is now 100% JY(!) and my former JYMIL is now an aggravatingly JNMIL.  Make sense?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The important backstory is that when I met D(ear)H 8 years ago, my relationship with my mom was toxic. MIL at the time I met her seemed so JY! I was young and so sweetly naive. Ah, the lack of boundaries I had.... Well fast forward 5 years and my mom goes through some intensive therapy and consciously works on her own shit. It has been amazing. Like, I could actually tell her that I didn&amp;#39;t emotionally trust her. She apologized - so many times over the years I&amp;#39;ve told her we&amp;#39;re absolutely good now. **Go to therapy! It &amp;#39;s the dopest of dope.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;JYMIL takes this same amount of time and basically degrades into a DARVO manipulative succubus.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;An important piece of family info here: DH had a 2yo son when I met him. We got married when DS was 3yo. JNMIL up to that point had been the only &amp;quot;rationally stable&amp;quot; person in DH life - albeit she lives across the country. DS is the first and only bio grandchild she&amp;#39;d had (up until we had a baby this year. woop.). Of course DH is also the GC....&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Conflict started brewing when we would go visit JNMIL on her horse ranch. If I would discipline DS (a toddler misbehaving? never.) She would take him out of time out behind my back and apologize to him for ME. I am DS full time mom and have an awesome bond with the kiddo. He&amp;#39;s always been my number one and my motivation. The disrespect was shocking but I let it go as I was still newer to her family. I keep on over the years driving with DH to see her for our summer vacations. Things just subtly downgraded every time with her. She started piling on the emotional baggage. She needed you to know how much of a victim she&amp;#39;d been her entire career and life in general. It wasn&amp;#39;t enough that she bled out on us adult children though, she started doing it to my DS.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;See, that&amp;#39;s a problem for me. I cannot stand adults who use children for emotional support. Especially kiddos who&amp;#39;ve been neglected and abandoned by their parent. Which DS had been by his bio mom when he turned 5yo. She just up and moved across the country with his half sister. She didn&amp;#39;t call for a year. He went through a really rough time and I was the person he had to fall on as the SAHM.... I digress&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So time goes on and I bring up to DH every now and again how I have these vague issues here and there. He agrees but neither of us are committed (read lazy) to actually confronting the woman we only see a few times a year. As DS gets a bit older we start letting him go see JNMIL a week ahead of us coming out to visit her. The last couple years we&amp;#39;ve let him and his cousin go out and come back without us going at all. This worked because I and DH were working full time. Free two weeks of childcare in the summer is a huge relief.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Last year though things came to a bit of a head and I told DH that JNMIL needed some serious boundaries set. He agreed and we drafted a letter to her. It was not received well. She accused me of being a controlling/gatekeeping/GC stealing/ hormonal/ bitch. DH and his slowly shining spine defend me and himself and basically told her to get with the program or kick rocks. We go VLC throughout the year (which, yes I was pregnant with twins at the time.) she and I were completely NC and still are VVVVVVVVVVLC. DH knows I won&amp;#39;t let her emotionally unload on our new baby (only one twin survived birth. screw preeclampsia.) and that I&amp;#39;m really not interested in DS going to visit JNMIL this summer. I&amp;#39;m home full time now so we don&amp;#39;t need the help with childcare.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;JNMIL of course already planned on DS coming to visit and had FIL take two weeks off of work. Did they tell us the dates before hand? Nooope. Just figured we&amp;#39;d drive 10 hours round trip to drop DS off with no concern to our own summer plans. Well DH texts her after I said hell no. Let&amp;#39;s her know that it&amp;#39;s really not going to work out this summer but that she&amp;#39;s more than welcome (ugh) to come for a 4 day weekend to see the kids. She&amp;#39;s been a little bitchy about it. Brought back up that she forgot she has &amp;quot;boundaries she&amp;#39;s forced to bend to&amp;quot; (no shit? like, that&amp;#39;s how boundaries work..). &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The problem I&amp;#39;m having here is about DS. He loves his grandma and we&amp;#39;ve done a lot to make sure he&amp;#39;s had consistent access to her as he wants. This is the first year he won&amp;#39;t be going out there in 10 years. Should I suck it up and take him out there? Reestablish the rules with JNMIL and hope for the best?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'My mil is a nutcase. Over the past 6 years, I\\'ve just kind of accepted that she is so outrageously passive aggressive and inappropriate that it\\'s almost an art. I don\\'t have a super close relationship with her, but I do try my best to keep her grandchildren in her life and send pictures and updates and stuff. \\n\\nI have learned to mostly ignore her passive aggressive comments and remarks and her insults thinly veiled as jokes. But there are some occasions where she is just so unnecessarily rude that I have to speak up and stop talking to her. My babyshower was one of those occasions.\\n\\n I had my daughter in early February. Her due date was March 3rd, but because of some seriously scary issues, we decided to take her early. The issues are in my post history if you want to look. Basically a rare, life threatening condition. \\n\\nSo, the shower was planned for late feb by my best friend. She and I have our issues right now, but she went above and beyond to give me a nice shower. I invited mil and she invited one of her friends. cool. So the week before the shower, all of our kids were sick. My newborn was sniffling, my 5 year old had a cold, her 5 year old had a cold, and my step mom was(and still is) recovering from lung cancer treatment. She cannot be around any sick people. We decided to push the shower back a week. \\n\\nI told my mil and she got mad. She decided she was going to do the shower herself and invite all of her friends, on the original date. I told her not to do that and that I wanted to go to my friends shower. She got mad at me, and said she had already invited everyone. I told her I did not ask her to do that, and I am not going. I tried to explain why and she just sighed and rolled her eyes. I actually felt guilty although idk why. \\n\\nThe day of my friend\\'s shower came. MIL decided she was going to attend after all. I was at home getting myself and my kids ready and I get a text from my friend \"Rivsmama please hurry up and get here! Helppp!\" I thought to myself, \"oh shit. mil is there early. \"\\n\\n Apparently mil walked up to the door with her 70 year old friend, holding a cupcake box, and while my friend was trying to help mil\\'s friend get in the door, mil sighed loudly and said \" you\\'re not going to help me carry anything??!\" to my friend. She made a few other rude comments and then stood in friends living room until I got there. I found this out later.\\n\\nI show up, super happy and excited and when I walk in the door, mil makes a comment about me hogging the baby and that she\\'s glad she came all the way here to see everyone else holding her. I ask her if she wants to hold the baby, she rolls her eyes. So I gave her to my sister in law. \\n\\nMy friend is very crafty and made some really cool decorations using felt and baby diapers. I commented on how neat they were and said, \"I wish I had the patience to learn how to do this.\" My mil scoffed and said, \"well you\\'re a mother now, so you need to learn patience. \" I have a 5 year old and 2 older kids, but apparently I only became a mother after my daughter was born idk.\\n\\n Later on, we\\'re playing games and my friend would start a nursery rhyme and the game was you had to finish the lyric, by writing it down. I did pretty well, but had some trouble with a couple. We were all laughing and pretending to cheat and making up silly sentences and just having fun, and my mil pipes up from the corner, \" Rivsmama don\\'t you think as a mother you should know these? Or I guess you just don\\'t sing to your kids. That\\'s nice.\" I ignored her comment and kept talking to the people who actually like me. I\\'d be lying if I said it wasn\\'t wearing me down though. \\n\\nNext, we did presents. This is where shit finally got to be too much. Every present that wasn\\'t clothing, my mil would laugh and ask me if I even knew what the thing was or how to use it. Like I was too stupid to know what a burp cloth or a thermometer was. I tried to ignore her, but I finally got frustrated and said, \"Im not an idiot! Please stop!\"\\n\\nFor weeks, my mil had been hounding me to write thank you cards for all the gifts I got and the gifts I was going to receive. I\\'m not a thank you card type of person, I thought a genuine in person thank you or text was ok, but I was open to the idea at first. Until she started hounding me and insulting me and saying things like you\\'re an adult now, it\\'s time to grow up. And just being super nasty about them. So I go to open her gift, and the first thing was a package of thank you cards. She laughed and said, \"I knew if I left it up to you, it wouldn\\'t have happened. \" And I was pissed. She had treated me like shit at my own baby shower for NO reason and I couldn\\'t take anymore. I tossed the thank you cards to the side and said \" well sorry you wasted your money because I\\'m not sending any goddamn thank you cards!\"\\n\\n And she got red and started to stand up and say something, and my sister in law, who is Puerto Rican and very \"blunt\" as we lovingly describe her, had had enough. She tells mil to sit down and stop being so rude. This was supposed to be my day and she had been mean to  me since I walked in the door. My mil says, \"I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s  \\'daughter\\'s name\\' day, not mine.\" and then she did her passive aggressive laugh and a few minutes later, left. I was about to cry at this point and just wanted her gone. \\n\\nWhen she left, everyone came up to me and asked who that rude lady, bitch, jerk, etc. was and what was her problem? I stopped talking to mil for almost 2 months after the shower. She finally apologized (non apology) and I decided to just move on, and there have been some small issues since, but I\\'m starting to get a backbone with her. It\\'s just growing a little slower than I\\'d like.',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mil is a nutcase. Over the past 6 years, I&amp;#39;ve just kind of accepted that she is so outrageously passive aggressive and inappropriate that it&amp;#39;s almost an art. I don&amp;#39;t have a super close relationship with her, but I do try my best to keep her grandchildren in her life and send pictures and updates and stuff. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I have learned to mostly ignore her passive aggressive comments and remarks and her insults thinly veiled as jokes. But there are some occasions where she is just so unnecessarily rude that I have to speak up and stop talking to her. My babyshower was one of those occasions.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had my daughter in early February. Her due date was March 3rd, but because of some seriously scary issues, we decided to take her early. The issues are in my post history if you want to look. Basically a rare, life threatening condition. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So, the shower was planned for late feb by my best friend. She and I have our issues right now, but she went above and beyond to give me a nice shower. I invited mil and she invited one of her friends. cool. So the week before the shower, all of our kids were sick. My newborn was sniffling, my 5 year old had a cold, her 5 year old had a cold, and my step mom was(and still is) recovering from lung cancer treatment. She cannot be around any sick people. We decided to push the shower back a week. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I told my mil and she got mad. She decided she was going to do the shower herself and invite all of her friends, on the original date. I told her not to do that and that I wanted to go to my friends shower. She got mad at me, and said she had already invited everyone. I told her I did not ask her to do that, and I am not going. I tried to explain why and she just sighed and rolled her eyes. I actually felt guilty although idk why. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The day of my friend&amp;#39;s shower came. MIL decided she was going to attend after all. I was at home getting myself and my kids ready and I get a text from my friend &amp;quot;Rivsmama please hurry up and get here! Helppp!&amp;quot; I thought to myself, &amp;quot;oh shit. mil is there early. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently mil walked up to the door with her 70 year old friend, holding a cupcake box, and while my friend was trying to help mil&amp;#39;s friend get in the door, mil sighed loudly and said &amp;quot; you&amp;#39;re not going to help me carry anything??!&amp;quot; to my friend. She made a few other rude comments and then stood in friends living room until I got there. I found this out later.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I show up, super happy and excited and when I walk in the door, mil makes a comment about me hogging the baby and that she&amp;#39;s glad she came all the way here to see everyone else holding her. I ask her if she wants to hold the baby, she rolls her eyes. So I gave her to my sister in law. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My friend is very crafty and made some really cool decorations using felt and baby diapers. I commented on how neat they were and said, &amp;quot;I wish I had the patience to learn how to do this.&amp;quot; My mil scoffed and said, &amp;quot;well you&amp;#39;re a mother now, so you need to learn patience. &amp;quot; I have a 5 year old and 2 older kids, but apparently I only became a mother after my daughter was born idk.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Later on, we&amp;#39;re playing games and my friend would start a nursery rhyme and the game was you had to finish the lyric, by writing it down. I did pretty well, but had some trouble with a couple. We were all laughing and pretending to cheat and making up silly sentences and just having fun, and my mil pipes up from the corner, &amp;quot; Rivsmama don&amp;#39;t you think as a mother you should know these? Or I guess you just don&amp;#39;t sing to your kids. That&amp;#39;s nice.&amp;quot; I ignored her comment and kept talking to the people who actually like me. I&amp;#39;d be lying if I said it wasn&amp;#39;t wearing me down though. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Next, we did presents. This is where shit finally got to be too much. Every present that wasn&amp;#39;t clothing, my mil would laugh and ask me if I even knew what the thing was or how to use it. Like I was too stupid to know what a burp cloth or a thermometer was. I tried to ignore her, but I finally got frustrated and said, &amp;quot;Im not an idiot! Please stop!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For weeks, my mil had been hounding me to write thank you cards for all the gifts I got and the gifts I was going to receive. I&amp;#39;m not a thank you card type of person, I thought a genuine in person thank you or text was ok, but I was open to the idea at first. Until she started hounding me and insulting me and saying things like you&amp;#39;re an adult now, it&amp;#39;s time to grow up. And just being super nasty about them. So I go to open her gift, and the first thing was a package of thank you cards. She laughed and said, &amp;quot;I knew if I left it up to you, it wouldn&amp;#39;t have happened. &amp;quot; And I was pissed. She had treated me like shit at my own baby shower for NO reason and I couldn&amp;#39;t take anymore. I tossed the thank you cards to the side and said &amp;quot; well sorry you wasted your money because I&amp;#39;m not sending any goddamn thank you cards!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And she got red and started to stand up and say something, and my sister in law, who is Puerto Rican and very &amp;quot;blunt&amp;quot; as we lovingly describe her, had had enough. She tells mil to sit down and stop being so rude. This was supposed to be my day and she had been mean to  me since I walked in the door. My mil says, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m pretty sure it&amp;#39;s  &amp;#39;daughter&amp;#39;s name&amp;#39; day, not mine.&amp;quot; and then she did her passive aggressive laugh and a few minutes later, left. I was about to cry at this point and just wanted her gone. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When she left, everyone came up to me and asked who that rude lady, bitch, jerk, etc. was and what was her problem? I stopped talking to mil for almost 2 months after the shower. She finally apologized (non apology) and I decided to just move on, and there have been some small issues since, but I&amp;#39;m starting to get a backbone with her. It&amp;#39;s just growing a little slower than I&amp;#39;d like.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Here’s a (not so) quick recap: \\n\\nHot Lips is my MIL.  She was always overbearing, and nosy, but she became extremely controlling, entitled, obsessive, and passive aggressive after I had my LO almost a year and a half ago.  \\n\\nI’ll provide a few examples of her behavior.  She destroyed our first week home with LO after he was born.  She barged in on me half naked twice when she heard my LO crying and she refuses to apologize for it.  She completely disregarded boundaries we set (no kissing, no social media, etc.), and then insisted those events never happened.  I was so stressed.  I spent most of my time pumping alone so she could be with LO (I had no spine).  \\n\\nShe selected and made LO’s first Halloween costume (a scarecrow) without asking us, and then became angry when DH said we had one selected.  She snoops through our stuff, but says she doesn’t and claims she isn’t nosy.  Though she vehemently denies it, she tries to parent LO (and us), and she calls LO her baby or her son.  She’s obsessed with LO’s development, and tries to compare LO to other babies.  She’s in a one-sided competition with my parents and said something very cruel to my mom.  \\n\\nWe haven’t seen Hot Lips or FIL since before the holidays (when they made their authority figure claims), and they haven’t received any photos of LO in over 6 months (since they told us we had enough pictures of LO and refused to share a video of LO with us).  We recently got the video.  I assume this is because she’s desperate for pictures of LO.  They acted like they just forgot to send it to us.\\n\\nI haven’t responded to any communication since they wished life would go back to the way it was before DH married me.  That’s when I told them they were no longer welcome to stay with us when they visit.  They canceled their holiday visit stating that they forgot to buy tickets, but there is no way they actually forgot.  My best guess is that they’re trying to punish us, and she wants us to beg them to come.  They skipped an annual visit this spring, and didn’t even mention it.  And, MIL sent DH an email informing him that they had no plans to visit us anytime soon!  (Great, thank you.) So, she’s basically punishing herself in an effort to punish us.  She has missed out on a lot of LO’s life all because we asked her to respect our privacy and our common sense boundaries (like no swearing in front of LO), and she doesn’t think she should have any boundaries, so she reacted bitterly, refusing to accept our boundaries, making so many passive aggressive comments that I’ve lost count, and refusing to apologize because she’s done nothing wrong.\\n\\nDH quit video chatting with them a few months ago when Hot Lips asked for parenting feedback she didn’t actually want in a thinly veiled attempt to get pictures of LO.  She got defensive and angry when he gave her feedback, and after a lot of ridiculous emails, she issued a completely fake apology.  \\n\\nShe has since sent me two non-apologies where she expressed regret that I took what they said the wrong way.  She also wrote that I’m important because I’m DH’s wife and LO’s mother (I’m not sure why that was relevant unless she was just looking to insult me).  I think she’s stepping up her efforts to rug sweep because she decided she doesn’t like her current consequences and she wants everything to go back to the way it was (that’s never, ever happening).\\n\\nDH has been texting with Hot Lips and FIL a few days a week, and calling them about twice a month.  They’ve asked to video chat with LO, but DH told them they’re just going to talk for now.  DH didn’t call this weekend, but he did call last weekend.  During these calls, they have not asked about me once.  It’s clear they blame me for this situation and I’m quite certain she wishes I’d just disappear.  It’s infuriating that I’ve overlooked so much of MIL’s behavior, and I’ve been thoughtful, kind, and respectful toward them, and somehow her inability to be a decent human being is my fault.\\n\\nHot Lips and FIL recently got some bad news that they shared with DH via text.  DH responded via text, but didn’t call.  Hot Lips sent the text below this morning.  \\n\\n“We missed talking with you yesterday and we miss seeing OP and LO!!  With all of our bad news recently, it makes us so sad that our relationship is still in the pits.  What can we do?  We love you so much!  Love, your very sad parents. 😢😢”\\n\\nHow would you respond to that?  She’s asked for feedback before.  If DH tells her we need them to respect our boundaries and our privacy, she says that she doesn’t understand why we keep hitting them over the head with our boundaries.  She often ignores questions DH asks, or she reacts terribly, with mean, passive aggressive, and bitter comments, paragraphs about her hurt feelings, and denials about events that happened.  DH wants to respond, and I think he needs to be more direct this time around.

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a (not so) quick recap: &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hot Lips is my MIL.  She was always overbearing, and nosy, but she became extremely controlling, entitled, obsessive, and passive aggressive after I had my LO almost a year and a half ago.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ll provide a few examples of her behavior.  She destroyed our first week home with LO after he was born.  She barged in on me half naked twice when she heard my LO crying and she refuses to apologize for it.  She completely disregarded boundaries we set (no kissing, no social media, etc.), and then insisted those events never happened.  I was so stressed.  I spent most of my time pumping alone so she could be with LO (I had no spine).  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She selected and made LO’s first Halloween costume (a scarecrow) without asking us, and then became angry when DH said we had one selected.  She snoops through our stuff, but says she doesn’t and claims she isn’t nosy.  Though she vehemently denies it, she tries to parent LO (and us), and she calls LO her baby or her son.  She’s obsessed with LO’s development, and tries to compare LO to other babies.  She’s in a one-sided competition with my parents and said something very cruel to my mom.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We haven’t seen Hot Lips or FIL since before the holidays (when they made their authority figure claims), and they haven’t received any photos of LO in over 6 months (since they told us we had enough pictures of LO and refused to share a video of LO with us).  We recently got the video.  I assume this is because she’s desperate for pictures of LO.  They acted like they just forgot to send it to us.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I haven’t responded to any communication since they wished life would go back to the way it was before DH married me.  That’s when I told them they were no longer welcome to stay with us when they visit.  They canceled their holiday visit stating that they forgot to buy tickets, but there is no way they actually forgot.  My best guess is that they’re trying to punish us, and she wants us to beg them to come.  They skipped an annual visit this spring, and didn’t even mention it.  And, MIL sent DH an email informing him that they had no plans to visit us anytime soon!  (Great, thank you.) So, she’s basically punishing herself in an effort to punish us.  She has missed out on a lot of LO’s life all because we asked her to respect our privacy and our common sense boundaries (like no swearing in front of LO), and she doesn’t think she should have any boundaries, so she reacted bitterly, refusing to accept our boundaries, making so many passive aggressive comments that I’ve lost count, and refusing to apologize because she’s done nothing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;DH quit video chatting with them a few months ago when Hot Lips asked for parenting feedback she didn’t actually want in a thinly veiled attempt to get pictures of LO.  She got defensive and angry when he gave her feedback, and after a lot of ridiculous emails, she issued a completely fake apology.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She has since sent me two non-apologies where she expressed regret that I took what they said the wrong way.  She also wrote that I’m important because I’m DH’s wife and LO’s mother (I’m not sure why that was relevant unless she was just looking to insult me).  I think she’s stepping up her efforts to rug sweep because she decided she doesn’t like her current consequences and she wants everything to go back to the way it was (that’s never, ever happening).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;DH has been texting with Hot Lips and FIL a few days a week, and calling them about twice a month.  They’ve asked to video chat with LO, but DH told them they’re just going to talk for now.  DH didn’t call this weekend, but he did call last weekend.  During these calls, they have not asked about me once.  It’s clear they blame me for this situation and I’m quite certain she wishes I’d just disappear.  It’s infuriating that I’ve overlooked so much of MIL’s behavior, and I’ve been thoughtful, kind, and respectful toward them, and somehow her inability to be a decent human being is my fault.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hot Lips and FIL recently got some bad news that they shared with DH via text.  DH responded via text, but didn’t call.  Hot Lips sent the text below this morning.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We missed talking with you yesterday and we miss seeing OP and LO!!  With all of our bad news recently, it makes us so sad that our relationship is still in the pits.  What can we do?  We love you so much!  Love, your very sad parents. 😢😢”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;How would you respond to that?  She’s asked for feedback before.  If DH tells her we need them to respect our boundaries and our privacy, she says that she doesn’t understand why we keep hitting them over the head with our boundaries.  She often ignores questions DH asks, or she reacts terribly, with mean, passive aggressive, and bitter comments, paragraphs about her hurt feelings, and denials about events that happened.  DH wants to respond, and I think he needs to be more direct this time around.  Things will never be the way they were before; they’ve destroyed my relationship with them as well as my opinion of them.  I don’t trust them and I don’t like them.  Only time will improve things, and if she keeps acting like she doesn’t know what happened, then I will never be able to move forward.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for letting me vent, and for your advice.  ❤️&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Isn\\'t it disturbing that some Mean Girls stay that way their entire lives, even at 60+?? It\\'s sad actually isn\\'t it? \\n\\nWe visited MIL and FIL, who dragged us to a dinner party hosted by their friends. MIL has a crew of biddies  (picture stepford housewives but 60+ years old and South Asian). They\\'re a tight-knit group who also gossip about each other constantly (as per FILs and SILs comments). MIL kept hinting to me that this is a \"dressy dinner\". You see, MIL and SIL are very fancy ladies who are always dressed up in sparkles and lots of florals and bright lipsticks and always have 10 layers of makeup on. No judgement, I believe we should all do what makes us feel good, but MIL was clearly worried about my debutante appearance in front of her homegirls. As a side, I think women are beautiful on a spectrum of styles and there is no one definition of femininity. I\\'m a young woman in tech, I love working out and hiking etc, so my style is more laidback and natural. Anyways, DH tells MIL that were not here to get fancy for a dinner party, were here to spend time with them. MIL insisted we must come to this dinner and we have to dress up. Sorry girlfriend, I don\\'t carry such clothes for a weekend family visit and frankly I\\'m not your doll. So I wore black skinny jeans and a nice blouse, did my hair and makeup. My MIL CBF\\'d hard at me, but keep on suckin your lemons lady, you\\'re lucky I\\'m even going to this shindig. \\n\\nHere\\'s the fun part of the story. DH and I drove separately and when we got there, MIL opened the door and rushed me to the garden where the biddies were all hanging out. Y\\'all. I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever been subjected to more Mean Girl attitude in my life. They each had a Sour Lemon look on their face, looked me up and down with what I would describe as disdain and made zero effort to be friendly or welcoming (I felt like I was in a movie, they were so dramatically rude). It became very clear very quickly that MIL has been talking mad shit about me to these ladies. I generally have thick skin and care very little what people I don\\'t know think of me but it was hella uncomfortable so I dipped out of there and found DH. After telling him I\\'m uncomfortable and this is stupid, we told MIL we\\'re leaving (glorious CBF ensues). \\n\\nNext day, I leave to meet a friend in that city for a few hours while DH stays with his parents. In this time, MIL started telling him a \"funny story\" about how one of the biddies is looking for a suitor for her daughter. In MILs culture, parents playing matchmaker is still a thing. MIL and FIL met in school by the way, with no parental interference and she prides herself on being a \"modern lady\". MIL starts telling DH all about the daughter, she\\'s very pretty, working on her masters, understands their culture and .... She told her mom she had a crush on DH. MIL laughs, DH laughs and says that\\'s weird but okay thinking that was it. It wasn\\'t ! The \"funny story\" turns into MIL telling DH that her and biddie were talking about how they wish they could match DH with the daughter and how perfect it would be. Don\\'t you think it would have been perfect DH ??? At this point, DH gets pissed and says I already have a perfect wife and this is weird and walks away. I get home a few hours later and have no idea about this when MIL starts chatting and also tells me the \"funny story\" but more in a \"isn\\'t it so funny this girl has a crush on DH\". We\\'re very secure with each other, so I really didn\\'t think anything of it other than my MIL being her weird self and humored her by saying something about DH being a catch. \\n\\nNow that I\\'m processing this, I realize, it\\'s kinda fucked up no?? Before we met, MIL and FIL tried for years to pressure DH into an arranged marriage because they were afraid he\\'d end up marrying outside their culture and that was MILs biggest nightmare (haha). DH ended up going NC for almost a year after they accused him of being a horrible son for not wanting to marry a stranger just to appease his parents. \\n\\nIts super insulting what MIL said though - hes a married man and she\\'s inviting him to chat about how perfect it would have been to be with someone else instead??? We have a business we\\'ve built from the ground up together, a home, a happy life, but none of it matters because he\\'s not with someone she approved of from her culture. Funny enough, DH and I got engaged after 6 months of dating after I hadn\\'t even met his parents yet since they\\'re far. He doesn\\'t care about her approval obviously. \\n\\nWe only see MIL twice a year for a couple of days and I\\'m already VLC and DH is LC so I\\'m not bothered. But thanks MIL for continuously validating my decision to not have a relationship with you :)\\n\\n\\nEdit : thanks so much for the love and the silver !! Love this safe community!',\n",

It&amp;#39;s sad actually isn&amp;#39;t it? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We visited MIL and FIL, who dragged us to a dinner party hosted by their friends. MIL has a crew of biddies  (picture stepford housewives but 60+ years old and South Asian). They&amp;#39;re a tight-knit group who also gossip about each other constantly (as per FILs and SILs comments). MIL kept hinting to me that this is a &amp;quot;dressy dinner&amp;quot;. You see, MIL and SIL are very fancy ladies who are always dressed up in sparkles and lots of florals and bright lipsticks and always have 10 layers of makeup on. No judgement, I believe we should all do what makes us feel good, but MIL was clearly worried about my debutante appearance in front of her homegirls. As a side, I think women are beautiful on a spectrum of styles and there is no one definition of femininity. I&amp;#39;m a young woman in tech, I love working out and hiking etc, so my style is more laidback and natural. Anyways, DH tells MIL that were not here to get fancy for a dinner party, were here to spend time with them. MIL insisted we must come to this dinner and we have to dress up.

She will never be pressured to do anything like that, not with anyone, not by anyone. In the end, we won and she is going with my recommendation and going with a group of her girl friends.

Now she is happy to hang out and be a pretty young lady with her friends.\\n \\nThis reminds me of FFF. \\n\\nIF you have read the past post you can tell what a lovely and attentive mother figure she was....just a peach...- ok so you know she was anything but.\\n\\nWhen it came time to my high school dances I at 16, was well fully grown. I used to play sports and do martial arts so I was in great shape.  Never once had my mother ever taken me shopping, gotten my hair and nails done..make up...nothing. (this is relevant)\\n\\nSo one day when I come home in between school and work she walks up all nice and says oh we need to go shopping and have a girls day...all sweet - it was worse then a horror movie I knew something was up.\\n\\nI asked why? You never want to do that plus I have work and a softball game later.  She tells me we have guest and wants me to look my best. \\n\\nRemember my fellow redditors, I said my stepasswhole was a different ethnicity ... mother fell into his brain washing /mind numbing bullshit. \\n\\nI tell her no thank I have to work and my team needs me (hello short stop and power hitter plus I was trying for a scholarship) \\n\\nI go towards the door and out walks the step jerk and I swear a flock..that\\'s what it looked like of the same ethnicity. (Which I have no problem with that\\'s why I am keeping this as vague as possible) \\n\\nI\\'m stuck as I cant get in the door but this Male in his 30\\'s walks around me like I\\'m some kind of....well like you were inspecting a show horse for sale. I don\\'t like it, I dont like him either he just give me the creeps. \\n\\nThen he looks me in the eyes, sees my Irish furry as he won\\'t let me get by and states.\\n\"So much spirit, it will be fun to break her\"\\n\\nIt clicks in my head...they were trying to marry me off...fuck this..I\\'m American, in America..and I\\'m irish.\\n\\nI spit right in his face and then punch him and knock him out. (Spitting is a severe form of disrespect) and I tell them in their language that my body is not for sale and Irish will never break...we destroy those who dare try to break us.\\n\\nI stepped over his body as he\\'s coming around grab my work stuff and game stuff and run to work. \\n\\nI swore that day no child of mine would ever be forced to do anything she/he  didn\\'t want especially dating.\\n\\nI heard the screaming for days...they had already received money..but they couldn\\'t force me..and since I had made such a show now their name was mud...no one would accept me...or my sisters...or even his own daughter I had ruined the family..\\n\\nI took the punishment, the attempted beatings and they realized they couldn\\'t hurt me anymore physically the did the one thing to make me run away which I will post later.\\n\\nSo I look at my SD smiling and think of what FFF tried to do...and how she will never ruin these moments for my family.',\n",

(Which I have no problem with that&amp;#39;s why I am keeping this as vague as possible) &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m stuck as I cant get in the door but this Male in his 30&amp;#39;s walks around me like I&amp;#39;m some kind of....well like you were inspecting a show horse for sale. I don&amp;#39;t like it, I dont like him either he just give me the creeps. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then he looks me in the eyes, sees my Irish furry as he won&amp;#39;t let me get by and states.\\n&amp;quot;So much spirit, it will be fun to break her&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It clicks in my head...they were trying to marry me off...fuck this..I&amp;#39;m American, in America..and I&amp;#39;m irish.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I spit right in his face and then punch him and knock him out. (Spitting is a severe form of disrespect) and I tell them in their language that my body is not for sale and Irish will never break...we destroy those who dare try to break us.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stepped over his body as he&amp;#39;s coming around grab my work stuff and game stuff and run to work. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I swore that day no child of mine would ever be forced to do anything she/he  didn&amp;#39;t want especially dating.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I heard the screaming for days...they had already received money..but they couldn&amp;#39;t force me..and since I had made such a show now their name was mud...no one would accept me...or my sisters...or even his own daughter I had ruined the family..&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I took the punishment, the attempted beatings and they realized they couldn&amp;#39;t hurt me anymore physically the did the one thing to make me run away which I will post later.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So I look at my SD smiling and think of what FFF tried to do...and how she will never ruin these moments for my family.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "\"Hello! You may have noticed more flairs around the sub lately. That's because we have listened to user feedback requesting ways to allow more open dialogue between OPs and commenters. To facilitate this, we have implemented a flair system that allows the OP to let our community know their situation and what level of feedback they are comfortable with. For our community, the OP can include a trigger warning with any of these. From now on, we will require all posts to have a flair. Any post that is not will either be taken down temporarily or have a flair assigned by a moderator. If your post is taken down, you will have to choose a flair and then contact the moderators via [ModMail](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/JUSTNOMIL) to have your post restored. To help you understand the flairs, I've included the descriptions of the flairs that you can find in the [JustNoMIL Wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/wiki/index)\\n\\nThe new language you will find in the Wiki is:\\n\\n&gt;An OP can select one of the following flairs to tag a post. You are allowed to tailor your comments to fit *within reason.* Rule 5 remains in effect. Posts that are left without flair are subject to being temporarily removed, or having flair chosen for them, at moderator discretion. There are also trigger warning versions of each flair. **Trigger Warning** flairs dictate that the trigger warning be briefly described in the **first** sentence of the post.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Old Story- NO Advice Wanted (*Rather self explanatory*)  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;It's Handled- NO Advice Wanted (*While not exactly historical, the OP has the situation in hand and doesn't need advice.*)  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;RANT- NO Advice Wanted (*Sometimes, you just need to get it out. What you don't need are pointers.*)  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;RANT- Advice Wanted (*Sometimes, you need to get it out and then ask if you've missed something.*)  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;TLC Needed (*For when you've had that hard day and you just need someone to give a damn.*)  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Advice Please! (*Pointers are welcome.*)  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;LIVE Advice Please! (*For developing situations that need advice in a hurry.*)  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Gentle Advice Needed (*For those times that you need advice but are feeling a little sensitive.*)  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Am I the JustNO? (*Worried that you're the one who is behaving badly? Let your fellow community members help you figure that out. MILpologizing allowed within reason.*)  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Am I Overreacting? (*Is she a JustNo or isn't she? MILpologizing allowed within reason.*)  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Give It To Me Straight (*For when you need advice with a kick. MILpologizing allowed within reason.*)  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;New User (*Be Gentle.*)  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Trigger Warnings should be used for Domestic/Interpersonal Violence, Child Abuse of any kind, Sexual Violence of any kind, Graphic descriptions of violent situations, Suicide, Hate Speech and the actions that go along with it, Pregnancy Loss and Loss of a Child.\""

       "      <td>Hello! You may have noticed more flairs around the sub lately. That's because we have listened to user feedback requesting ways to allow more open dialogue between OPs and commenters. To facilitate this, we have implemented a flair system that allows the OP to let our community know their situation and what level of feedback they are comfortable with. For our community, the OP can include a trigger warning with any of these. From now on, we will require all posts to have a flair. Any post that is not will either be taken down temporarily or have a flair assigned by a moderator. If your post is taken down, you will have to choose a flair and then contact the moderators via [ModMail](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/JUSTNOMIL) to have your post restored. To help you understand the flairs, I've included the descriptions of the flairs that you can find in the [JustNoMIL Wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/wiki/index)\\n\\nThe new language you will find in the Wiki is:\\n\\n&amp;gt;An OP can select one of the following flairs to tag a post. You are allowed to tailor your comments to fit *within reason.* Rule 5 remains in effect. Posts that are left without flair are subject to being temporarily removed, or having flair chosen for them, at moderator discretion. There are also trigger warning versions of each flair. **Trigger Warning** flairs dictate that the trigger warning be briefly described in the **first** sentence of the post.  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;Old Story- NO Advice Wanted (*Rather self explanatory*)  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;It's Handled- NO Advice Wanted (*While not exactly historical, the OP has the situation in hand and doesn't need advice.*)  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;RANT- NO Advice Wanted (*Sometimes, you just need to get it out.

       "      <td>This is a story from when I was growing a spine. It's an older one, but I'll share it here for anyone who is shining up their own spine. A motivational missive maybe? I hope you enjoy.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI had a baby. Like you do. It doesn't feel like it was terribly long ago but my kid is over ten so things have definitely changed since then. Back in those days, we didn't have fancy video baby monitors or breathing sensors or any of the amazing fancy things you new moms get these days. We had a simple baby monitor. The base was in the baby's room and the receiver was either in our bedroom or the living room, wherever we were. It was a pretty good monitor, you could definitely hear what was going on in the baby's room... and so our story begins.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy parents were visiting. I didn't know what a JustNo was at that time- I knew my biological father was abusive, hence the restraining orders. But my mom was so much better than him, I didn't ever think to question what she said... until I became a mother. Then all bets were off. I lost my first baby and NOBODY was going to do anything wrong when my son was born. His health and safety came first. Anyway, my JSometimesMom and VeryJustYesSaintofAStepfather were visiting.  My mother had some opinions about our parenting decisions (things had changed since the 70's?!?!? Who would have thought?) but kept them mostly to herself. Until my aunt called her. We were all in the living room and so she took her cell into the baby's room to sit in the rocker and chat. And trash my parenting.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnd so we sat in the living room, my husband and I, (I don't remember where my JYSF was) and heard her make fun of me and my choice of... everything. And how I was overprotective and this and that. It lasted a good 20 minutes. Then she came back, completely oblivious to the fact that we'd heard the whole thing. A lifetime of rugsweeping training kicked in and I pretended nothing had happened. More time passed in the visit, she played with the baby, I fed him, my stepfather came back from probably Home Depot. And we were all in the living room when the baby had a blowout.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nDH and I took the baby to his room to change the baby and get the blowout damage under control. And while we were in there, we were very aware that anything we said would be heard over the baby monitor in the living room. Both of my parents would hear anything we said. I can't remember the specifics of what we said, but I know it was in reference to some \"suggestions\" my mother had made that were out of date or wouldn't work for us. We weren't mean or rude- just matter of fact about how it wouldn't work. When the baby was cleaned up, we went back to the living room and were greeted with the biggest, cat-caught-the-canary, smirk on my mother's face. We sat down and she said, \"You should be careful what you say in the room with the baby monitor.\"  \\n\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnd y'all. That new mom spine showed up. \"Yes,\" I said. \"We learned that when you were on the phone with Aunt.\"  \\n\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe smirk froze and then in an instant turned to horror.  Horror because her daughter dared talk back to her. Horror because she had been robbed of the gloating that she was so certain she was about to enjoy. But mainly horror because she had been sitting there stewing. And in her mind, she had worked herself up into believing that being overheard on the baby monitor was SHAMEFUL. And anyone who was overheard saying anything unflattering on the monitor deserved to be embarrassed and ashamed. So with that designated as the proper response in her mind, now that she had been caught out for that very thing, she had to be embarrassed and ashamed. And it was awesome. My JYSF chuckled and they left shortly after.   \\n\\n\\nThe end.</td>\n",

       "      <td>My DH and I recently got married about 2 months ago, it’s been a dream as fair as our personal life, and we’re expecting a little bean in a few months.\\n\\nBut my MIL refuses to acknowledge that we’re married, refuses to acknowledge I exist, refuses to acknowledge my pregnancy, basically just acts like I don’t exist. \\n\\nShe recently tried to set him up with the niece of one of her friends. The poor girl shows up to MILs house with her aunt thinking it’s just a simple visit and is met with my MIL bombarding her trying to introduce them, then gestured to me, holding hands with my husband, visibly pregnant and goes “Don’t worry about her, she’s just his little slut.”\\n\\nIt made me feel like the old MTV show parental control. \\n\\nThankfully the innocent girl politely declined and told her aunt she’d wait in the car for her, and my D(ear)H packed up our things and left, telling his mother she can call him when she comes to her senses, or not at all. \\n\\n\\nFamily is very important to me but I have no clue how to handle this.\\n\\n\\nETA: my husband has never had a good relationship with his mother. I wanted to maybe try to fix that which is why up until now I’ve been maybe a little bit of a doormat. She’s never called me a name to my or my DHs face, and if she had I wouldn’t have taken that abuse, especially pregnant. But I am maybe a little weak and not as ferocious as I once was, because this baby has taken all my anger and replaced it with just crying. That’s my response is crying. I think he’s gonna be a little spitfire. \\n\\n\\nAnyway, I know that I need to just cut her off entirely and that’s what I plan to do. Thank you all for your kind, a little stern words. I hope I won’t have to post in this subreddit again, but I have a feeling I may.</td>\n",

I sort of would like to hear everyone's opinion on if I was over reacting?\\n\\n\\nSo this afternoon mother in law invited our family over for a BBQ. We haven't seen DH little sister for a while so DH wanted to go. So I figure I can fake liking MIL for a night. \\n\\nWell his sister(17) asked me if I wanted to walk across the street with her to the store to buy a few things. And I ask DH if he would keep an eye on DS( and he said he would. \\n\\n\\nWhen we got back from the store I walk into the house and see DS sitting next to the power outlet pulling on cords that were plugged in and chewing on them. Now he's the part we're I mention he was soaking wet. MIL poured ice chips on the floor for him to play with because she doesn't have AC and it's around 100°. \\n\\nNow i asked nicely (because MIL was right next to him and I'm on the other side of the house ) if she would grab him. Well she looked at him said he's fine he's not in any danger. Well I got PISSEd that she wasnt taking it seriously so I ran to him and I picked him up. And I packed up all of our stuff and we left all without me saying a single word to MIL. \\n\\n\\nMoments later MIL shows up at our house (a 45 minute drive away) to demand I apologize and how I disrespected her in her own house and that I was very rude because she invited us over and bought all the food for dinner. (Which we didn't eat). She always claims that he outlets are surge protector safe. Which means DS wouldn't be able to electricute himself.

My mother in law and I were friends before she was my mother in law. She introduced me to my husband. This past weekend though, she nearly killed my son.\\n\\nWe let our son go on his first trip with my mother in law last weekend. She took him 6 hours away. As we put the car seat in the car we went over his medicine schedule since my son has asthma. We went over how important it is for him to get his maintenance medicine because, you know, asthma. Along the trip I got tons of pictures of him having fun. Everything seemed so great.\\n\\nMonday comes around and he gets home late in the evening and he has dark circles around his eyes and a cough. My mother in law leaves quickly because she still has to drop off my nephews 2 hours away.  I start unpacking my son’s bag and lo and behold there sits his medicine packs, completely untouched. I texted my mother in law and she says “ I didn’t think he really needed it, he wasn’t coughing much.” Ok first off you weren’t part of us making him therefore you DO NOT get to make medical decisions for him. Second, THIS IS WHY WE DON’T LET YOU SEE HIM UNSUPERVISED!!!\\n\\nSo we started trying to play catch up and get his asthma under control.  Spoiler, it didn’t work. Thursday we wound up in the emergency room and were sent home. Friday was his birthday and he spent it mostly asleep saying he can’t breathe. Sunday we wound up back at the hospital and were admitted. I told him to tell his mother what she’d caused and [this bitch takes zero responsibility.](https://imgur.com/a/9wbgASF) So now my poor baby has an IV (he wound up dehydrated also) and has to go through breathing treatments ever 4 hours because she “didn’t think he needed it”.  \\n\\n\\nWe’ve finally gotten his oxygen saturation up to the mid 90s (it was in the 80s) and should get discharged tonight.</td>\n",

My MIL called DH and asked why wasn't she told sooner, and he told her it was because he didnt want to yet. She was angered by the response, told my first child hello, and then hung up. She knew I was in the room (was stated earlier), and did not acknowledge it at all. 3 days passed, and she hasn't called, texted, mentioned me, the pregnancy, or anything of the matter.

She's getting congratulated left and right on social media, but has yet to congratulate her own son, so I feel like the post was just for attention.\\n3. The REAL reason she didn't know sooner, is because she made my first pregnancy a living hell. She constantly made comments about me not eating enough (not true), she would act shocked when I ate around her, she kept tabs on my prenatal appointment times, and called literal minutes after every single appointment to ask how much I weigh, and shamed me the one appointment I didn't gain weight... I had a melt down in the OB office because of it. My DH telling her \"because I didnt want to\", when she asked why wasn't she told sooner was putting it nicely. \\n \\nI don't want to speak to her.

       "      <td>To preface, this will be a long one, I'll try to condense as much as possible. \\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nPrevious to our son being born, my SO and I moved in with his mother at her insistence to start saving for a home. We agreed with a 1-year max goal of purchasing a space of our own. She lives in a very large 6 bedroom house by herself and seemed quite excited to have us join her. We currently occupy the 3 bedroom portion of her basement where we mostly keep to ourselves and leave her to her own routine as often as possible. In exchange for our space, we pay a small amount in rent to help with the electric, etc. bills and I have taken over most of the house and yard duties (I'm a SAHM and really don't mind, it keeps me busy). As of a few months ago, my SO and she started disagreeing. Everything from his job, his health, his parenting, his schedule, anything, really. I did my best to stay out of it, mostly because they were being quite petty with one another and I didn't feel the need to interject and cause further drama but in my opinion, she was berating him constantly. Then the small oddities started occurring. Little rules such as no drinking in her home (she never had a problem beforehand and we drink maybe once a month, if at all), not using the dish drying rack (she \\*never\\* does dishes by the way, I take care of them), not parking where we have agreed to park from day 1, only using very, very specific spots in the fridge and pantry (she also doesn't eat at home that often and has maybe a carton of milk and a few yogurts in the fridge, everything else is preperation items and leftovers from family meals that I make for everyone, including her) . All very weird, petty things that aren't even worth diving deeper into. SO and MIL by this point have had a few extremely heated berating arguments and we were finally told to move out immediately. She \"can't live like this.\" We accepted that we were going to have to use a chunk of our savings for a rental and found something that very weekend. When we informed her of our plans, she apologized and felt horrible that we would be using our funds for a rental instead of towards a home. We all agreed that we should stay. Not even a week later, SO and MIL engage in another heated argument and she threatens to call child protective services because he is abusive (for the record, he isn't abusive IN THE LEAST, not to me, not to our children, he's just fed up with her constant put-downs). This is when I finally started getting involved. When it comes to my children, I will not have someone threatening to have them removed from my custody. In hindsight, I realized later she would have no grounds for such a thing and it would be impossible to actually follow through with, but I digress. Things calmed down once again but only for a moment. While making breakfast for the family, MIL included (this is just days ago), she arrives in the kitchen to start talking down to my SO yet again. He loses it, she leaves the home out of anger, and we are left with PAGES of texts of our abusive behavior towards her and we need to be out of her house immediately (again). For the very first time in the 6 months we have lived there, I stand up for my family. I respond back to her texts with my own choice words of HER abusive behavior towards us. We get home to multiple eviction notices scattered around the home which I promptly gathered and tossed in her room while yelling at her to just leave us alone along with other choice words because by this point, I was incredibly fed up with her and her drama, especially after attempting to forgive her for the Child Protective Services threat. In front of me, she then calls the police and tells them I am threatening violence and trespassing. We gather the children and leave the house immediately. I spoke to the police officer on scene through a phone call and explain what actually happened and that we are rent-paying tenants of her home and will be returning. He agrees that we are allowed to and we go home. It's been a horror show ever since we arrived. We do not have the time, energy, or funds to move out with such immediacy (my god, we need \\*at least\\* a week to find a rental, not an afternoon). Constant eviction noticed plastered around the home, stomping about whenever we are in the kitchen, blocking my car so I cannot leave, insert a million other passive aggressive actions here. Not to mention, I am no longer allowing her near my children or myself. It's very clear she's mentally unstable and understandably, I don't feel safe around her. \\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nPhew, that was a mouthful. If you made it this far, bless you, you're a Rockstar Reader. We have no idea how to navigate our living situation while we rental hunt. This person we are living with is a monster. She is abusive, she is aggressive, and now she is making things up to actual police officers in an attempt to have me arrested. I am worried she will succeed, I am worried she will go after my children (I am sending the oldest to stay with my parents in another state until we find a new home, I don't want him near the drama), and I am worried she will damage or alter our things while we are not home. I have gone in and out of crying out of actual shock that a person could do this to someone else they previously (at least, seemingly) cared about. How do we do this?</td>\n",

       "      <td>So I’m back already. \\n\\nThank you to everyone who commented yesterday. It was very validating to hear that DH and I weren’t in the wrong for hosting separate celebrations for our families. \\n\\nI thought based on what happened yesterday we’d get at the very minimum a single months reprieve from MIL. Instead DH comes home from work today bearing “good” news. \\n\\nMil has apologized for lashing out at him yesterday stating she “has to come to terms” with how “it’s going to be from now on.”  \\n\\nBasically to sum up her text (I don’t have DH’s phone and I don’t want to ask for it) she’s sorry to DH, and needs time to adjust to me not wanting her around people of my religion. THIS IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL! She’s completely missed the point of us separating our parties! And not only that, but no where was there an apology for saying the things she did about myself nor my family! \\n\\nDH says he’s still upset with her but I don’t feel like he’s upset for the reasons he should be. I tried talking to him about it today but it just ended with him being defensive and saying that we aren’t hosting separate events from now on. Everyone is just either going to have to deal with it or not come because he’s not dealing with something like this again. I won’t get more into this because I know this is a DH problem at this point and that’s not what this particular sub is about. \\n\\nI’m very upset and feel like this was a nonapology from MIL. She’s more than likely going to expect things to go back to the way they were after a little bit of time has passed. I don’t think I can do that. She’s hurt our relationship very deeply at this point and I want nothing to do with her for the foreseeable future. Nor do I really want my son to have anything other than a superficial relationship with this woman. I know I can’t keep DS away from her realistically to DH she’s still his mom and he very much wants her in our sons and his life. \\n\\nNot looking forward to the next few months at all. I feel like I have a cloud hanging over me.\\n\\n\\nEdit: So I have slept on this and now I’m just PISSED. I’m mad that she thinks she can pull this crap with DH. I’m mad she threatened him with their relationship over something like this. I’m mad about her comments about me. I’m mad she hasn’t even hinted at an apology to me for the things she said. She will not be welcome in our home for some time. I deserve just as much as my husband to be comfortable in my home and she does not fit into that picture right now. She will also not be seeing myself nor my son for some time. Until she acknowledges what she said and has said behind my back was hurtful and can sincerely apologize.</td>\n",

       "      <td>So I posted recently about my MIL who was put off by my \"bad energy\" and said she wasnt going to come over to our new house for a very long time. Well that didnt last, shortly after we had a housewarming with my family and invited his as well and she showed up! Kept to herself basically the entire time and didn't engage in any socializing but everyone else had a great time and me and SO  just took it as closing the door on that situation.\\n\\nFast forward to this past weekend, my baby shower. My mom and aunt very graciously planned the whole thing out and it was lovely! The only thorn in my side was that MIL decided not to come. After the housewarming I was feeling good about things moving forward, she had helped us purchase the crib and things seemed to be looking up. Keep in mind that she has known the date, location, etc of the baby shower for months at this point. My mom had made an attempt to involve her in the planning and she told my mom \"no it's okay do what you want\".\\n\\nMe and SO head out towards the shower when he receives a phone call through the Bluetooth system in his car from MIL. Her first question is if we are in the car together, he says yes and they begin speaking in Spanish. Now I wouldn't consider myself exactly fluent but I think they highly underestimate just how much I actually understand. I hear her saying how she doesnt think she's coming. She doesnt know anyone, she has no gifts to bring it'll make her look bad, its too far (my mom lives about 45 minutes away), she'll be the odd one out, amongst other things that I didnt quite catch. He keeps saying \"please come, for me\" she repeatedly says no, they continue this back and forth until she eventually says okay fine. \\n\\nHis summary to me of this conversation was basically \"oh she just feels bad because she doesnt have gifts to bring since shes already given them to us, but she's about to leave\". So now I know that MIL doesn't really want to be there but am satisfied that shes atleast still willing to suck it up and come. We arrive and not 5 minutes later SO gets a text and says \"my mom cant come, she says its raining too hard to drive.\" He accepts this excuse fully however I'm confused as to why she would be attempting to leave at the time the shower began and not the 40 minutes earlier she said she was? Me and SO live not 10 minutes from her so we know the weather wasn't bad til later. \\n\\nI brush it off for the moment and enjoy the event. Later on when we head home I mention to him that I did feel hurt that she didn't show up as this is her first grand child and it was important to us. He tries to make excuses for her and confessed that she didnt feel comfortable coming. This struck a cord remembering back to her extreme lack of understanding of my anxiety (see my last post) and the fact that I've pushed through being uncomfortable for her benefit many times already and had even been considering letting her be in the room for the birth despite having no real desire for her to be there, for my SO and her since it is her first grandchild.\\n\\nAfter this I don't think I want to have her in the room. Her actions are beginning to concern me more for our future relationship and her relationship with my child. Would it be wrong of me to only have my mom and SO in the room? Am I over reacting to this situation?</td>\n",

Sobbing, threatening to move far far away, more crying and is now getting FIL to relay her messages because she's just so upset. Unfortunately, the guilt tripping and hearing about her tears seems to be having an effect on SO. For the life of me I can't understand why, it's her same old song and dance that we've been through many times. \\n\\nThey have accused me of some bizarre and impossible things considering our LO isn't even born yet. Obviously I'm going to deny them access to the baby at all costs. I'm going to be overbearing and strict about 'silly things like feeding and naps with the baby'. I won't let her have a phone when she's older. I'm going to be worse than nephew's mom. Blahblahblah.

I've placed SO in the middle of this, they're now my family so I can't act this way, then it was finished off with some strange lovebombing and guilt tripping about how SO's grandma isn't feeling well. \\n\\nWorst part is that SO is definitely back in the FOG. He doesn't want to talk too much about all this shit because it 'stresses him out and they ARE his parents' but he did want to ask me if I'm okay with them babysitting once my maternity leave is up. What in the actual fuck. Obviously my response was fuck no, over my dead fucking body. We've talked in the past about no unsupervised visits.

At least it does for those who are not me, namely the aunt in this story and the Red Rocket.\\n\\nThe same week I went no contact with Red Rocket, actually just a day or two before, I got a text from her sister. It isn’t unheard of for me to get a direct message from the sisters (there are two, they function as a set). But this was different.\\n\\nFor context the first message was accompanied by a picture of my post on a local neighborhood group (that bitch isn’t even supposed to be in because she lives in another state and it is a closed FB group). All I said in the post was that I needed cheap Christmas lights because I was planning to use my MiL’s extra but she had sold them. Also we are atheist and raise our children secularly but Red Rocket has nagged me to decorate our house for Christmas so she can see lights from inside her house. She said it wasn’t fair we could see her lights and she didn’t get the same. I love lights and was all for it.\\n\\nSo, for your reading enjoyment, I give you the time I tried to mitigate the shit Red Rocket says behind my back with the nicer of DH’s two aunts:\\n\\n**Aunt**: Did you see this  give me give me give me I'm like Red Rocket starting to hate her what a brat snot and anything else Why is it we want every thing given to us I'm sorry but that is how I feel and I thought you didn't believe in Santa and the lights and decorations go with Christmas I'm totally confused by you no wonder it is hard\\n\\n**Me**: What? Red Rocket has offered us her extra lights because she wanted us to put lights on our house. She forgot and sold them. I still want to surprise dS1 (and Red Rocket, but I can't put that in a public post that I know she will see) and I want to do it for as cheap as possible. I have bought two sets for $2 from this post so far and found a thrift shop that has them for cheaper than the store.\\n\\nThat's all the post is about. What does your message mean?\\n\\nThis is AUNT, right?\\n\\n**Aunt**: Yes and I don't appreciate you putting she forgot it is only for drama just post you are in need of extra things that is like Taking a jab at her I have to feel for Red Rocket as that would just upset her more She is already torn about leaving adding to her anxiety won't help\\n\\n**Me**: I only put that as an explanation for why I want just running off to buy new at the store. \\n\\nI don't appreciate you assuming that I am jabbing anything at Red Rocket. I am not at all angry with her and I am really heartbroken over her leaving. Before she blew up at me and called me an unfit mother and tried to interfere in my marriage (all that happened out of the blue in two days) I felt like she was a mom to me. We understand that she is homesick and just want her to be happy.\\n\\nI am trying to be as supportive of her decisions as possible and help her get wherever she wants to go whenever she wants, including moving. Every time we are together she talks excitedly about what she imagines her life will be like back in Shittsville and it makes me incredibly sad that she is leaving, but I do not want to punish her for it or have anger in any way. \\n\\nI suspect she is telling you a different version of what life was like here for her to make it easier to come home. \\n\\n**Aunt**:  Not really she is homesick she was too isolated in a big city\\n\\n**Me**: She is telling us that I am too controlling and she doesn't know why DH ever married me. She accused us of allowing the dog to sexually assault DS. She accused me of elder abuse for cursing. She's picking fights to push us away so it is easier for her to move.\\n\\nWe aren't taking the bait anymore (not since the dog incident, since it was so out there we thought it was a joke at first) and are continuing to live peacefully. I know her anxiety is high so we are trying to take her lead on contact so we don't stress her out. \\n\\nI hope you don't believe all that she says about us. The things she says when she is mad indicate that she is saying things about us that may not be accurate when she isn't mad. After your visit she started talking about how her BUSINESS stuff was us taking advantage of her but she always decided where the money went and if we were going to look for STOCK. We didn't take money from it, she decided what it would be spent on. But her feelings towards it seemed to change and we tried to go along with that too. We've tried to accommodate all the projects she has shown interest in.\\n\\nAnyway, frankly, I intend to make sure that I honor my promise to take care of her while she is here and make sure that I support her in her transition. \\n\\nI have pushed fairly hard for her to treat her anxiety because it is driving a lot of her daily life, even in retirement. I hope she finds a path to happiness.\\n\\n**Aunt**:  (no response)\\n\\nOh my god I just re-read the first thing you sent and I realized if I add punctuation it makes sense. And that you didn't mean to send it to me and you are saying you hate me. \\n\\nUm, yeah. Okay. I guess I really do know what Red Rocket says behind our backs.\\n\\n**Aunt**: No I'm saying I'm like her and basically everyone else that I'm am starting to hate everyone and their little comments I was so upset I type faster than I think and I do read things out of text sometime but I'm am still upset with this give me world and no one wants to work and earn their own way\\n\\n**Me**: So you think I am lazy because I made a post asking about Christmas lights? I paid for the damn things. Or is it because I stay home with my kids? \\n\\nIf I worked my kids couldn't go to their IMPORTANT MEDICAL STUFF. \\n\\nI don't want things given to me. I'd love to work. But my work is here making sure my kids have the best step forward in life they can possibly have. If me trying to find a deal on Facebook is so offensive to you that you feel you need to say you hate me, then maybe you should apologize. \\n\\nNo modifiers. Just an apology would be nice.\\n.......\\n\\nNo apology ever arrived. Shocker, I know. \\n\\nSo now for the pettiest or revenges. I continued to gather lights and then hit Walmart to buy strands that specifically did not match what I had already gathered. We did the worst decorating job we could. Strings hung mismatched and limply off the the windows and porch. I pooled a long red strand under the porch to make it look like someone bled out there in glowing lights. But we took all the lights that matched and put them neatly on the inside of the fence so we could see them looking nice, but she couldn’t. She could only see the front of our house and it looked like we tortured elves for fun and led a coup against Santa. \\n\\nWe left the lights up far too long. Red Rocket left 2/20 and we had them up until 3/1. I wanted to take them down 2/21 but it was snowing for a week. I also left them on all the time, no timer. \\n\\nNext year our lights will be amazing.</td>\n",

Veggie Devil (VD - MIL), has sent lies and gossiped and complained about myself and my mother from the get go but I was great when I was pregnant in her eyes, I am/was just an incubator to her. FIL is a prick too but that's for another sub.\\n\\nThe latest is we tried to go no contact obviously that didn't work for them after seeing DD at church from afar. They agreed to talk about things but then FIL blew it all up called it off. Well at a church gathering Veggie Devil had a flying monkey of of father (GFIL) come to DH and say that he needed to talk to his mother and that he doesn't need to tell (me) if he talks to her, and so on. This pissed me off greatly. Veggie Devil is a crafty bitch. \\n\\nMy mother, who is my carer, went to talk to GFIL and tell him please stay out of it and that I am really hurt by him saying what he said and that I wouldn't be bringing DD around. Well their son who we will call Uncle Asshole came into their house while my mum was there and screamed abuse at her saying he knew everything and that she and I were evil and brainwashed and manipulated DH into doing our bidding and that she is a hypocrite and an unchristian etc .. the only way he could 'know' is if VD has been gossiping and spreading lies about us. GMIL ushered him out and mum finished what she went there to do and tried explaining their daughter is a liar. My mum came home crying and talking to a minister of our church filling them in. I have never seen her this distressed and angry. \\n\\nThen at 11:30pm someone threw a rock at our front window where bub was sleeping luckily the window didn't break and the metal awning stopped it and the rock broke. We believe its GC SIL2 this is right up her valley. All of this is because of my bitch of a MIL. And her lies.\\n\\nWhen DHs birthday rolled around a couple of weeks ago she sent a long gaggy text \"22 years you came into my life and I was so happy because God brought a son to me!...etc\" \\n\\nI know this doesn't make any sense, any questions please ask, I'm just so confused and don't know what to do. All of this is MILs fault she sent the pumpkin, she tried to poison me, she never apologized, she lies saying we deny her a normal grandma relationship saying she can't see or touch DD whenever she wants, she has never offered to help, she only sees her wants. Selfish bitch.\\n\\nEdit: I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Posted this in different sub and was directed here, so a rather long and long-accumulated rant ahead, I apologise. \\n\\nMothers day- MIL already kicked up a fuss, first by insisting it was a week earlier than it really was. Fine, DH took her to dinner then and we thought we were done. Come the actual week, she STILL kept on at DH with \"what are you doing for MEEEE on mothers day?\" Geez woman, he took you to dinner the week before when you insisted it was mothers day. DH wanted to spend the day with just our own family, because it's my first mothers day and tells her as much. \"sorry, but Sunday itself we have our own plans, I'll see you for dinner on Monday.\" Reasonable, right? NOPE. She goes on a tirade about how he's UNGRATEFUL and Monday is NO LONGER MOTHERS DAY and my favourite: \"tell your wife to STOP HER NONSENSE\". (Yes, because whenever DH says no to you, it HAS to be MY fault.) DH, bless him, stood his ground (despite me telling him to just give in to her because I was so tired of the drama) and we spent Sunday on our own and he saw her on Monday (albeit with me in a huge ball of anxiety the whole weekend afraid of what she might pull). \\n\\nMeanwhile, I guess she isn't happy with the fact that DH regularly has dinner with her once every two weeks (he has a demanding job and we have a 6 month old, we Don't have the time or energy for any more of her), because she randomly and regularly blows up his phone with texts along the following lines of : \"be firm with your wife, don't let her control you, don't let her yell at you\" etc, and these come COMPLETELY out of the blue with Zero prior context or link. There's also been  \"If you need to travel for work, Go, your wife should not hold you back, tell her off, you can't be stuck earning X amount forever, and anyway, she has a nanny. I know you can do better.\" \\n\\n SO MUCH there that is absolutely out of line.\\n\\n1. Travel? BOTH DH and I agreed when we got engaged, that neither of us would travel for work. That wasn't the kind of married/family life we wanted, so I quit an extremely good job too because it involved yearly travel. And his job has never involved travel anyway. But all that aside, it's Our decision and Nothing to do with You, so why are you telling him this?\\n2. Absolutely, cloak your insanity in pretending to be concerned about his finances. Meanwhile, this woman earns More than Both my parents combined, and is STILL taking money from DH every month. This knowing that we're now tight with a new baby and its related expenses. \\n3. \"Anyway she has a nanny\"- Wow. So does having a nanny mean he gets to slack off parenting? I have a nanny because I have a full time job. (Unlike her, she did not, And had a nanny, but hey, that's a different story altogether.) And even with a nanny, I do not believe in completely outsourcing the raising of my child, so I bring Both baby and nanny with me to work where I can still be there to keep an eye on things and see my daughter all day. And once we get home, I take over baby because again, it's MY kid. So I still parent much of the day And work And make sure DH's needs are met- dinner is always on the table for him when he gets home for instance. My God, Why do I even feel the need to have to defend myself against such toxicity?\\n4. I am going to assume by \"you can do better\", she was purely referring to his job and earning potential. But somehow, I also do know that she definitely believes he could have 'done better' in other ways too, if you get what I mean.\\n5. The whole strain of general disrespect for his wife. Amazing. And yet, you think I should respect You?\\n\\nWell, now Fathers Day is coming up and you'd think we'd be safe (she and FIL are divorced and FIL lives continents away). But NO, DH gets a text of \"Sunday is Fathers Day. I'm doing lunch. Bring the baby to my house at x time\".\\n\\nExcuse me? Not even \"would you like to come over\"? And who the hell are you to dictate when and where I should bring my baby? And more importantly, WHAT DOES FATHERS DAY EVEN HAVE TO DO WITH YOU?\\n\\nDH tells her No, we have our own plans on the weekend and he'll see her for dinner on Monday as is when they usually meet. AGAIN she throws a HUGE tantrum, sending him unending guilt trip texts when he's AT WORK, Refusing to back down and insisting she wants to SEE THE BABY and that she hasn't seen baby in a long time.\\n\\nRight. Woman, You haven't seen baby in a long time because You got mad at me for setting a perfectly valid boundary (she wanted DH to do her work for her. Literally, what She is PAID to do. DH was busy, she wouldn't take no from him, so I texted her to tell her no) and ceased all contact with me, much less arrange visits with baby. Also, you've been texting him long strings of text about how he should 'keep his wife in check' and 'not let her control you' etc etc among other things, showing blatant disrespect for me, so why would I WANT you around me much less my child?\\n\\nFinally though, she successfully guilt trips DH into agreeing to a visit this Saturday.\\n\\nDH and I discuss it and set a time for her to come over in the afternoon with limits because we already have plans to work around.\\n\\nCue the following exchange:\\n\\nDH: come over at x time on Saturday then, but we have another appointment at xx time so don't be late (she is HORRIBLE at keeping to set times)\\n\\nMIL: Where are we having lunch?\\n\\nDH: we're not, just come over\\n\\nMIL: but I need to eat. Why are you being this way, and you call yourself a Christian (seriously woman? \"I need to eat\"?? Are you incapable of feeding yourself? Grab a bite before you come over?) \\n\\nDH: lunch period is usually when LO has a nap, so we won't be going out then. You said you want to see LO so come over at that time when she will be awake\\n\\nMIL: I don't need to see LO, just (only) you \\[ie, only DH\\] will meet me at x place to eat.\\n\\nALL. OF. MY. OH. MY. GODS.\\n\\nSo tired of arguing with crazy that we gave in and DH will meet her for lunch. Way to take your son away from his family on our very precious weekends. AND his first fathers day weekend at that.\\n\\nAnd you Insist on wanting to see LO, we literally ask you to come over, and then you do another 180? My mind.. is just blown.</td>\n",

Yesterday evening my fiance and I were planning on meeting up at my synagogue for a holiday event in which everyone got a free treat from an ice cream truck. Just show up, go to the truck, get anything off the menu free. Very innocent if you're a normal human. \\n\\nWell, before he left MIL, who is hyper-catholic, asked him where he was going. He told her about the event and she lost it. She went off for a while and basically told him that going to my temple is a slippery slope and that he's going to hell. In what I can only picture as the most flamboyant outrage MiL uttered the sentence \"You're risking your Immortal Soul for ice cream!\" \\n\\nMy fiance has been taking it in stride, though I can tell he's kinda upset by it too.

       "      <td>So, long time reader - first time poster. Long post. TL/DR; JNMIL is upset we aren't sending our DS to stay a couple weeks with her over the summer. I'm thinking of giving in and letting him go.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI have a reformed JNM who is now 100% JY(!) and my former JYMIL is now an aggravatingly JNMIL.  Make sense?\\n\\nThe important backstory is that when I met D(ear)H 8 years ago, my relationship with my mom was toxic. MIL at the time I met her seemed so JY! I was young and so sweetly naive. Ah, the lack of boundaries I had.... Well fast forward 5 years and my mom goes through some intensive therapy and consciously works on her own shit. It has been amazing. Like, I could actually tell her that I didn't emotionally trust her. She apologized - so many times over the years I've told her we're absolutely good now. \\*\\*Go to therapy! It 's the dopest of dope.\\n\\nJYMIL takes this same amount of time and basically degrades into a DARVO manipulative succubus.\\n\\nAn important piece of family info here: DH had a 2yo son when I met him. We got married when DS was 3yo. JNMIL up to that point had been the only \"rationally stable\" person in DH life - albeit she lives across the country. DS is the first and only bio grandchild she'd had (up until we had a baby this year. woop.). Of course DH is also the GC....\\n\\nConflict started brewing when we would go visit JNMIL on her horse ranch. If I would discipline DS (a toddler misbehaving? never.) She would take him out of time out behind my back and apologize to him for ME. I am DS full time mom and have an awesome bond with the kiddo. He's always been my number one and my motivation. The disrespect was shocking but I let it go as I was still newer to her family. I keep on over the years driving with DH to see her for our summer vacations. Things just subtly downgraded every time with her. She started piling on the emotional baggage. She needed you to know how much of a victim she'd been her entire career and life in general. It wasn't enough that she bled out on us adult children though, she started doing it to my DS.\\n\\nSee, that's a problem for me. I cannot stand adults who use children for emotional support. Especially kiddos who've been neglected and abandoned by their parent. Which DS had been by his bio mom when he turned 5yo. She just up and moved across the country with his half sister. She didn't call for a year. He went through a really rough time and I was the person he had to fall on as the SAHM.... I digress\\n\\nSo time goes on and I bring up to DH every now and again how I have these vague issues here and there. He agrees but neither of us are committed (read lazy) to actually confronting the woman we only see a few times a year. As DS gets a bit older we start letting him go see JNMIL a week ahead of us coming out to visit her. The last couple years we've let him and his cousin go out and come back without us going at all. This worked because I and DH were working full time. Free two weeks of childcare in the summer is a huge relief.\\n\\nLast year though things came to a bit of a head and I told DH that JNMIL needed some serious boundaries set. He agreed and we drafted a letter to her. It was not received well. She accused me of being a controlling/gatekeeping/GC stealing/ hormonal/ bitch. DH and his slowly shining spine defend me and himself and basically told her to get with the program or kick rocks. We go VLC throughout the year (which, yes I was pregnant with twins at the time.) she and I were completely NC and still are VVVVVVVVVVLC. DH knows I won't let her emotionally unload on our new baby (only one twin survived birth. screw preeclampsia.) and that I'm really not interested in DS going to visit JNMIL this summer. I'm home full time now so we don't need the help with childcare.\\n\\nJNMIL of course already planned on DS coming to visit and had FIL take two weeks off of work. Did they tell us the dates before hand? Nooope. Just figured we'd drive 10 hours round trip to drop DS off with no concern to our own summer plans. Well DH texts her after I said hell no. Let's her know that it's really not going to work out this summer but that she's more than welcome (ugh) to come for a 4 day weekend to see the kids. She's been a little bitchy about it. Brought back up that she forgot she has \"boundaries she's forced to bend to\" (no shit? like, that's how boundaries work..). \\n\\nThe problem I'm having here is about DS. He loves his grandma and we've done a lot to make sure he's had consistent access to her as he wants. This is the first year he won't be going out there in 10 years. Should I suck it up and take him out there? Reestablish the rules with JNMIL and hope for the best?</td>\n",

       "      <td>JNMIL is in town for LO's baptism and it's the first time I've seen her since she was here for 7 weeks after LO's birth. We saw her on Friday and she cried almost the entire time because I wouldn't let her kiss me (see my last post for the full story). After that I was VERY concerned that she would pull something at LO's baptism on Sun.\\n\\nLuckily, my JYFamily is also in town for the baptism and that made it very difficult for JNMIL to make the day about her. JNMIL usually tries to take over things, but we made sure that didn't happen. We hired a caterer and my JYFamily brought a ton of beautiful flower arrangements and helped decorate the day before. My aunt also gave a little speech and thanked everyone for coming to our party, which may have been her subtle way of telling JNMIL not to overstep. \\n\\nDespite JNMIL's bad behavior on Friday, she was on her very best behavior at the baptism party. She told me that I look stunning, that I'm a wonderful mother, and that the party was beautiful. She was laying it on thick. She even left the party at a reasonable time. I suspect that she was putting on a bit of a show (narc mask) or maybe she didn't feel like she could away with her usual b.s. with my JYFamily around. Either way, I'm very relieved that things went so smoothly for LO's baptism.\\n\\nAfter LO was born, JNMIL said some things that made it clear that she expected that LO and I would become enmeshed with her family and that my family would fade into the background. Hopefully this weekend forces her to realize that she can't push my family out of the picture. \\n\\nAnyway, I'm VERY grateful to this community- your support and advice helped me to relax and focus on LO this weekend.

       "      <td>My mil is a nutcase. Over the past 6 years, I've just kind of accepted that she is so outrageously passive aggressive and inappropriate that it's almost an art. I don't have a super close relationship with her, but I do try my best to keep her grandchildren in her life and send pictures and updates and stuff. \\n\\nI have learned to mostly ignore her passive aggressive comments and remarks and her insults thinly veiled as jokes. But there are some occasions where she is just so unnecessarily rude that I have to speak up and stop talking to her. My babyshower was one of those occasions.\\n\\n I had my daughter in early February. Her due date was March 3rd, but because of some seriously scary issues, we decided to take her early. The issues are in my post history if you want to look. Basically a rare, life threatening condition. \\n\\nSo, the shower was planned for late feb by my best friend. She and I have our issues right now, but she went above and beyond to give me a nice shower. I invited mil and she invited one of her friends. cool. So the week before the shower, all of our kids were sick. My newborn was sniffling, my 5 year old had a cold, her 5 year old had a cold, and my step mom was(and still is) recovering from lung cancer treatment. She cannot be around any sick people. We decided to push the shower back a week. \\n\\nI told my mil and she got mad. She decided she was going to do the shower herself and invite all of her friends, on the original date. I told her not to do that and that I wanted to go to my friends shower. She got mad at me, and said she had already invited everyone. I told her I did not ask her to do that, and I am not going. I tried to explain why and she just sighed and rolled her eyes. I actually felt guilty although idk why. \\n\\nThe day of my friend's shower came. MIL decided she was going to attend after all. I was at home getting myself and my kids ready and I get a text from my friend \"Rivsmama please hurry up and get here! Helppp!\" I thought to myself, \"oh shit. mil is there early. \"\\n\\n Apparently mil walked up to the door with her 70 year old friend, holding a cupcake box, and while my friend was trying to help mil's friend get in the door, mil sighed loudly and said \" you're not going to help me carry anything??!\" to my friend. She made a few other rude comments and then stood in friends living room until I got there. I found this out later.\\n\\nI show up, super happy and excited and when I walk in the door, mil makes a comment about me hogging the baby and that she's glad she came all the way here to see everyone else holding her. I ask her if she wants to hold the baby, she rolls her eyes. So I gave her to my sister in law. \\n\\nMy friend is very crafty and made some really cool decorations using felt and baby diapers. I commented on how neat they were and said, \"I wish I had the patience to learn how to do this.\" My mil scoffed and said, \"well you're a mother now, so you need to learn patience. \" I have a 5 year old and 2 older kids, but apparently I only became a mother after my daughter was born idk.\\n\\n Later on, we're playing games and my friend would start a nursery rhyme and the game was you had to finish the lyric, by writing it down. I did pretty well, but had some trouble with a couple. We were all laughing and pretending to cheat and making up silly sentences and just having fun, and my mil pipes up from the corner, \" Rivsmama don't you think as a mother you should know these? Or I guess you just don't sing to your kids. That's nice.\" I ignored her comment and kept talking to the people who actually like me. I'd be lying if I said it wasn't wearing me down though. \\n\\nNext, we did presents. This is where shit finally got to be too much. Every present that wasn't clothing, my mil would laugh and ask me if I even knew what the thing was or how to use it. Like I was too stupid to know what a burp cloth or a thermometer was. I tried to ignore her, but I finally got frustrated and said, \"Im not an idiot! Please stop!\"\\n\\nFor weeks, my mil had been hounding me to write thank you cards for all the gifts I got and the gifts I was going to receive. I'm not a thank you card type of person, I thought a genuine in person thank you or text was ok, but I was open to the idea at first. Until she started hounding me and insulting me and saying things like you're an adult now, it's time to grow up. And just being super nasty about them. So I go to open her gift, and the first thing was a package of thank you cards. She laughed and said, \"I knew if I left it up to you, it wouldn't have happened. \" And I was pissed. She had treated me like shit at my own baby shower for NO reason and I couldn't take anymore. I tossed the thank you cards to the side and said \" well sorry you wasted your money because I'm not sending any goddamn thank you cards!\"\\n\\n And she got red and started to stand up and say something, and my sister in law, who is Puerto Rican and very \"blunt\" as we lovingly describe her, had had enough. She tells mil to sit down and stop being so rude. This was supposed to be my day and she had been mean to  me since I walked in the door. My mil says, \"I'm pretty sure it's  'daughter's name' day, not mine.\" and then she did her passive aggressive laugh and a few minutes later, left. I was about to cry at this point and just wanted her gone. \\n\\nWhen she left, everyone came up to me and asked who that rude lady, bitch, jerk, etc. was and what was her problem? I stopped talking to mil for almost 2 months after the shower. She finally apologized (non apology) and I decided to just move on, and there have been some small issues since, but I'm starting to get a backbone with her. It's just growing a little slower than I'd like.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Thankfully my MIL is having very little to do with our lives lately so I have had nothing to vent about.\\n\\nYesterday there was a funny incident with her. We met them in the city as my husband had something to pick up from his father. While we were there my son found some sand and was happily digging at it with a stick for ages. She started to tell my husband how great his sand pit was as a child. For the second time this month. But my husband corrected her again and said “no it was actually not great. We used to dig up cat poo all the time” He was just laughing about it. They were kids and didn’t care at the time. \\n\\nI was a little bit away from them so didn’t hear any more of the conversation but next thing she came up and said goodbye to our son and not to me. And got in her car and started driving out of the parking space, while we were still chatting to FIL. \\n\\nMy husband takes no notice of her so didn’t even acknowledge that she had gone off in a mood.\\n\\nI asked him what had set her off and he explained that she tried to convince him that his memory of the sand pit he had as a child was wrong and there was never cat poo in it. And they didn’t even have a cat then. \\n\\nMy husband joked afterwards that he must have imagined spending all his spare time as a child making cats houses and even bring home cats when he went out to farms with his dad. Cats play such a large part of his childhood fond memories so it was extra ridiculous that she tried to claim there were none around.\\n\\nSo we will see how long she refuses to speak to him this time.

       "      <td>Here’s a (not so) quick recap: \\n\\nHot Lips is my MIL.  She was always overbearing, and nosy, but she became extremely controlling, entitled, obsessive, and passive aggressive after I had my LO almost a year and a half ago.  \\n\\nI’ll provide a few examples of her behavior.  She destroyed our first week home with LO after he was born.  She barged in on me half naked twice when she heard my LO crying and she refuses to apologize for it.  She completely disregarded boundaries we set (no kissing, no social media, etc.), and then insisted those events never happened.  I was so stressed.  I spent most of my time pumping alone so she could be with LO (I had no spine).  \\n\\nShe selected and made LO’s first Halloween costume (a scarecrow) without asking us, and then became angry when DH said we had one selected.  She snoops through our stuff, but says she doesn’t and claims she isn’t nosy.  Though she vehemently denies it, she tries to parent LO (and us), and she calls LO her baby or her son.  She’s obsessed with LO’s development, and tries to compare LO to other babies.  She’s in a one-sided competition with my parents and said something very cruel to my mom.  \\n\\nWe haven’t seen Hot Lips or FIL since before the holidays (when they made their authority figure claims), and they haven’t received any photos of LO in over 6 months (since they told us we had enough pictures of LO and refused to share a video of LO with us).  We recently got the video.  I assume this is because she’s desperate for pictures of LO.  They acted like they just forgot to send it to us.\\n\\nI haven’t responded to any communication since they wished life would go back to the way it was before DH married me.  That’s when I told them they were no longer welcome to stay with us when they visit.  They canceled their holiday visit stating that they forgot to buy tickets, but there is no way they actually forgot.  My best guess is that they’re trying to punish us, and she wants us to beg them to come.  They skipped an annual visit this spring, and didn’t even mention it.  And, MIL sent DH an email informing him that they had no plans to visit us anytime soon!  (Great, thank you.) So, she’s basically punishing herself in an effort to punish us.  She has missed out on a lot of LO’s life all because we asked her to respect our privacy and our common sense boundaries (like no swearing in front of LO), and she doesn’t think she should have any boundaries, so she reacted bitterly, refusing to accept our boundaries, making so many passive aggressive comments that I’ve lost count, and refusing to apologize because she’s done nothing wrong.\\n\\nDH quit video chatting with them a few months ago when Hot Lips asked for parenting feedback she didn’t actually want in a thinly veiled attempt to get pictures of LO.  She got defensive and angry when he gave her feedback, and after a lot of ridiculous emails, she issued a completely fake apology.  \\n\\nShe has since sent me two non-apologies where she expressed regret that I took what they said the wrong way.  She also wrote that I’m important because I’m DH’s wife and LO’s mother (I’m not sure why that was relevant unless she was just looking to insult me).  I think she’s stepping up her efforts to rug sweep because she decided she doesn’t like her current consequences and she wants everything to go back to the way it was (that’s never, ever happening).\\n\\nDH has been texting with Hot Lips and FIL a few days a week, and calling them about twice a month.  They’ve asked to video chat with LO, but DH told them they’re just going to talk for now.  DH didn’t call this weekend, but he did call last weekend.  During these calls, they have not asked about me once.  It’s clear they blame me for this situation and I’m quite certain she wishes I’d just disappear.  It’s infuriating that I’ve overlooked so much of MIL’s behavior, and I’ve been thoughtful, kind, and respectful toward them, and somehow her inability to be a decent human being is my fault.\\n\\nHot Lips and FIL recently got some bad news that they shared with DH via text.  DH responded via text, but didn’t call.  Hot Lips sent the text below this morning.  \\n\\n“We missed talking with you yesterday and we miss seeing OP and LO!!  With all of our bad news recently, it makes us so sad that our relationship is still in the pits.  What can we do?  We love you so much!  Love, your very sad parents. 😢😢”\\n\\nHow would you respond to that?  She’s asked for feedback before.  If DH tells her we need them to respect our boundaries and our privacy, she says that she doesn’t understand why we keep hitting them over the head with our boundaries.  She often ignores questions DH asks, or she reacts terribly, with mean, passive aggressive, and bitter comments, paragraphs about her hurt feelings, and denials about events that happened.  DH wants to respond, and I think he needs to be more direct this time around.  Things will never be the way they were before; they’ve destroyed my relationship with them as well as my opinion of them.  I don’t trust them and I don’t like them.  Only time will improve things, and if she keeps acting like she doesn’t know what happened, then I will never be able to move forward.  \\n\\nThank you for letting me vent, and for your advice.  ❤️</td>\n",

Please redirect me if necessary.\\n\\nSo our invites went out a couple of weeks ago and after a slight delay TTP and her flying monkeys are at it again.\\n\\n“Congrats on your engagement and your new job” TTP texted to FH.\\n\\nFull stop...Wtf are you up to lady? We all know damn well you don’t like me and you and fsil both think I’m stealing FH. (I make such a great scapegoat it might as well be my profession)\\n\\nIf you’re trying to score an invite that ship has sailed and was then engulfed in wildfire and was never seen again.\\n\\nFlying monkeys...\\n\\n“Is TTP invited”\\n\\n“Are our aunts and uncles invited? None of them got an invite? Just so you know they love and support you in everything you do.”\\n\\n(for the record he hasn’t heard directly from any of the aunts or uncles in over a year, so yeah they totally care)\\n\\nFH and his shiny ass spine.\\n\\n“You’re kidding right? Why would I invite my mother after what she’s done?”\\n\\n“Our aunts and uncles all had the chance to support me when the conflict first started, none of them did. Instead they chose to attempt to make me get back on the boat and make things right when I had done anything wrong. That totally sounds loving and supportive doesn’t it?”\\n\\nOmg ya’ll I damn near cackled at that last bit.\\nMuch love goes out to FH for not faltering.\\n\\nSo the SS Tiny Tyrannical Pterodactyl has officially began their guilt trip cruise. (This is not their maiden voyage)\\n\\nIt’ll be a delightful affair where they watch our marriage happen from a distance as they alternate between righting TTP’s boat and acting as flying monkeys.\\n\\nTiny Tyrannical Pterodactyl I know that you’re probably trying to score an invite for appearances sake. \\n\\nI mean god forbid you tell anyone the real reason you weren’t invited to your son’s wedding is because you won’t do the one thing He asked you to (counseling).\\n\\nIt’s going to be hard to keep up appearances when the wedding photos get posted and you’re not in any of them. Good luck with that.\\n\\nI’ll save you some trouble and authorize you to blame me.

Turns out we’re all nice people who treat other people like humans. Who’d a thunk it? Turns out the common denominator in all the dramatic equations is you.\\n\\nHave fun on your guilt trip cruise, and when you land on the dock at scapegoat island don’t forget to say my new last name when you go whispering about me.\\n\\nBtw guys\\n\\nI have acquired a lego Pterodactyl that now travels with me everywhere because it’s hilarious and is now on my keys. \\n\\nI wonder if LEGO makes monkeys I can glue wings to🤔</td>\n",

       "      <td>Isn't it disturbing that some Mean Girls stay that way their entire lives, even at 60+?? It's sad actually isn't it? \\n\\nWe visited MIL and FIL, who dragged us to a dinner party hosted by their friends. MIL has a crew of biddies  (picture stepford housewives but 60+ years old and South Asian). They're a tight-knit group who also gossip about each other constantly (as per FILs and SILs comments). MIL kept hinting to me that this is a \"dressy dinner\". You see, MIL and SIL are very fancy ladies who are always dressed up in sparkles and lots of florals and bright lipsticks and always have 10 layers of makeup on. No judgement, I believe we should all do what makes us feel good, but MIL was clearly worried about my debutante appearance in front of her homegirls. As a side, I think women are beautiful on a spectrum of styles and there is no one definition of femininity. I'm a young woman in tech, I love working out and hiking etc, so my style is more laidback and natural. Anyways, DH tells MIL that were not here to get fancy for a dinner party, were here to spend time with them. MIL insisted we must come to this dinner and we have to dress up. Sorry girlfriend, I don't carry such clothes for a weekend family visit and frankly I'm not your doll. So I wore black skinny jeans and a nice blouse, did my hair and makeup. My MIL CBF'd hard at me, but keep on suckin your lemons lady, you're lucky I'm even going to this shindig. \\n\\nHere's the fun part of the story. DH and I drove separately and when we got there, MIL opened the door and rushed me to the garden where the biddies were all hanging out. Y'all. I don't think I've ever been subjected to more Mean Girl attitude in my life. They each had a Sour Lemon look on their face, looked me up and down with what I would describe as disdain and made zero effort to be friendly or welcoming (I felt like I was in a movie, they were so dramatically rude). It became very clear very quickly that MIL has been talking mad shit about me to these ladies. I generally have thick skin and care very little what people I don't know think of me but it was hella uncomfortable so I dipped out of there and found DH. After telling him I'm uncomfortable and this is stupid, we told MIL we're leaving (glorious CBF ensues). \\n\\nNext day, I leave to meet a friend in that city for a few hours while DH stays with his parents. In this time, MIL started telling him a \"funny story\" about how one of the biddies is looking for a suitor for her daughter. In MILs culture, parents playing matchmaker is still a thing. MIL and FIL met in school by the way, with no parental interference and she prides herself on being a \"modern lady\". MIL starts telling DH all about the daughter, she's very pretty, working on her masters, understands their culture and .... She told her mom she had a crush on DH. MIL laughs, DH laughs and says that's weird but okay thinking that was it. It wasn't ! The \"funny story\" turns into MIL telling DH that her and biddie were talking about how they wish they could match DH with the daughter and how perfect it would be. Don't you think it would have been perfect DH ??? At this point, DH gets pissed and says I already have a perfect wife and this is weird and walks away. I get home a few hours later and have no idea about this when MIL starts chatting and also tells me the \"funny story\" but more in a \"isn't it so funny this girl has a crush on DH\". We're very secure with each other, so I really didn't think anything of it other than my MIL being her weird self and humored her by saying something about DH being a catch. \\n\\nNow that I'm processing this, I realize, it's kinda fucked up no?? Before we met, MIL and FIL tried for years to pressure DH into an arranged marriage because they were afraid he'd end up marrying outside their culture and that was MILs biggest nightmare (haha). DH ended up going NC for almost a year after they accused him of being a horrible son for not wanting to marry a stranger just to appease his parents. \\n\\nIts super insulting what MIL said though - hes a married man and she's inviting him to chat about how perfect it would have been to be with someone else instead??? We have a business we've built from the ground up together, a home, a happy life, but none of it matters because he's not with someone she approved of from her culture. Funny enough, DH and I got engaged after 6 months of dating after I hadn't even met his parents yet since they're far. He doesn't care about her approval obviously. \\n\\nWe only see MIL twice a year for a couple of days and I'm already VLC and DH is LC so I'm not bothered. But thanks MIL for continuously validating my decision to not have a relationship with you :)\\n\\n\\nEdit : thanks so much for the love and the silver !! Love this safe community!</td>\n",

Of course that means fights between parents  and kids of dresses and what's appropriate if you have a teenager you know what I'm talking about...I have two...(yes I'm going gray) the worst fight was with my SD biomom..she had arranged and was trying to force my daughter to go on a date with a boy - no way in f@#$$&amp;gt;; hell ! She will never be pressured to do anything like that, not with anyone, not by anyone. In the end, we won and she is going with my recommendation and going with a group of her girl friends. SD is just in her words not ready to date and was having a panic attack about it. Now she is happy to hang out and be a pretty young lady with her friends.\\n \\nThis reminds me of FFF. \\n\\nIF you have read the past post you can tell what a lovely and attentive mother figure she was....just a peach...- ok so you know she was anything but.\\n\\nWhen it came time to my high school dances I at 16, was well fully grown. I used to play sports and do martial arts so I was in great shape.  Never once had my mother ever taken me shopping, gotten my hair and nails done..make up...nothing. (this is relevant)\\n\\nSo one day when I come home in between school and work she walks up all nice and says oh we need to go shopping and have a girls day...all sweet - it was worse then a horror movie I knew something was up.\\n\\nI asked why? You never want to do that plus I have work and a softball game later.  She tells me we have guest and wants me to look my best. \\n\\nRemember my fellow redditors, I said my stepasswhole was a different ethnicity ... mother fell into his brain washing /mind numbing bullshit. \\n\\nI tell her no thank I have to work and my team needs me (hello short stop and power hitter plus I was trying for a scholarship) \\n\\nI go towards the door and out walks the step jerk and I swear a flock..that's what it looked like of the same ethnicity. (Which I have no problem with that's why I am keeping this as vague as possible) \\n\\nI'm stuck as I cant get in the door but this Male in his 30's walks around me like I'm some kind of....well like you were inspecting a show horse for sale. I don't like it, I dont like him either he just give me the creeps. \\n\\nThen he looks me in the eyes, sees my Irish furry as he won't let me get by and states.\\n\"So much spirit, it will be fun to break her\"\\n\\nIt clicks in my head...they were trying to marry me off...fuck this..I'm American, in America..and I'm irish.\\n\\nI spit right in his face and then punch him and knock him out. (Spitting is a severe form of disrespect) and I tell them in their language that my body is not for sale and Irish will never break...we destroy those who dare try to break us.\\n\\nI stepped over his body as he's coming around grab my work stuff and game stuff and run to work. \\n\\nI swore that day no child of mine would ever be forced to do anything she/he  didn't want especially dating.\\n\\nI heard the screaming for days...they had already received money..but they couldn't force me..and since I had made such a show now their name was mud...no one would accept me...or my sisters...or even his own daughter I had ruined the family..\\n\\nI took the punishment, the attempted beatings and they realized they couldn't hurt me anymore physically the did the one thing to make me run away which I will post later.\\n\\nSo I look at my SD smiling and think of what FFF tried to do...and how she will never ruin these moments for my family.</td>\n",

He told us that it’s obvious something is wrong and that he would love to have our case but since no charges had been brought against us he couldn’t go with us to the meeting. We talked about the stuff that was brought up here, he didn’t say much about any of it but said that our case was winnable. And it’s $2500 to retain him.  Of course.\\n\\nAlso, once we got there, the facilitator said that if we decided to bring in a lawyer they had to end the meeting and file charges. \\n\\nOn with the CPS meeting:\\nEveryone introduced themselves, there was the CPS caseworker and her Supervisor, the facilitator, a peer mentor and caseworker from some kind of drug and alcohol assessment/ treatment place.\\nThey start out by talking about everything I had put in the previous post and that the only way we could plan on getting our kids back was to agree to start this alcohol/drug assessment and it would most likely be 90 days before they would even have another meeting so the kids could come back. \\nI threw up. \\nThe kids have to stay with TCE and FIL at least for now. Their home was fast track approved. (But I mean, why wouldn’t it? It’s 3500 square foot mansion with bedroom/bathroom suites.)\\n\\nBut now I’m having to completes program too. Is this normal? None of this sounds normal to me. If we don’t comply I’m guessing formal charges will be brought? No one has said anything.  Should we do this? Should we do the programs? Should we get the lawyer? I just have no idea what to do. \\n\\nThe truth is that I have NEVER done any kind of hard drug in my life and especially cocaine. I’ve smoked out here and there, but who hasn’t? Yes, my husband has been to rehab for something completely unrelated, but he passed with flying colors and has been going to NA and doing what he should. The allegations of him driving around with the kids and doing drugs is completely false.

I don't know that this is the right sub to post in because she isn't a JN in any other situations and not sure that the below qualifies her to be one in these situations.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBUT since we've had our daughter (almost 3mo) little things are starting to bug me.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* She automatically assumes every single time that DD is hungry that we're giving her a bottle (we had issues in the beginning with weight and latching and my supply, so in the hospital they said we needed to top up with formula after each feed but that's not the case anymore and she's mostly breastfed now) and asks if we have one ready and where it is. The answer is no (because she would normally just go on my boob) and we get called silly or some comment is made about how we don't have one ready and she'll just go off and make one.. I'm not super comfortable with breastfeeding in front of others so normally let it slide and just pump once she leaves.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* She smokes. My partner and I don't. Normally when she's over it's not for that long, so to me, it's a matter of just go with smoking for an hour or two. Shouldn't be that hard? Apparently, no. So she'll go outside and have a smoke and come back inside and I hate it for DD, if it was just adults around and no baby I wouldn't care. (My partner and I have spoken about this and we are going to say from now on no one can smoke at our house - my dad also smokes).\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnd the one that annoys me the most...\\n\\n* If DD is asleep when she arrives she'll poke and prod her saying something to the effect of \"common, wake up, I want cuddles\". This drives me mad. Especially at the moment when we aren't having many or long day time naps (sleeping like a champ at night though). Like seriously let her sleep! Why on earth wake her up??

       "      <td>So it's been awhile since I last wrote about my MIL. She's the one who is obsessed with Starbucks coffee and showed up late to get her hair and makeup for my wedding because she NEEDED her daily Starbucks. She also really likes leggings, ugg boots, and pumpkin spice so DH and I joke that's she an older version of a basic bitch. I call her Starbucks Bitch. \\n\\nSo things had been pretty quiet for several months. A few BEC moments, but I hadn't seen her since October so most of it wasn't that bad. She declared herself cancer free in December (her doctor declared her cancer free in like August but whatever), but as someone here told me, she now likes to insert cancer survivor as her excuse for everything. *Sigh* She sent me a novelty sweatshirt for Christmas because it was cheap - so even though DH told her before she bought it that I wouldn't wear it, she thought it would be rude of me not to wear it. It's since been donated. She also expressed her sympathy of a death in my family by telling DH to say sorry to me, and bragging to her daughters about how she sent flowers for the funeral. She didn't and she didn't think they would mention this to their brother. When I posted the obituary online she thanked me and said it was a shame they'd never get to meet. Not “sorry for your loss”. \\n\\nAnd then came the visit. Starbucks bitch and crew (FIL, SIL1, SIL2, and GC niece) all came for a visit last month. It was planned, and I dreaded it. DH and I talked about how to handle his mother - mainly that he would keep her away from me so I didn't have to deal with her crap. But he didn't really do a good job. The theme of this visit seemed to be that if PurpleCat said more than 3 sentences MIL and her entire family would die. Or at least that seems to be the game MIL was playing.  Someone asks me a direct question, Starbucks Bitch answers. One of these questions was literally about how my family is doing. She answered even though the last time she spoke to my mom was last year.  When I corrected her she giggled and told me that didn't sound right. Like how would you know???? \\n\\nShe also corrected everything I said. Here is a list of things I apparently got wrong:\\n\\n* There is no such thing as a home warranty. It's called insurance and you have to pay double the value of a new appliance for them to fix the old one.\\n* I got the alcohol laws of my state wrong. Walmart does sell hard liquor and liquor stores are open on Sundays. It was just a coincidence that the closest Walmart and liquor stores weren't open/didn't have liquor there. \\n* The school I work for doesn't teach kids past 8th grade. I thought we taught up to 12th grade since I have to work 12th grade graduation but I'm wrong. \\n* I forgot that I should always let MIL know I have my ID on me. It was really embarrassing for her when someone I asked if I could drive home and she told them I couldn't due to lack of my ID when I corrected her. Having to announce to your MIL that you are in possession of a driver's license any time she sees you is completely normal. \\n* I didn't want veggie stir fry at the restaurant. I was clearly confused and needed the menu read to me. \\n* I'm a vegetarian so I only eat tofu. If there isn't tofu I won't eat at that restaurant. Even if I say I will. Even if I suggested the restaurant.\\n* I'm not a vegetarian and I love chicken. \\n* I didn't specify how large the margaritas were at the restaurant, and by failing to do so I misled the entire family. I was also wrong to apologize for not specifying how big the margaritas were. MIL was not trying to shame me, but was only mentioning that she only approved this restaurant because I said they had margaritas. And if I told her the truth she wouldn't have picked that restaurant. \\n* I was wrong when I said I was in severe pain at the restaurant. So it was okay for her to order dessert and another glass of wine. (Later realized I had a stress related anxiety attack- never had one before but as soon as I was away from her everything was fine) \\n\\nThese are just the things she said and did in front of me. Behind my back she asked DH if I rushed him to buy a house (sidenote - we bought our first house!). She knows he wants to move closer to her (no he doesn't) so she knows I must have rushed him. When he said no we BOTH wanted to buy a house she told him he must be confused and explained how much harder it would be to move home now. Once I was gone his entire family also told him they would support him if they needed to tell me DH wasn’t comfortable buying a house - that felt GREAT. We aren't moving because we make good money here. I also can't stand the weather in his home state. I think she’s actually angry because us buying a house means she can’t pretend DH’s goal is to move back home, and because he never asked for her help/opinion about it. She brags to her friends and family that her children always consult her about big decisions so it was really embarrassing that DH didn’t ask mommy’s opinion before making this purchase. \\n\\nOn the last day DH finally confronted her when they were alone. He basically said the ball is in her court when it comes to our relationship. He told her she needed to stop treating me like a child who doesn't know anything. I noticed she did similar things to her daughters, especially SIL2, and DH tried to rug sweep (that's just how she is). After talking he realized while his sisters love his mom because she raised them and all, I have no reason to put up with her if she can't be normal. So he added that too. He mentioned that I'm a shy person, so just because I didn't publicly call her out on her shit doesn't mean I'm okay with her behavior. \\n\\nHer response? She laughed at him and told him I'm not shy. That was it. DH was pissed she accused him of not knowing his own wife. Cue the tears and shouting “That's not what I meant!\" and “It must just be my cancer brain!” But after all that the only thing she addresses is the comment about me being shy? Nothing about me not liking her or us having a less than ideal relationship? Apparently she treats me the way her own JustNoMIL treated her. And she brags how she's nothing like that woman and how close we are. \\n\\nAt this point I'm just done with her. I told DH I will continue to be civil, but we need to keep visits to a minimum. She can never stay overnight in our home, she will never be alone with any children we have (if she's comfortable telling me I'm wrong about my own job she's definitely okay with deciding I'm wrong with how I'll parent and do whatever she wants), and all contact between us will go through him (this won't be a problem when it comes to her talking to me since she already does this, but she expects me to post publicly for her special days so she can show off how much I love her). DH agreed but he still has a problem admitting I don't like her. He still thinks we can have a relationship even though I told him I don't really want one with her at this point, but she still needs to treat me with basic respect.\\n\\nWell I don't have to see her until Christmas now, so I expect silence until then. Maybe a few more BEC moments when she talks to DH on the phone, but I'm very glad I live several states away and only have to put with this woman 2 times a year, soon to be just once a year. :)</td>\n",

       "      <td>Sorry, but this is going to be a very, very disappointing update.\\n\\nNo one's more disappointed than I am. \\n\\nSome good news is that we found a truck! It was exactly what DH wanted and not to pat myself on the back, but I mopped the floor with the car salesmen. I used my finance background to my advantage and got a pretty good deal. I'm kind of proud of myself.. this whole situation has made me a hardass. \\n\\nDH's shiny spine has withered. He unblocked his parents numbers and has added them back on social media. I never removed them from mine, so I made a post about how DH and I are strong together and how the universe can't stop what it can't catch and included a picture of us from years ago.. his family didn't acknowledge the post, but I'm sure they've seen it. I got around 100 likes so since it was popular, probably went to the top of their newsfeed. FIL has messaged DH and me, texted, called, etc. He acts remorseful. He acknowledges me at work and has been asking about our new truck and wants to come over to see it. MIL still acts like she was entitled to the truck and they didn't do anything wrong. DH hasn't spoken to her very much. He did post about his new truck when he got it. She didn't like the post, but she sent him a text saying \"what, no pictures of your truck before you put it on Facebook?\" To which he replied \"No.\" Ha.\\n\\nI think I need to give DH a little grace.. I'm very disappointed and angry, but these aren't my parents. It's easy for me to cut them off because they didn't raise me. When you're raised by a narc, I guess it's hard to cut them off? I wouldn't know personally, but DH seems to be struggling A LOT with guilt. The guilt has been eating him alive and he seems angry at me for not letting them get away with it. I guess being angry at me is easier than being angry at MIL. He's having a hard time keeping an appetite and tries to justify what they did. But there's no way around it, they betrayed him. He acknowledges their messed up priorities and how she's just not a nice person and she cheated him out of his truck. I'm trying to remind him that his adverse feelings to what they did are normal and appropriate to the situation and not to fight it, just be with it. We've started therapy individually and together. It's still new and DH is having a hard time opening up, but I think he'll get there.\\n\\nAs for SIL's car, I have no real update. We've made about 5 months worth of \"ghost payments\" without telling FIL so we're ahead on the car payments. That way, if he misses one, it's not going to hurt us. No advice is wanted on this specifically, DH isn't going to take SIL's car, even though I know it's fair. I don't really want to take it now either.\\n\\nPregnancy is going well despite all this. We'll find out the gender in a couple weeks and I have a gut feeling it's a girl. I love being pregnant and I'm starting to feel little flutters here and there that could be baby kicks, but they could also be gas lol. This situation has opened DH's eyes enough to where he doesn't want LO around his parents with the exception of some holidays. They aren't trustworthy and he doesn't want to expose LO to their selfishness. Despite all that's happening, this is a very happy pregnancy. We're focusing on the good and counting our blessings.</td>\n",

After we cut her out of our lives, the hoarding got worse. Windows and doors, the few important ones left unhindered were beginning to be filled. Another window didn't go, luckily, but they were covered nonetheless. Boxes were even shoved on top of her stove when she was found, a place she'd avoided before. Then there came a day when the boxes fell inward, but sadly not on top of her. I say sadly not because I wanted her to die, but because they blocked the remaining door instead. And she died, trapped in her house, with no longer quick access to her phone, any exits, or anyone left who would want to check on her out of love or worry, of starvation. This isn't how any of us wanted things to happen. It's not how things should have gone at all. In a long winding journey, it was debated as to whether or not DW, my BIL (her brother), and SIL (his wife) should be charged with elder neglect, but this was ultimately dropped one by one starting with my wife and ending with her brother. It was decided that she had given evidence of not being senile, had been offered the help obligated, and it was of her own volition that the hoard grew to that dangerous point. Even then, sometimes I feel maybe the police or a social worker should have gotten more involved, but they've both been contacted multiple times. \\n\\nNow, on a lighter note, some BEC from my mother.\\n\\nAs you might also recall or read in my history, my mother's a little donate happy but with *our* things. So now when she gives us gifts, we have a special box we put it in to donate since it's such a big deal. \\n\\nThank you so much for reading this, and I hope you read something happier today.\\n\\nTLDR; My MIL has died and my mother's gifts now get donated since she nags about us donating.</td>\n",

       "      <td>My MIL (and lots of other family) are arriving today for my teen's graduation. We are hosting dinner tonight at 5pm. My MIL has been asking for months to come early to \"help\". Unfortunately, her idea of helping is... the opposite of helpful. She has tried various ways to sneak into coming early, so I texted her yesterday \"See you tomorrow at 5\". She tried one more time to ask if I needed her there earlier to help and I said that we would not be home earlier.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhat do I  tell her when she shows up at my door early?

       "      <td>I posted this to legal advice and they removed it pretty much immediately. For the last several months my mother has been progressively more unhinged, and picks fights constantly. She and I have never gotten along. Last month my boyfriend and I had a fight and he moved out, causing me to be unable to pay this months rent. All month she’s been more and more verbally abusive and angry over that, and tells me to get out every single day. We have nowhere else to go, so I told her that when she filed an eviction notice we would leave. She thought that was out of spite, when it is truly out of necessity. \\n\\nLast night she picked a fight specifically to cause a reaction in me, and when I didn’t bite, she left the house. 20 minutes later, the cops showed up and said that apparently I had thrown juice at her (she grabbed my hand while I was holding it) and that I stole her phone. None of that happened, which I told the police, and the cops left. Today I spent watching the kids and cleaning/cooking. She left around 11 am. \\n\\nAround 4:30 there was a knock on the door. It was a sheriff there to serve me with a Civil Protection Order. She wanted me out, so she told a number of lies (I have a copy of what she said) alleging my “abuse” towards her. Including that I stole her phone and deleted “incriminating recordings” and “constant verbal abuse” and that I “throw things” and “impeded her egress from room to room.” \\n\\nOnly one of the things she said was actually true, and it was the culmination of a time she and I had a really long argument and I was begging her to please just listen to me. I was sobbing and I stood in front of her and she couldn’t get around me. I’m much larger than her. I expect she thinks that will go in her favor. \\n\\nAnyway, I’m currently homeless with my two kids, and I can’t find anything online pertaining to what I can do in this situation. All the info has to do with the person who filed the order. I can’t afford a lawyer, and since this is a civil case I don’t qualify for a public defender. This is wholly and completely false, and I’m terrified. I’m in Ohio. Please please help.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I’ve been a long time lurker thanks to my bestie who sends a lot of these posts to me to help me deal.\\n\\nSo I am newly married (less than 1 year) but hubs and I have gone through a ton since we got together ~4 years ago. All told, we lost both our fathers to cancer (his after a 2+ year battle, mine after ~9 months), we bought a house, got a cat and a puppy, got married, faced mental health diagnoses and debilitating back injuries, you name it.\\n\\nWhen we first got together I adored my MIL- she seemed like my biggest advocate and had a huge heart. She would stand up for me when she knew we were having problems, told me she’d love me even if I didn’t stay with him, etc.\\n\\nHowever.\\n\\nMore recently I’ve begun to see her behavior as super problematic and begun to realize the ways in which she has gaslit me into not noticing until now (even though my friends noticed way before I did).\\n\\nOn the mild end of the spectrum, MIL “pops by” to our house, often a few times a week. She makes everything about her (when a cousin had a baby in her birthday month, she said it was her bday present; FB comments congratulating us on our new puppy are about how she got to hold him, etc.). She pays for everything all the time so she can get exactly what she wants but no one can get mad at her for controlling everything because of her “generosity”. Just annoying stuff.\\n\\nThe more recent and awful bullshit is that she got engaged and told my husband via text message. Text. A group text, at that. I didn’t even get to find out from her, I had to find out from him after he was devastated and hurt by the news. \\n\\nContext: husband and I were contributing to HOA fees for a vacation property that was supposed to be for “the family” but all of Husbands ideas were immediately shot down even though he gave her hundreds of dollars and hours of his time and effort fixing up the property. He does a lot for her, cleaning her gutters and doing work on her home that she is rarely grateful for. Also, the guy she is marrying is all sorts of problematic (gives me a real “Dirty John”-minus-the-murder vibe if you’re familiar with the podcast), but that’s not relevant to this story. Husband has told her his issues with the guy and her response is always, “How long do you expect me to be miserable and alone?!” (With lots of tears, I must add).\\n\\nSo, she gets engaged and doesn’t bother to do a signature “pop in” to at least tell us in person, or at the very least call us. We also had to find out from family that she bought a $300k vacation house (she does not have the money to support multiple homes) at the request of this new fiancé. Engagement and home purchase occurred within ~2 days of each other.\\n\\nWe initiated NC after she was blowing up our phones, trying to use me to find husband. Husband sent her a text reading, simply, “we don’t want to talk to you. Leave us alone”. He also told her that we are no longer interested in being a part of their vacation property and that we needed space.\\n\\nShe couldn’t respect that and continuously called him and kept popping by our house unannounced. The last time she did it (the Friday before Mother’s Day), I inserted myself into the conversation (usually I stay out of it) because I’m just fucking done.\\n\\nShe went on and on about how we hurt her by not congratulating her on her engagement, how it wasn’t fair for us to be mad about the house because she was thinking of us when she bought it, how she was upset that I didn’t contact her after Husband asked for space. I tried explaining boundaries to her and telling her how her actions were hurtful. It seemed positive at the time and like we made a good step forward but here’s the problem:\\n\\nShe won’t stop talking about having us out to the property to visit and stay. She wants us to come with our dog multiple weekends a month, and she’s stated that “when we have kids”, she’ll watch them at the property so we can have “breaks”.\\n\\nWe have no interest in the property and Husband and I have already privately agreed that IF we have kids, we will not let her take them for extended stays on the property (which is on an island only accessible by private ferry and has no medical/fire/police services in case of an emergency).\\n\\nShe clearly wants everything to go back to the way it was, but it can’t. She doesn’t respect our personal space. No one is allowed to criticize her or her choices but she is quick to criticize my Husband and to tell me that I “act like my mother sometimes”, which she well knows is deeply insulting given my life context. She is not content with us accepting her choices even if we disagree with them, she insists that we have to be happy about them.\\n\\nHow on earth do I (and Husband) navigate this space? Husband is lost, since he has always gone above and beyond to take care of everyone in his family. I want to protect him (and myself!) but I don’t know how to do that without her deciding I’m a bitch and the enemy and turning this into a bigger issue with the family.</td>\n",

She made terrible choices with lasting consequences when I was a child and takes no responsibility. She cannot be trusted with children which is why she cannot have contact with my son. \\n\\nOn the day my baby was born she broke into my house and went through my mail to find out what hospital we were at.

       "      <td>Hello, everyone. \\n\\nMy Dad's wife feels like a MIL in that she didn't used to be my family, and I didnt choose her, but with a wedding, she was made into my family.  My MIL, although imperfect, is a kind woman with good boundaries.  My Dad's wife, however, is a source of frustration and sadness for me.\\n\\nShe is the complete opposite of my mother, who was a classy, intelligent, progressive, financially responsible woman who died 10 years ago.  She maniulated my Dad into cutting my sister and I out of his will (a story for another time - we've come to terms with it), and for a short while tried to keep him from seeing or talking to me.  After I publicly called her out over a racist post on the Book of Faces, and she unfriended me, we came to an unspoken agreement to avoid any topic we disagree about and keep our infrequent interactions polite and surface-level.  I feel like the relationship we have now is at its maximum potential.  \\n\\nShe and my Dad came to see me around Mother's Day, which coincides with my birthday, to take me to dinner and drop off their gifts for my upcoming baby shower, since she'll likely miss it due to a serious family matter.  At one point, she brought up my registry, and said that while they were shopping for the shower gifts, she noticed I'd included a breast pump.  She said that when she saw that, she couldn't help but exclaim to my Dad that \"this baby's going to starve!\" because I'm so tiny.\\n\\nI was taken aback because although I've been told that people will shame you regardless of how you feed your baby, I've heard and read so many positive things about breastfeeding that I assumed it would be more likely that I'd get shamed for formula feeding.  I have prepared responses for a lot of the expected unsolicited advice and belly touching, but wasn't ready for this.  So, I just said \"well, if I'm not producing enough, I plan to supplement with formula,\" which I do intend to do if I'm struggling for whatever reason and lactation consultants can't help.  There are formula-related items on my registry as well.  She acted relieved to hear that and dropped the subject.\\n\\nIt's still bothering me weeks later, partly because it was ignorant - a woman's size doesn't affect milk production, and partly because it was invasive and inappropriate - how my husband and I feed our child is nobody's business but our own and that of our health care team, unless we explicitly ask for input.  I wish I had responded differently, in a way that didn't seem to validate her concerns.  On top of this, my normally JY Dad's response when I expressed how difficult pregnancy has been was to awkwardly laugh and say \"well, you got yourself into this.\"  Ugh, cringe.  I'm hoping writing about this visit helps purge the negativity.</td>\n",

Edit: advice is welcome, but it’s an old story. :)\\n\\n\\nMy mother has a knack for making me feel personally responsible for her feelings. This was especially true when it came to my clothes. I’m an only child, and was essentially a doll for her when I was young. To be fair, I was a very cute kid. \\n\\nThings started going south when I turned 11/12, as they will for pre-teens. The week before the start of middle school, we went shopping for school clothes. If my mom picked something out and I didn’t like it, her response would be to take it as a personal attack on her taste, generosity, and general mothering. I was often called ungrateful and spoiled. (Side note: if I’m spoiled, and you’re my parent.... whose fault is it?) \\n\\nSo we’re in JC Penney or some other department store where I never could find things I liked, and she picks out the UGLIEST sweater I’ve ever seen. It’s chenille, but that cheap plastic-y stretchy chenille that was popular in the late 90s/00s, and it was green. Now I like green, I’m wearing a green dress right now, but this is a neon-pea electric-vomit colored mess. I hated it, and begged her not to buy it, but she was adamant that I needed a sweater and THIS monstrosity was the one I’d be wearing. I would wear it, or she would return the rest of the clothes we had just spent the last torturous hours fighting over and she’d pick out ALL of my clothes for school. Of course, I folded, and off we went, ugly sweater in hand. \\n\\nDo you think she EVER forgot to make me wear it? Of course not, she made me wear it ALL the goddamn time, including for my birthday that year. The sweater was too short, too boxy, wickedly uncomfortable, and ugly as sin, just what you want to wear as you begin puberty. \\n\\nAt some point that next summer I managed to “accidentally” rip the sleeve, and my not-crafty-at-all mother actually attempted to fix it before I pointed out that it didn’t fit (never fit) and certainly wouldn’t fit by next winter. \\n\\nShe keeps the photo of me on my birthday in that damn sweater on the wall in her kitchen so I see it every time I’m there. I think she likes to remind me of how terrible she could make me look. Someday I’m going to find a perfect match and gift it to her for a holiday, just to be petty.</td>\n",

Unfortunately I absolutely hate that name now because of how much she seems to like it and because of how often she brings it up.\\n\\nAll of this has put a damper on my excitement to meet my daughter soon because now I'm second guessing my name choice, and I don't have a lot of time left to figure out another name SO and I both are enthusiastic about. I was already kinda referring to my daughter as said name in my head and I even mentioned the name to my OBGYN who thought it was very lovely.\\n\\nI'll be honest when FMIL brought up what this friend said to us I kinda snapped back with \"well I don't know this woman or her daughter so...\".

       "      <td>\\*\\*Update\\*\\*- Instadopt got in touch with me. Aunt-in-law is showing some positive progress. They think they can hold off on surgery and she can possibly make her flight back to our home state on Sunday. Instadopt is on her way to a luau. Also, apparently they had an earthquake in Hawaii today. It has certainly been a trip for the books. \\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo my MIL Instadopt has actually been on very good behavior since my father died. I would actually label her a JustYes the last few months. I think she truly understands the magnitude of losses I have experienced and can actually see some things through my eyes.\\n\\nInstadopt's Sister my Aunt-in-law, has a milestone birthday. Aunt-in-law has been a JustNo for the last few years. To summarize things, she had uncontrolled diabetes that she refused to work on, take medication for, or heed any medical warnings for. Aunt-in-law got a blood clot in her leg at 44 yo. This was tragic. She went to have an angioplasty done on her leg. The surgeon forgot to give her blood thinners and she ended up losing the leg at 44 years old after numerous surgeries. These surgeries elevated her blood sugar and her eyesight went also (she is legally blind in both eyes now). Since then her kidneys have given out and she is on dialysis due to stage 4 kidney failure.\\n\\nI have tons of empathy for Aunt-in-law. It seemed like a horrible array of tragedies to happen to one person. However, throughout the entire process, she has been completely noncompliant in terms of eating foods she is not supposed to, refusal to take medication, refusal to attend support groups, and refusal to seek counseling or a psychiatrist for her now major depression. She managed to get her GP to proscribe her an antidepressant (she self-diagnosed and told them what she wanted to take) and has also gotten hooked on painkillers throughout this process. She was a psychology undergrad and therefore she feels she doesn't need to see a psychiatrist and can self-medicate.\\n\\nInstadopt has been by her side this whole time- at every hospitalization, doctor's appointment, taking time off of work, spending a few hours once a week at her place, calling every day, taking her in to help her recuperate from a few major surgeries. Aunt-in-law has been very selfish throughout, expecting Instadopt to drop everything and wait on her hand and foot. (This has also fed into my decision to delay kids because Instadopt wants to help with babysitting full time and there is no way she could do such a thing if Aunt-in-law needs her at any point).\\n\\nAnyway, Aunt-in-law hit a milestone birthday and Instadopt asks her what she wants to do. Aunt-in-law wants to go to Hawaii. To be fair, Instadopt has wanted to go to Hawaii for some time, but given Aunt-in-law's health issues, the distance, etc, it didn't seem wise. However Instadopt is willing to do anything for Aunt-in-law. So the trip gets booked with ravel insurance in case of Aunt-in-law's illness flaring up.\\n\\nA week ago, one of Aunt-in-law's toes on her good leg turns black. Then she gets a boil in her groin. Not long after that her doctor notices gangrene on her finger of her dialysis arm. Instadopt's DH says maybe they shouldn't go and cash in travel insurance. Instadopt tries to convince Aunt-in-law to go back to her GP or hospital to have it checked out before flight. Aunt-in-law insists a course of oral antibiotics will clear it all up. They get on a plane to Hawaii last weekend (Saturday). They arrive. Sunday morning, Aunt-in-law is rushed to the ER in Hawaii. She has been in the hospital now since Sunday and the Dr's in Hawaii says it has progressed to Cellulitis and now it may mean a toe amputation too, in addition to a strong course of IV antibiotics and surgery on the cellulitis.\\n\\nInstadopt is telling the Dr. she has to be on a plane to our home state (9 hour ride) by Sunday. Dr. isn't sure. Now Instadopt is calling travel insurance to see if they will reimburse if flights have to be changed. Instadopt planned to return to work Tuesday. That's not looking good. In any event when they do get back to our home state she will have to be immediately admitted to the hospital here. The last time this happened she was in the hospital and rehab facility for months. She has a birthday brunch planned for 2 weeks after her return.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Never though BIL was a flying monkey. My bad. \\n\\nI feel like JNMIL and Just no any family member are fools bc they want unlimited access to their grand baby’s but the grand baby will know how they are and will always pick the mommy. \\n\\nIn my case my mother had an abusive JNMIL my JNGM who I have seen 2xs in 20 years bc I can’t stand her. I know she was horrible to my mom and she was kind of a bitch to me as a kid so once I was old enough to tell her off I did. I am 35 have seen her 2 xs since I was 15. I told her off and have zero interest in her, she pretends not to be horrid but she is. We all know she is. But I’m an adult so I don’t have to see her. My daughter will never know her. For her safety and well being, NEVER won’t even know about her.\\n\\nMy mom re married and her knew MIl and in-laws suck. Are they abusive no, they are just BEC and mean girl nonsense. Her husband is great, my stepfather  an amazing human and excellent father, His siblings and their wives Just awful. So once again all of her kids (me and 3 brothers) know how they treat my mom so we don’t care for them much. Are we polite? Mostly, (I’m an adult now so sometimes I will drop a snarky comment on them like ¨ I know I don’t see you that often but I wonder why grandma tells everyone you have developmental issues, you seem perfectly fine to me” ) Do we go out of our way for them hell no.  Do we see them that much NOPE. Not even for holidays.\\n\\nSo what is the end game for my in-laws? To win my daughter over from me? That will never happen. Even though I never bad mouth them. (Just like my mom never bad mouthed hers) she will pick up my dislike of them. What do they think will happen by systematically ignoring my wishes that I will accommodate them? They are delusional. I will see them less and less which they know because I have been seeing them less and less.  You don’t want to listen fine then I don’t have to you. \\n\\nSo we are out running errands and my husband is like can we stop by to see my brother for whatever reason. I was like ok it’s just him and only for a few min. Now his mom came over last night for her weekly visit bc they were going to Athens and won’t see baby for awhile so imagine my surprise when she came outside to see The baby.  Apparently they are leaving tonight so why the rush to see the baby yesterday? Our MGG manipulation. Another weird thing FIL drove MGG over to see the baby but didn’t come inside himself.  🤷🏻‍♀️\\n\\nPretty sure this sneaky move is more on my husband triggered by MGG who has been working on him. Cause he keep asking. I told him as long as he supervises her she can visit but I won’t be their. He is like but I work. Tough cookie then, Cause as I explained she my want to see The Baby But I NEED to be respected and listened to first. \\n\\nMGG says all sorts of moronic stuff to him to manipulate him. 40 years of his moms mind fuckery is hard to break all at once. “We’re gonna die soon you have to stay in Greece forever” both of them are healthy old but healthy. This got a laugh from me when he said that to me. Cause logically it’s a fail. \\n\\nAnyways so she is their and I am like huh really. Hubby wants to do a BBQ on Sunday but they already had their visit so nope. 🤷🏻‍♀️\\n\\nSo MGG  is shrinking nonsense in whatever language at the baby and BIL is holding her whispering to her in Greek and the baby looks appalled. \\n\\nHubby is sitting next to me and I text him English so he says “could you both please speak to her in English”I follow it up with “please speak calmer to her, you can still use a nice voice but she gets agitated if you talk excitedly to her, also please use proper words it’s better for a child’s mental development” cause whatever MIL was saying to her wasn’t a word in any language. \\n\\n\\nMIL gave me a look like yeah no and BIL was like “I’m speaking Greek. She needs to learn Greek.” \\n\\nI pushed back “no she doesn’t she will learn it in school we are focusing on English with her¨ (over my dead body will she go to school in Greece. you think American schools are bad Greece is like I can top that) he pushed back again and  flat out said well “I no longer care him she learns Greek or not.” \\n\\nHusband  interjects “Speak English my wife wants to be included I will take care of teaching baby Greek” \\n\\nBIL “it’s not like I was telling her secrets” me “ regardless they are in fact secrets from me” \\n\\nWhole time MGG complaining in Greek to my husband so yes they are in fact telling secrets. \\n\\nWhen I mean speak English I mean do not speak Greek at all, to anyone in my presence. What they have done for years is would speak English to me but Greek to each other which is so fucking rude.  Honestly I am shocked they think this is ok. No they know it’s bad but I haven’t given a fuck before bc we would see them 3 weeks a year. So 🤷🏻‍♀️. Then we moved to Greece for my husbands work. They still did it but I did not care because I am not close with them and did not care enough to correct that behavior. \\n\\nNow I have a baby MIL proved she couldn’t be trusted by saying shitty things about hubby and me to The baby in Greek. Now I fucking care. \\n\\nAlso MGG then grabbed the baby from BIL and started walking awkwardly with her. Of course the baby started screaming. You have to hold her securely. I am glad my baby is old enough now to express her displeasure. \\n\\nThe hubby instantly took the baby away from MGG. On the way home he was like I wonder why that happened. - dose he really? Cause I can provide the answers. I told him and he was like no that can’t be it. 🤷🏻‍♀️  \\n\\n\\nThe hubby keeps pressuring me to let his mom come over and see the baby more. We are going to have a sit down about it tomorrow and I am trying to figure out what to say. Cause it’s not going to happen. \\n\\nI can not spend more time with that women the shrieking and disrespect I can’t. \\n\\nThe funny thing is HE doesn’t even want to. \\n\\nShe was over last night in which I went upstairs for some peace and quite. Leaving him to supervise and interact with her. He lasted 20 min. Why would he make me suffer her if he can’t even last 20 min with her. \\n\\nHe keeps saying your parents did and refuses to see the difference between them.  \\n\\nIt is  not logical at this point. \\n\\nHow do I address this so he understand?\\n\\nI point out the unsafe behaviors she has done and he is like ok I have addressed them.\\n\\nI am like but what about the next unsafe thing she does? She has proven her untrustworthiness and inability to respect even the most basic current safe parenting standards. \\n\\nAnd he says I am irrational one because I am blaming her for something she hasn’t done yet. \\n\\nI am like no I am holding her accountable for past behavior and protecting OUR child according. \\n\\n🤷🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🙄\\n\\n\\nEdit so I got 2 post on here from a Greek troll ranting about I was at fault and Greek is a beautiful language.... both accounts new... do you think it’s my in-laws stalking me because that would be so disturbing.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hello wonderful reddit friends! Today is a good day! Maybe it’s the start of a new adventure of telling my MIL back the F off! But I know it’s going to be an adjustment for my DH. Here’s the story. \\n\\nSo my phone has been dead for about two hours. Couldn’t find the charger. When I finally found it and got my phone back on, the fun began. 15 freaking text messages from my MIL in a group text with my DH came flooding in. Apparently, she decided to take her vacation during my children’s 7th birthday in about a month and a half away. Not a big deal right. Well there’s more to it. She’s not just taking her vacation the week of my children’s birthday (we already made plans) but signed my DH and I up with our kids, to go 3 STATES AWAY, out of town, to my (The Queen bee of the fly monkeys) SIL’s. She said she already told my SIL we were coming. They already told her children too. So now they are all excited to see their cousins on their birthday and 4th of July week. So now they are in the process of planning my children’s Bday party (a day before 4th of July), 3 states away,  and a 4th of July party/ graduation party for her child competing kindergarten. Apparently she had already spent lots of money on the party and reserved a party clown and bouncy house too. \\n\\nSo according to my MIL (even tho she NEVER asked us if we could go) we are going. My DH works during the week so she told him to take off work, telling his boss a out right lie, that someone died in the family. So, he has to go to a funeral out of town to be their for his mother who just lost her husband too (it will be a year ago, in a week). If that doesn’t work, then just my children and I can go. See, I don’t work. So I have no obligations to stay home. I can always come. Then she text us, what the plans are. She will be picking us up the week of my boys bday, Monday at 7am in the Morning to drive 10 hours down to my SIL’s for 5 days. \\n\\nThe fucking balls of this woman!!!!!! On top of never asking us if we can go and the fact that she knows I HATE My SIL. She ignores all the damn plans we have already made with my friend and her kids, for my children’s bday. We have not even set a day in stone for the bday bc it’s still 7 weeks away. But we did tell their one cousin, who lives 10 minutes away, my friend, and two other children what we are doing. They all confirmed they can come. We are going to have a cook out, cake, and a day at the beach (only 10 minute walk away from my house). Then come home, have a fire and camp out in a tent, in the back yard for the kids FIRST sleep over party. Nothing crazy but that’s why we haven’t set a day yet. Bc we need to plan it around the 10 day weather forecast. But everyone is expecting it to happen around their bday week. \\n\\nMy MIL KNEW alllll about this already. I told her 2 weeks ago when she asked what our plans are for my kids bday. But nope. She don’t care. We do what she wants. End of story. WRONG! I was going to flip the F out until my DH FINALLY grew a pair and stepped in. He told her the following:\\n\\n“Speechless mom. I really don’t know what to say. Except I’m sorry. We will not be joining you. You should of talked to me first.  Its a nice thought but no. Would be nice to see my sister and my nieces but not at the expense of my children’s already planned birthday party. My job mom! It’s a career! I don’t take that shit Lightly. You know how hard I worked to get were I am. If you wanted to plan a family trip, you got to TALK with me and my wife FIRST! You don’t make plans for us, 10 fucking hours away. You know I do side work too. What if I had gigs planned already. I can’t cancel. That’s my professional reputation mom and telling me to LIE about a family members death is just messed up. How do you even know, we would even have the ability to miss a whole entire weeks worth of pay!? The boys will be in soccer and science camp this summer too. Remember I told you. You know how much it costs. I got twins mom. Two summer camps on one income. They will not miss one fucking day! You knew it’s the first year they’ve ever done a camp or a sport and it’s the new neighborhood. I want the kids to make friends this summer. I want them to have a good next year in their new school. YOU will have to break the news to my nieces we will not be coming. YOU will have to fix the mess you made with my sister and any money she spent on the party she is planning. I don’t care. She ripped me off anyways when she cried the blues she had no utilities so I gave her 700 dollars she never paid back. Yea but she’s broke planning 3 parties. Whatever. I have nothing to do with this shit. \\n\\nI love you mom. You know I do. I have tried my best to keep things under control with you since your weird controlling behavior started. I’ve been trying to juggle my wife’s feelings and yours. I’ve been trying to see both sides. I do but this is wrong. It’s your way or nothing. I’m not sure why you are acting this way but it’s not ok. All your going to do is push me away. Remember I’m the only one out of all of your kids who still lives under 2 hours away from you. Everyone else is a day drive or flying distance. And If you bring dads death up as an excuse...... don’t even try it.” \\n\\nHe texted her all of this in a group text. WOW!!!! I was stunned and sooooooooooo freaking happy. She responded with, “A short no would of been fine and in private. I see what’s going on. We will talk more about this when we have some privacy. Did you forget we are in a group text? I’m very hurt. I’m very very disappointed in you. Remember you are the man of the family now that your father is gone. He asked one thing of you before he died and that was to take care of me and look out for your sisters. What would he think now😞 I understand you don’t have to come on the trip. But think about what I said bc you really hurt me son.”\\n\\nHe didn’t respond to her But he did text me.\\n\\n“There..... are you happy!? I choose you and not her. I did what u wanted. Now I feel like shit. But at least we aren’t going on the trip.”</td>\n",

Feel free to add your own to this.\\n\\nI just don't understand people and the trying to invite/throw parties and their excuse is \"But they will get you gifts!\"\\n\\nI ended up not having a Bridal Shower because my MIL wanted to throw me one (my mom lives far away) and MIL didn't even ask if my MOH was throwing one for me instead. She just simply assumed she would throw me one and invite all of her society friends that I had never met before to it. No asking me, no discussing a guest list, NOTHING! So I shut it down and said no thank you. Out comes the \"But you will get lots of presents!\" \"I do not feel right having a party with a bunch of people I don't know just so I can get stuff\". Evidently this was completely foreign to her because this is what all of her society friends did and now it was her turn to cash in. I was just floored. \\n\\nSo needless to say, I did not get a Bridal Shower because I refused to let MIL throw one for all her little friends (and in a JustNoSO moment, DH refused to let me have one from someone else as it would hurt his mommy's fee fees *eye roll* )</td>\n",

       "      <td>BF has been NC with MIL for about 7 months now. He has her number blocked and wants me to do the same. He is incredibly emotional about this and sees me refusing to block her number as me “being in contact with someone who kept me captive” (his exact words - I do not speak to her at all). \\n\\nI do not want to block her number because I want to be able to document any contact she tries to have with me. She very much blames me for BF going NC - I actually encouraged him to reach out to her on Christmas and he refused so she is wrong. So I am afraid that her anger will be directed at me if we experience an extinction burst. \\n\\nAnother reason I don’t want to block her is so that we have a heads up if an extinction burst is coming. BF had 10+ voicemails (in a blocked folder) from her yesterday but I have nothing. If she is really serious about losing her mind I think I will at least get a text and then we will know something is up. \\n\\nBF is very emotional about this and I feel bad that I am making it worse, but I am also affected by her crazy and I feel like I have a right to do what I want to do in terms of my phone. He is so blinded by his rage towards her that he doesn’t get that I am scared too, and this is how I prefer to deal with it. AITA?\\n\\nEDIT: thank you all for your responses - most were super helpful/gentle and I appreciate that. Just want to clear some things up: 1. I did block her number and BF agreed to split the cost of security cameras with me. 2. If I had not blocked her, if she were to text me I would not respond. We are not in contact whatsoever. 3. Maybe “encouraged” was the wrong word. I loathe MIL and wish BF would’ve cut contact years ago but tried not to push my opinion on him because I didn’t want to drive a wedge anywhere that wasn’t my business. He expressed his guilt about not planning to speak with MIL and I offered to change my plans to go with him so he didn’t have to go alone. It upsets me that anyone would think I pushed him towards his abuser because I don’t feel that was the case. We have both been abused by MIL and we are trying to navigate this together.

I panicked, I wasn’t sure if I should take it or not (They offered me less money than I thought I’d be working for, and I’m a little worried my hours might have gotten mixed up, but I can always ask about that) but I think I’m going to.\\n\\nBut I’m really worried over what I’m gonna tell my mom and dad.

I don’t know if that counts as refusing to let someone leave the house, so I don’t know what I’m going to do if that happens.

       "      <td>DH has now returned from his home town. \\n\\n\\nThe report on Obliviouranus (JNMIL) was completely unsurprising. She's in a \"flat spin\". Continuing to do the exact behaviours I cut her off for in the first place. I have enacted the consequences of no contact with a minimum period of 6 months.  This applies to Obliviouranus, BIL and SIL. FIL has kept the door open to talking to me and at some point I will talk to him. He is as much a victim of Obliviouranus as GMIL, DD, and me. I also dearly love him and want to have a relationship with him.\\n\\n\\nDH and I discussed how no contact can end. Taking all of your suggestions on board I said that an admittance of wrongdoing, genuine remorse for past actions, a sustained change in behaviour, and continued adherence to our boundaries for the next 6 months would be a good start. Professional help for what is looking like a textbook case of NPD would go a long way. That is unlikely given the nature of NPD and the narcissist lacking capacity for empathy and insight. I also put in a new boundary - I will not be taking on the role of scapegoat again. He wasn't even aware that's what it was and what I did at his request. I explained it in the framework of NPD and he understood. \\n\\n\\nGMIL has finally reached a place of acceptance about going into care. DH and BIL have taken the lead with her consultation and approval. I think she understands that getting away from Obliviouranus is the right move. At least in that respect I feel as though I did all I could and we got a good outcome for GMIL.\\n\\n\\nI will continue my own therapeutic journey alone.  I have suggested to DH he does the same as he needs someone to talk to as well and I'm sick of talking about his mother with him.  He was profusely apologetic about making the call to separate our family on the faaaaaamily holiday. I politely informed him that me and DD will not be going on said holiday. Discussion ensued. DH also doesn't want to go on holiday with his faaaaaamily (quelle surprise). We will do something together, Just the 3 of us, instead.\\n\\n\\nWhen we tell the faaaaamily we're not going on holiday with them there will no doubt be more tantrums from Obliviouranus. Not my circus, not my monkey's. DH can tell them. It would only cause more headaches us being there than not. Let them enjoy their holiday and the consequences of their actions.\\n\\n\\nSo, for now, it's over. Thank you again for all the supportive comments and DM's. I couldn't have taken out the trash without you all and now my part in this saga comes to an end.....I hope!!\\n\\n\\nEDIT: All y'all that said \"It ain't over\" have an updoot. Obliviouranus has finally emailed back. Did I read it? No. Didn't even open it. Moved it straight into the folder with all the other garbage I've collected about this saga. Her behaviour since sending the email, and the 9 days it took for her to reply, said more than whatever trash she's written to try and get her way on the faaaaaamily holiday. She doesn't even know we're not going yet lol. I'll wait till that bombshell drops and let DH deal with the fallout, then I might read it and laugh at her pathetically manipulative tactics. NC is NC.

       "      <td>Hi y’all, back again for the second time today. If you look back at my post history, you’ll see that earlier I posted about how Margot (my now JNMom) was upset I posted a status on bookface about my baby without informing her first, as I’m not sure how to attach previous post from mobile. \\n\\nLittle side note: I just hit 20 weeks Tuesday, had an OB visit that same day. Little girl is weighing in at 13 oz and right on track. Hubby and I are so excited! (This plays a role in this post)\\n\\n\\nEarlier today, I posted a status all excited about how baby girl was growing and how she refused to stop moving during the ultrasound. It was meant to be a happy post, and a happy time for everyone. Turns out, it wasn’t. \\n\\nMargot sends me a text stating that it would have been nice to hear the news first before posting it on Facebook. Asking why, she said because she had to find out when or after everyone else (This included my father). \\n \\nI made note to let her know that no one knew the information, including my father, before posting it. I made a comment stating that she found out just like everyone else on Facebook. She FLIPPED!! \\n\\nMargot said she wasn’t “everyone else” and should get to know before hand, because she believed we were closer than her finding out a different way. Margot went on to say how I had hurt her by saying she was just like everyone else, and how it wasn’t right that I didn’t tell her about MY baby before posting it for everyone to see. \\n\\nMargot decides to message my sister screenshots of our texts, but little known to her, I was with my sister helping out at her place. I explained my side to said sister, who agreed that I had done nothing wrong by posting without addressing my mother first. We’re both grown adults and moved away, yet Margot seems to believe she can still tell us what to do. She learned today she couldn’t. \\n\\nAfter hours of going back and forth, my JustNo step mother decides to jump in, messaging my sister and I in a group message. She begins by saying how she will not allow anyone to hurt Margot any longer, including us. Continues by saying how Margot is on the verge of hurting herself because of the drama going on and how it is strictly my fault. She made it a point that if anything were to happen to Margot, she would never forgive me. \\n\\nThis is where I had enough (as if before wasn’t the breaking point). I let my step mother know that she is responsible for getting her spouse help, and if she refused and something happened to Margot, it would be strictly her fault and no one else’s. Of course, step mother tried to deny this, saying I pushed her to do it. So, I called the cops! \\n\\nSheriff calls me to ask what’s going on after stopping by Margot’s home and she wasn’t there. Super nice guy, I explained it to him and said that I didn’t receive any direct threats from Margot, but from my step mother who was talking to her; Margot refused to answer me or my sister. Because Margot was still at work, this guy calls over to another city to have a unit sent to her work!! She was embarrassed to say the least. \\n\\nFurious about being embarrassed, Margot finally messages me and says never to do it again. I informed her that if she refused to get help, or step mother refused to get her help, than I would gladly call the cops again if it meant knowing she was safe. Margot must not have realized we knew this was her manipulation tactic, as she has used it before. Made a point to let me and my sister know she would never tell anyone before she hurt herself/committed suicide before doing so, not even step mother. \\n\\nThen the final breaking point of it all: Step mother sends a text to both me and my sister, stating that hers and Margot’s lives no longer concern us and not to get in contact with them. Uh, okay? \\n\\nMargot finds out about this in a group message between me, her and my sister. She tries to backtrack what step mother said by saying she never said that, she just wanted a break from us and that what she says goes. NOPE! Not going to work for me. I let her know that no matter how mad you may be at your children, you NEVER tell them you don’t want them apart of your lives anymore. Especially over nothing! Step mother (who has never had kids) made a comment about how I will learn when my little girl says that to me when she’s older. When asking what she meant, step mother said I told Margot she didn’t matter and was just like everyone else. The problem is, I never said either of those things. Step mother also made it a point to let us know that if anything happens to Margot, neither will text, call or email about her to let us know she is okay. \\n\\nWe finally get down to the last few texts, and I made the clear decision to cut step mother out of my life completely, and Margot and I are taking a long break. Poor sister was dragged into this by Margot and step mother, wanting her to be on their side. Both frustrated when she refused to take sides and told Margot everything she didn’t want to hear. She didn’t do anything wrong, but had it taken out on her right along side me. \\n\\nBasically, Margot got upset I didn’t tell her the baby’s weight before posting it on bookface for everyone to see, threatened to hurt herself over it and then gets pissed off when I called the cops to check on her. Step mother will no longer be apart of my life, neither her nor Margot will be getting any updates on my little girl,  and Margot and I are on a long break from any sort of communication. \\n\\nWhat was supposed to be such an exciting time has turned miserable. Only my father will get to know anything going on with the baby from here on out, and DH and I decided to keep everything relating to our little girl off bookface entirely. \\n\\nThat’s all for now! We will see how long Margot holds her silence towards me and my sister.</td>\n",

       "      <td>First time poster, so here’s a bit of backstory... \\n\\nMy MIL and I haven’t had the best relationship. She was dismissive and near silent the first time I met her, and she proceeded to tell my DH that I was using him for his money (we both worked retail and at the time I made more money than him) later that day after I had gone home. When my husband told his parents he was going to propose to me she wasn’t exactly supportive, and later that year when we informed them we would be moving our intended 2020 wedding date up two years (to save $400 a month in insurance as my husband was going to change jobs) her words were “this isn’t an invitation to have children.” She has not been supportive of our marriage and has called me his girlfriend time and time again, only truly acknowledging our marital status once. My husband worked for his uncle for a spell ((this was the job he went to that caused us to get married to save money)) before leaving that company to work for another; at a family dinner his uncle asked what the benefits of the new job were in comparison to those at his company and before my husband could answer MIL said “HE WOULDN’T KNOW, they decided “LETS GET MARRIED” instead of looking into it!!!!” It was loud and awkward and pissed me the hell off as NO ONE reacted. These are the most obvious examples of the strained relationship that are necessary to share.\\n\\nOnto the point of this post...\\n\\nSometime last year MIL (who can’t be taller than 5’ 1”) got herself a brand new yee yee truck that’s entirely too large for her; she only drives herself around as two of her three children don’t live at home and the youngest has his own truck for transport and she never hauls anything anywhere. Early this year she left my (now mostly JustNo) FIL. A few months ago she signed a lease on a duplex before checking if the yee yee truck fit in her garage. It technically fits, but she is by no means a small woman and it’s not comfortable to get in and out. She also already damaged the back wall of the garage while backing in.\\n\\nMy husband and BIL took a few loads of things while she was moving in and MIL realized that his truck fit in her garage perfectly. So she propositioned husband... why don’t we swap trucks? They would continue to pay the same truck payments (hers is less as she put more money down) because they’re due to pay their trucks off at the same time, and then once they’re paid off in full my husband and I will begin to pay her the difference.\\n\\nI said no.\\n\\nMy husband and I recently bought our first home. The neighborhood we live in is safe, though cars parked on the street are prone to being broken into. Especially if they’re brand new. My MIL’s giant truck likely won’t fit through our fence (my husband already has to pull in slowly to make sure he doesn’t do any damage) and I don’t want him parking on the street every night.\\n\\nMy husband relayed the message. About a week later she propositions him again. All the same details as before but this time we don’t pay a difference. I guess she thought that paying the difference was my big issue. I told husband no, again, for the same reasons as before. Only this time I tell him it’s neither of our fault that she chose to leave his father and rent a duplex before making sure her truck fit not is it our fault that she continues to choose such large vehicles. I suggest that she trade her truck in for a smaller vehicle and he says she’ll never do that. Annoyed, my response was “oh well 🤷🏽‍♀️” and I ended the conversation.\\n\\nToday he informs me that she’s brought it al up again. Her “new idea” is that we don’t have to pay a difference for the truck... aka the last thing I said no to. I said no again, but he can’t seem to understand why I won’t try to help his mom out.\\n\\nAm I overreacting by saying no? Is it justifiable that I’m so angry that she’s trying to play us by suggesting the same thing (twice!) and presenting it as a new, better for us plan a few months later as though she’s helping US? And why the fresh hell will she only ask him this, but never bring it up when I’m around (granted, this isn’t often as I’ve taken the opportunity to be LC with both of my in laws since they split.)</td>\n",

I know others have it way waaay worse than me but these are just the straws finally breaking backs. \\n\\nI am 23 and have lived with my boyfriend for over a year now. I’m a huge nerd and have always wanted to go to the big city comic on in my state; been something I’ve wanted to do and vocalized to both parents since middle school but I haven’t got to go yet due to financial stuff. My mom says it’s a waste of money, not fun, super crowded, etc etc. I was gonna go this year which I told her about but my Life happened and I couldn’t go and again she said it wouldn’t be fun and what not. Well get a picture and it’s my mom dressed as an Xman character that she chose due to the stripe in her hair (looked good not gonna lie) and asked how I liked her costume. I was like ok what’s it for? And she said “oh me and GC little sister are going to comic con in 2 wks. It was a spur of the moment thing.” \\n\\nClearly the hell not if BOTH of you ordered costumes 2 MONTHS PRIOR to said event after I told you I couldn’t go and ridiculed me for wanting to go in the first place. “Oh we are going to a smaller comic event first and didn’t even think about comic con until just now and GC really REAALLY wanted to go!” So she says she orders the tickets for her, GC and brother but that I can come to; tickets are sold out and again no cash. Brother doesn’t wanna go so he says I can have his ticket. Crisis averted, I get to go right? \\n\\nTurns out she didn’t order the third ticket because she knew brother didn’t wanna go even though I offered to pay her back for the ticket once I got paid 4 days later. Apparently, she didn’t have the money to buy all three tickets but was going to pay for my brothers? \\n\\nAnd now I find out from a third party that she’s been planning this huge Disney trip but hasn’t said anything to me about it. Like am I overreacting? It just hurts being excluded and being the last to know.  Thanks for making it this far!</td>\n",

       "      <td>I've been reading through this sub for some day now and I realised I got myself a full grown JNMIL. So I decided to share some of the good stories - partially to finally heal and partially to give some of you out there that it is possible to transform a JNMIL to a slightly annoying MIL. \\n\\nI met my DH when i was 19 and about to move to another city 2h away to continue my study. It was the kind of meeting where you immediately know you met your soulmate, the person you are going to spend the rest of your life with. So we did the only logical thing and decided to move together after knowing each other for only a couple of months. My parents were excited for us and on board with the plan. \\n\\nHis parents on the other hand.. well.. Let me tell you about first meeting my MIL. Before we moved in together I've seen her only once for a brief moment. She was close to her 60th birthday rocking long peroxide blonde hair, tight glittery jeans and a \"shirt\" I'd call a bra at best. She was nice I guess, but I was far too distracted by her looks to actually focus on the conversation. I won't talk too much about my FIL, just as a side note, he got the nickname Teletubbie from my parents - and that sums up his looks, attitude, behaviour and pure essence of his being. \\n\\nDH is a smart dude and over the years living with her he has became a master of avoiding triggering drama (no shiny spine was to be found there). So he never told her he is moving out, until the day he simply packed up his tings and left. Back then I thought it was an asshole move and gave him a hard time for it. I wanted a nice relationship with my MIL and was blaming him for ruining it. Boy, I was wrong. \\n\\nAfter some weeks of NC they decided to come and visit their son, to see how he lives and if he's doing ok. I did my absolute best, cleaning up for days, planing what we could do and how I'll apologise for DHs behaviour to put everything back in line. \\n\\nSo the big day came, they walk into my house without as much as saying hello to me, just focusing on their baby boy, having a short look around the place, acting like it's the worst shithole they ever seen and asking DH to go out for lunch with them. DH said something like \"sure WE will go to lunch with you.\", what made her decently unhappy(er). We sat down and had a long conversation about how my parents and family as a whole are horrible people for having some extra money, how my childhood must have been hell (my mom was putting down a pretty awesome career) and basically how everyone i ever knew was a shithed - she did her research. Then we went down the \"she is so amazing, and smart and pretty and ...\" road, followed by what i great mom she was. 4h of my life I'll never get back. But at least she talked to me, I thought. \\n\\nIt was getting dark and that meant it was almost over, we were standing in front of our apartment building and saying goodbye, and I started slowly relaxing, she even went in for a fucking hug. I thought I made it. But then it came - she turned to DH, looked at him and \"You know we love you, no matter the people you decide to let close to you. I'm telling you this is not a safe place and money makes people ugly. You should go searching for love, not money. Whenever you decide it's time for you to come back home you're always welcome, just call whenever and me and daddy will come to pick you up.\" And they left. We stood there, both, in shock. \\n\\nAnd that was the first of many JN my lovely MIL pulled. They got worse with time progressing and no one doing anything about it. But that's stories for another time. \\n\\nAlso: I'm taking suggestions for a nickname since the ones given to her by my family are too harsh and NSFW.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I'm not sure where to start on this, I'm 22F and my boyfriend (BF) is 23M and we have been together for 1 year and 3 months. We have lived together at my parents house for a year (fast I know but we knew each other before we got together officially) and we are smitten. My BF and I have discussed marriage and our future together in depth and are extremely excited about our lives. The only problem lies with my boyfriend's mum (FMIL = future mother in law) and by extension his close family (dad &amp;amp; younger brother). A bit of background about FMIL is she lost her mother two years ago in a tragic way and has unfortunately not coped with it well at all, she is in deep, deep grief and is still very affected by what happened.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy BF works as a chef, if anyone knows about that trade then they understand the hard, unfriendly hours they work. He often works 7am-10pm shifts with a 30 min break in between. He can usually squeeze one day off a week and if he is very lucky he gets two days. This has been his life since he has been 18 and he hates it. He feels he was pushed into this trade by his parents and he his very stressed and emotionally drained, when he gets a day off he likes to catch up on sleep, relax and play some video games but we have still managed to see his family at least once a month since we moved in together.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy FMIL calls my BF and asks when his next day off is, he doesn't know as his schedule is never updated un till a day or two in advance and constantly changes but he says he will tell her when he knows. He rings her and tells her the day off when he finds out and she replied asking if we wanted to meet up in the city and he said maybe but he'll text her and tell her closer to the day. It turns out my BF's kitchen chef was on holiday so he had to pick up their jobs as well as his own so he was extra exhausted this day off and just wanted to sleep. He text his mum that he wasn't going to meet up and we didn't think much of it until 2pm the next day when his was phone was blowing up with phone calls and messages from his mum and brother. He answered and she said she was in the city, where was he? He said he text to say he wasn't coming and she said he didn't and she was waiting for him. My BF said he wasn't even dressed and the call ended. His brother then started messaging telling him he knew mum missed him, how could he do that to her, a lot of things a long the line of that. He offered to take them to a meal on his next day off and everything seemed to calm down.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWe both went to the meal and it went well, no one talked about what happened and we had a fun time. A few days later there was an emergency in my family and I accidentally called 'dad' on my BF's phone instead of my own but he didn't answer. I realised my mistake and tried phoning my dad on my phone when my phone started blowing up. I was desperately trying to get a hold of my dad but every time I tried to ring him I couldn't has they where ringing me. I wasn't interested in talking to them as I was worried about my dad so I messaged the brother to please stop ringing me. He didn't stop and at this point I was frustrated and said can you please stop spamming me, there are other people in the world who have things to do, or something to that effect. The calls stopped and I was finally able to ring my dad and get ahold of him (he's okay btw) and didn't think much of it.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nA few days later my boyfriend gets a call from his mum, he puts it on loudspeaker because he was gaming at the time. The first thing she says is \"Are you with HER\" I immediately looked at him and he gave me a funny look and responded with \"no?\" and his mum said good \"I don't like her, I don't like how she talked to your brother, I think she is really rude\" my BF looks shocked and we both are looking at each other open mouth and before he can answer she says \"are you still planning on doing that engagement thing?\" and he answered \"yes\" and she said \"oh...\" in a very sad trailed off way. The call ends and we are both wondering where that came from, my BF's dad's birthday was coming up soon and we knew we where seeing them in a few days so my BF text them something like \"I don't like how you talked about someone I care for and I don't want you to start anything so we won't be coming to dad's birthday\" She responded how I should of told them that he was okay as they where worried about him because his dad got a missed call and my BF stood his ground and said that he doesn't think I was in the wrong and that he wouldn't agree with what she was saying. She then sent him this text message which has really been making me feel uncomfortable, here it is copy and pasted:\\n\\n\"You don't know how much I miss you, some nights I cry because I don't see you. I miss your smell your smile and the sound of your voice. I'm happy that you have met someone that makes you happy and sometimes that's hard for me to know someone else is giving you a kiss and a cuddle every day and I cant do that. It was so hard when I lost my mom and now it feels like I have lost you 😭\"\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI don't know where this came from, he told me her rarely saw her at home because of how much he worked. It made me think about a few things that had happened in the past with her that I didn't really take notice of. She posts about her mum on Facebook anywhere from 1-6 times a day and recently she has started adding my BF into the posts acting like he has passed on as well.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy BF texted his dad as he was worried about what his mum said he told him that she misses her family but made sure to name them all but not me. It was just strange. It has been a few days now and his dad's Birthday was today, I sent him a gift and a card from both of us and my BF text him to ask if he received it and said it was from both of us and he just replied he got it and thanks \\*insert BF's name\\* and later when he opened it he texted my boyfriend to thank him, but made sure to just put his name and not thank me either.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI am so confused as to what is happening, does she think I have replaced her son? She has always done little digs at me, like when we go out she uses a calculator app to total up our food for us to pay but we always offer to get theres and she always asked about my BF and doesn't really seem that interested in me but I just chalked that up to me being a bit new for her. It has made me feel like they where waiting for an opportunity to validate disliking me and now we're in this awkward position of not knowing what to do. If she knew how much I did behind the scenes maybe she wouldn't think of me so negatively, I have to push my BF to text them back and often end up doing it myself, he won't ring them back, I literally have to start the call and then he has no choice but to talk to them. I buy and send all the presents for his mum, dad and brother since we've been together for every occasion. I push him to visit them and talk to them when we do go but now I'm the enemy?  Also she doesn't know any of this stuff and doesn't know I am aware of what she has said.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI'm sorry this has been so long but I am really trying to stop him losing his family, but he thinks we should cut contact until they treat us equally, what are your opinions?\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR: My boyfriend's mum may think I have replaced her in his life and dislikes me but doesn't know that I am aware.

Books, blankets, etc \"for all her grandbabies to use\" that she keeps at her house. Totally fine... because they're kept at her house. Now that I'm pregnant, she's started buying clothes.

His wife is a size zero and has made it very very clear that she is nowhere near ready to have kids yet because her image is her brand and she doesn't want to give it up, at least for the next 10 years.

Turn around months later and he starts dating my \"Little sister\" ( a friend). she's a freshie and he's a senior, so slight problem in my eyes. I dont like the relationship and they have been dating for a few weeks at most. Heres where my mom comes in. She knows i dont like that relationship.

You may have noticed more flairs around the sub lately. That's because we have listened to user feedback requesting ways to allow more open dialogue between OPs and commenters. To facilitate this, we have implemented a flair system that allows the OP to let our community know their situation and what level of feedback they are comfortable with. For our community, the OP can include a trigger warning with any of these. From now on, we will require all posts to have a flair. Any post that is not will either be taken down temporarily or have a flair assigned by a moderator. If your post is taken down, you will have to choose a flair and then contact the moderators via [ModMail](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/JUSTNOMIL) to have your post restored. To help you understand the flairs, I've included the descriptions of the flairs that you can find in the [JustNoMIL Wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/wiki/index)\\n\\nThe new language you will find in the Wiki is:\\n\\n&gt;An OP can select one of the following flairs to tag a post. You are allowed to tailor your comments to fit *within reason.* Rule 5 remains in effect. Posts that are left without flair are subject to being temporarily removed, or having flair chosen for them, at moderator discretion. There are also trigger warning versions of each flair. **Trigger Warning** flairs dictate that the trigger warning be briefly described in the **first** sentence of the post.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Old Story- NO Advice Wanted (*Rather self explanatory*)  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;It's Handled- NO Advice Wanted (*While not exactly historical, the OP has the situation in hand and doesn't need advice.*)  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;RANT- NO Advice Wanted (*Sometimes, you just need to get it out. What you don't need are pointers.*)  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;RANT- Advice Wanted (*Sometimes, you need to get it out and then ask if you've missed something.*)  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;TLC Needed (*For when you've had that hard day and you just need someone to give a damn.*)  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Advice Please! (*Pointers are welcome.*)  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;LIVE Advice Please! (*For developing situations that need advice in a hurry.*)  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Gentle Advice Needed (*For those times that you need advice but are feeling a little sensitive.*)  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Am I the JustNO? (*Worried that you're the one who is behaving badly? Let your fellow community members help you figure that out. MILpologizing allowed within reason.*)  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Am I Overreacting? (*Is she a JustNo or isn't she? MILpologizing allowed within reason.*)  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Give It To Me Straight (*For when you need advice with a kick. MILpologizing allowed within reason.*)  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;New User (*Be Gentle.*)  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Trigger Warnings should be used for Domestic/Interpersonal Violence, Child Abuse of any kind, Sexual Violence of any kind, Graphic descriptions of violent situations, Suicide, Hate Speech and the actions that go along with it, Pregnancy Loss and Loss of a Child.   \n",

It's an older one, but I'll share it here for anyone who is shining up their own spine. A motivational missive maybe? I hope you enjoy.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI had a baby. Like you do. It doesn't feel like it was terribly long ago but my kid is over ten so things have definitely changed since then. Back in those days, we didn't have fancy video baby monitors or breathing sensors or any of the amazing fancy things you new moms get these days. We had a simple baby monitor. The base was in the baby's room and the receiver was either in our bedroom or the living room, wherever we were. It was a pretty good monitor, you could definitely hear what was going on in the baby's room... and so our story begins.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy parents were visiting. I didn't know what a JustNo was at that time- I knew my biological father was abusive, hence the restraining orders. But my mom was so much better than him, I didn't ever think to question what she said... until I became a mother. Then all bets were off. I lost my first baby and NOBODY was going to do anything wrong when my son was born. His health and safety came first. Anyway, my JSometimesMom and VeryJustYesSaintofAStepfather were visiting.  My mother had some opinions about our parenting decisions (things had changed since the 70's?!?!? Who would have thought?) but kept them mostly to herself. Until my aunt called her. We were all in the living room and so she took her cell into the baby's room to sit in the rocker and chat. And trash my parenting.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnd so we sat in the living room, my husband and I, (I don't remember where my JYSF was) and heard her make fun of me and my choice of... everything. And how I was overprotective and this and that. It lasted a good 20 minutes. Then she came back, completely oblivious to the fact that we'd heard the whole thing. A lifetime of rugsweeping training kicked in and I pretended nothing had happened. More time passed in the visit, she played with the baby, I fed him, my stepfather came back from probably Home Depot. And we were all in the living room when the baby had a blowout.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nDH and I took the baby to his room to change the baby and get the blowout damage under control. And while we were in there, we were very aware that anything we said would be heard over the baby monitor in the living room. Both of my parents would hear anything we said. I can't remember the specifics of what we said, but I know it was in reference to some \"suggestions\" my mother had made that were out of date or wouldn't work for us. We weren't mean or rude- just matter of fact about how it wouldn't work. When the baby was cleaned up, we went back to the living room and were greeted with the biggest, cat-caught-the-canary, smirk on my mother's face. We sat down and she said, \"You should be careful what you say in the room with the baby monitor.\"  \\n\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnd y'all. That new mom spine showed up. \"Yes,\" I said. \"We learned that when you were on the phone with Aunt.\"  \\n\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe smirk froze and then in an instant turned to horror.  Horror because her daughter dared talk back to her. Horror because she had been robbed of the gloating that she was so certain she was about to enjoy. But mainly horror because she had been sitting there stewing. And in her mind, she had worked herself up into believing that being overheard on the baby monitor was SHAMEFUL. And anyone who was overheard saying anything unflattering on the monitor deserved to be embarrassed and ashamed. So with that designated as the proper response in her mind, now that she had been caught out for that very thing, she had to be embarrassed and ashamed. And it was awesome. My JYSF chuckled and they left shortly after.   \\n\\n\\nThe end.   \n",

about 2 months ago, it’s been a dream as fair as our personal life, and we’re expecting a little bean in a few months.\\n\\nBut my MIL refuses to acknowledge that we’re married, refuses to acknowledge I exist, refuses to acknowledge my pregnancy, basically just acts like I don’t exist. \\n\\nShe recently tried to set him up with the niece of one of her friends. The poor girl shows up to MILs house with her aunt thinking it’s just a simple visit and is met with my MIL bombarding her trying to introduce them, then gestured to me, holding hands with my husband, visibly pregnant and goes “Don’t worry about her, she’s just his little slut.”\\n\\nIt made me feel like the old MTV show parental control. \\n\\nThankfully the innocent girl politely declined and told her aunt she’d wait in the car for her, and my D(ear)H packed up our things and left, telling his mother she can call him when she comes to her senses, or not at all. \\n\\n\\nFamily is very important to me but I have no clue how to handle this.\\n\\n\\nETA: my husband has never had a good relationship with his mother. I wanted to maybe try to fix that which is why up until now I’ve been maybe a little bit of a doormat. She’s never called me a name to my or my DHs face, and if she had I wouldn’t have taken that abuse, especially pregnant. But I am maybe a little weak and not as ferocious as I once was, because this baby has taken all my anger and replaced it with just crying. That’s my response is crying. I think he’s gonna be a little spitfire. \\n\\n\\nAnyway, I know that I need to just cut her off entirely and that’s what I plan to do. Thank you all for your kind, a little stern words. I hope I won’t have to post in this subreddit again, but I have a feeling I may.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   So some one you might not have the same views as I do and that's okay. I sort of would like to hear everyone's opinion on if I was over reacting?\\n\\n\\nSo this afternoon mother in law invited our family over for a BBQ. We haven't seen DH little sister for a while so DH wanted to go. So I figure I can fake liking MIL for a night. \\n\\nWell his sister(17) asked me if I wanted to walk across the street with her to the store to buy a few things. And I ask DH if he would keep an eye on DS( and he said he would. \\n\\n\\nWhen we got back from the store I walk into the house and see DS sitting next to the power outlet pulling on cords that were plugged in and chewing on them. Now he's the part we're I mention he was soaking wet. MIL poured ice chips on the floor for him to play with because she doesn't have AC and it's around 100°. \\n\\nNow i asked nicely (because MIL was right next to him and I'm on the other side of the house ) if she would grab him. Well she looked at him said he's fine he's not in any danger. Well I got PISSEd that she wasnt taking it seriously so I ran to him and I picked him up. And I packed up all of our stuff and we left all without me saying a single word to MIL. \\n\\n\\nMoments later MIL shows up at our house (a 45 minute drive away) to demand I apologize and how I disrespected her in her own house and that I was very rude because she invited us over and bought all the food for dinner. (Which we didn't eat). She always claims that he outlets are surge protector safe. Which means DS wouldn't be able to electricute himself. (I thought load of bullshit but hey I've been wrong before.)  and I explained I wouldn't apologize and that I felt like my son was in danger and that I acted appropriately. And then I asked her to leave. \\n\\nNow my husband is very upset with me for making this all a huge thing and said I should have handled myself better. So I figured I would come here because many of you all understand the justNoMIL stand point and ask you if you all thought I over reacted? \\n\\n\\nAlso I'd like to apologize for how awful this is written I'm currently in my phone and extremely exhausted from today.   \n",

reader, first time poster, also on my phone and all that jazz. \\n\\nAs most start off I never thought I’d post here. My mother in law and I were friends before she was my mother in law. She introduced me to my husband. This past weekend though, she nearly killed my son.\\n\\nWe let our son go on his first trip with my mother in law last weekend. She took him 6 hours away. As we put the car seat in the car we went over his medicine schedule since my son has asthma. We went over how important it is for him to get his maintenance medicine because, you know, asthma. Along the trip I got tons of pictures of him having fun. Everything seemed so great.\\n\\nMonday comes around and he gets home late in the evening and he has dark circles around his eyes and a cough. My mother in law leaves quickly because she still has to drop off my nephews 2 hours away.  I start unpacking my son’s bag and lo and behold there sits his medicine packs, completely untouched. I texted my mother in law and she says “ I didn’t think he really needed it, he wasn’t coughing much.” Ok first off you weren’t part of us making him therefore you DO NOT get to make medical decisions for him. Second, THIS IS WHY WE DON’T LET YOU SEE HIM UNSUPERVISED!!!\\n\\nSo we started trying to play catch up and get his asthma under control.  Spoiler, it didn’t work. Thursday we wound up in the emergency room and were sent home. Friday was his birthday and he spent it mostly asleep saying he can’t breathe. Sunday we wound up back at the hospital and were admitted. I told him to tell his mother what she’d caused and [this bitch takes zero responsibility.](https://imgur.com/a/9wbgASF) So now my poor baby has an IV (he wound up dehydrated also) and has to go through breathing treatments ever 4 hours because she “didn’t think he needed it”.  \\n\\n\\nWe’ve finally gotten his oxygen saturation up to the mid 90s (it was in the 80s) and should get discharged tonight.   \n",

My MIL called DH and asked why wasn't she told sooner, and he told her it was because he didnt want to yet. She was angered by the response, told my first child hello, and then hung up. She knew I was in the room (was stated earlier), and did not acknowledge it at all. 3 days passed, and she hasn't called, texted, mentioned me, the pregnancy, or anything of the matter. THEN she shares my social media post as if nothing happened (and has yet to speak to us about it). \\n\\n1. I feel like she called and tried to make it about her, then got upset when she didn't get the response she wanted \\n2. She's getting congratulated left and right on social media, but has yet to congratulate her own son, so I feel like the post was just for attention.\\n3. The REAL reason she didn't know sooner, is because she made my first pregnancy a living hell. She constantly made comments about me not eating enough (not true), she would act shocked when I ate around her, she kept tabs on my prenatal appointment times, and called literal minutes after every single appointment to ask how much I weigh, and shamed me the one appointment I didn't gain weight... I had a melt down in the OB office because of it. My DH telling her \"because I didnt want to\", when she asked why wasn't she told sooner was putting it nicely. \\n \\nI don't want to speak to her. I feel like at this point,  whatever she has to say is fake/forced. She is trying to act like the whole thing never happened. So NOW if we address it, she's going to act innocent. Should I address the situation anyway?   \n",

We agreed with a 1-year max goal of purchasing a space of our own. She lives in a very large 6 bedroom house by herself and seemed quite excited to have us join her. We currently occupy the 3 bedroom portion of her basement where we mostly keep to ourselves and leave her to her own routine as often as possible. In exchange for our space, we pay a small amount in rent to help with the electric, etc. bills and I have taken over most of the house and yard duties (I'm a SAHM and really don't mind, it keeps me busy). As of a few months ago, my SO and she started disagreeing. Everything from his job, his health, his parenting, his schedule, anything, really. I did my best to stay out of it, mostly because they were being quite petty with one another and I didn't feel the need to interject and cause further drama but in my opinion, she was berating him constantly. Then the small oddities started occurring. Little rules such as no drinking in her home (she never had a problem beforehand and we drink maybe once a month, if at all), not using the dish drying rack (she \\*never\\* does dishes by the way, I take care of them), not parking where we have agreed to park from day 1, only using very, very specific spots in the fridge and pantry (she also doesn't eat at home that often and has maybe a carton of milk and a few yogurts in the fridge, everything else is preperation items and leftovers from family meals that I make for everyone, including her) . All very weird, petty things that aren't even worth diving deeper into. SO and MIL by this point have had a few extremely heated berating arguments and we were finally told to move out immediately. She \"can't live like this.\" We accepted that we were going to have to use a chunk of our savings for a rental and found something that very weekend. When we informed her of our plans, she apologized and felt horrible that we would be using our funds for a rental instead of towards a home. We all agreed that we should stay. Not even a week later, SO and MIL engage in another heated argument and she threatens to call child protective services because he is abusive (for the record, he isn't abusive IN THE LEAST, not to me, not to our children, he's just fed up with her constant put-downs). This is when I finally started getting involved. When it comes to my children, I will not have someone threatening to have them removed from my custody. In hindsight, I realized later she would have no grounds for such a thing and it would be impossible to actually follow through with, but I digress. Things calmed down once again but only for a moment. While making breakfast for the family, MIL included (this is just days ago), she arrives in the kitchen to start talking down to my SO yet again. He loses it, she leaves the home out of anger, and we are left with PAGES of texts of our abusive behavior towards her and we need to be out of her house immediately (again). For the very first time in the 6 months we have lived there, I stand up for my family. I respond back to her texts with my own choice words of HER abusive behavior towards us. We get home to multiple eviction notices scattered around the home which I promptly gathered and tossed in her room while yelling at her to just leave us alone along with other choice words because by this point, I was incredibly fed up with her and her drama, especially after attempting to forgive her for the Child Protective Services threat. In front of me, she then calls the police and tells them I am threatening violence and trespassing. We gather the children and leave the house immediately. I spoke to the police officer on scene through a phone call and explain what actually happened and that we are rent-paying tenants of her home and will be returning. He agrees that we are allowed to and we go home. It's been a horror show ever since we arrived. We do not have the time, energy, or funds to move out with such immediacy (my god, we need \\*at least\\* a week to find a rental, not an afternoon). Constant eviction noticed plastered around the home, stomping about whenever we are in the kitchen, blocking my car so I cannot leave, insert a million other passive aggressive actions here. Not to mention, I am no longer allowing her near my children or myself. It's very clear she's mentally unstable and understandably, I don't feel safe around her. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nPhew, that was a mouthful. If you made it this far, bless you, you're a Rockstar Reader. We have no idea how to navigate our living situation while we rental hunt. This person we are living with is a monster. She is abusive, she is aggressive, and now she is making things up to actual police officers in an attempt to have me arrested. I am worried she will succeed, I am worried she will go after my children (I am sending the oldest to stay with my parents in another state until we find a new home, I don't want him near the drama), and I am worried she will damage or alter our things while we are not home. I have gone in and out of crying out of actual shock that a person could do this to someone else they previously (at least, seemingly) cared about. How do we do this?   \n",

It was very validating to hear that DH and I weren’t in the wrong for hosting separate celebrations for our families. \\n\\nI thought based on what happened yesterday we’d get at the very minimum a single months reprieve from MIL. Instead DH comes home from work today bearing “good” news. \\n\\nMil has apologized for lashing out at him yesterday stating she “has to come to terms” with how “it’s going to be from now on.”  \\n\\nBasically to sum up her text (I don’t have DH’s phone and I don’t want to ask for it) she’s sorry to DH, and needs time to adjust to me not wanting her around people of my religion. THIS IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL! She’s completely missed the point of us separating our parties! And not only that, but no where was there an apology for saying the things she did about myself nor my family! \\n\\nDH says he’s still upset with her but I don’t feel like he’s upset for the reasons he should be. I tried talking to him about it today but it just ended with him being defensive and saying that we aren’t hosting separate events from now on. Everyone is just either going to have to deal with it or not come because he’s not dealing with something like this again. I won’t get more into this because I know this is a DH problem at this point and that’s not what this particular sub is about. \\n\\nI’m very upset and feel like this was a nonapology from MIL. She’s more than likely going to expect things to go back to the way they were after a little bit of time has passed. I don’t think I can do that. She’s hurt our relationship very deeply at this point and I want nothing to do with her for the foreseeable future. Nor do I really want my son to have anything other than a superficial relationship with this woman. I know I can’t keep DS away from her realistically to DH she’s still his mom and he very much wants her in our sons and his life. \\n\\nNot looking forward to the next few months at all. I feel like I have a cloud hanging over me.\\n\\n\\nEdit: So I have slept on this and now I’m just PISSED. I’m mad that she thinks she can pull this crap with DH. I’m mad she threatened him with their relationship over something like this. I’m mad about her comments about me. I’m mad she hasn’t even hinted at an apology to me for the things she said. She will not be welcome in our home for some time. I deserve just as much as my husband to be comfortable in my home and she does not fit into that picture right now. She will also not be seeing myself nor my son for some time. Until she acknowledges what she said and has said behind my back was hurtful and can sincerely apologize.   \n",

Well that didnt last, shortly after we had a housewarming with my family and invited his as well and she showed up! Kept to herself basically the entire time and didn't engage in any socializing but everyone else had a great time and me and SO  just took it as closing the door on that situation.\\n\\nFast forward to this past weekend, my baby shower. My mom and aunt very graciously planned the whole thing out and it was lovely! The only thorn in my side was that MIL decided not to come. After the housewarming I was feeling good about things moving forward, she had helped us purchase the crib and things seemed to be looking up. Keep in mind that she has known the date, location, etc of the baby shower for months at this point. My mom had made an attempt to involve her in the planning and she told my mom \"no it's okay do what you want\".\\n\\nMe and SO head out towards the shower when he receives a phone call through the Bluetooth system in his car from MIL. Her first question is if we are in the car together, he says yes and they begin speaking in Spanish. Now I wouldn't consider myself exactly fluent but I think they highly underestimate just how much I actually understand. I hear her saying how she doesnt think she's coming. She doesnt know anyone, she has no gifts to bring it'll make her look bad, its too far (my mom lives about 45 minutes away), she'll be the odd one out, amongst other things that I didnt quite catch. He keeps saying \"please come, for me\" she repeatedly says no, they continue this back and forth until she eventually says okay fine. \\n\\nHis summary to me of this conversation was basically \"oh she just feels bad because she doesnt have gifts to bring since shes already given them to us, but she's about to leave\". So now I know that MIL doesn't really want to be there but am satisfied that shes atleast still willing to suck it up and come. We arrive and not 5 minutes later SO gets a text and says \"my mom cant come, she says its raining too hard to drive.\" He accepts this excuse fully however I'm confused as to why she would be attempting to leave at the time the shower began and not the 40 minutes earlier she said she was? Me and SO live not 10 minutes from her so we know the weather wasn't bad til later. \\n\\nI brush it off for the moment and enjoy the event. Later on when we head home I mention to him that I did feel hurt that she didn't show up as this is her first grand child and it was important to us. He tries to make excuses for her and confessed that she didnt feel comfortable coming. This struck a cord remembering back to her extreme lack of understanding of my anxiety (see my last post) and the fact that I've pushed through being uncomfortable for her benefit many times already and had even been considering letting her be in the room for the birth despite having no real desire for her to be there, for my SO and her since it is her first grandchild.\\n\\nAfter this I don't think I want to have her in the room. Her actions are beginning to concern me more for our future relationship and her relationship with my child. Would it be wrong of me to only have my mom and SO in the room? Am I over reacting to this situation?   \n",

is in full temper tantrum mode. Sobbing, threatening to move far far away, more crying and is now getting FIL to relay her messages because she's just so upset. Unfortunately, the guilt tripping and hearing about her tears seems to be having an effect on SO. For the life of me I can't understand why, it's her same old song and dance that we've been through many times. \\n\\nThey have accused me of some bizarre and impossible things considering our LO isn't even born yet. Obviously I'm going to deny them access to the baby at all costs. I'm going to be overbearing and strict about 'silly things like feeding and naps with the baby'. I won't let her have a phone when she's older. I'm going to be worse than nephew's mom. Blahblahblah. I don't know where any of this came from because I've never talked about any of these things with them. \\n\\nI've received texts saying that I'm portraying MIL as a monster, I'm wrong. I'm being petty and surmising horrible things. I need video evidence of her behaviour. I should have had a conversation with them (funny because they've never extended the same courtesy to me and when I have tried MIL throws a temper tantrum complete with crocodile tears, yelling and running away to slam doors because that's \"just the way she is\"). I've placed SO in the middle of this, they're now my family so I can't act this way, then it was finished off with some strange lovebombing and guilt tripping about how SO's grandma isn't feeling well. \\n\\nWorst part is that SO is definitely back in the FOG. He doesn't want to talk too much about all this shit because it 'stresses him out and they ARE his parents' but he did want to ask me if I'm okay with them babysitting once my maternity leave is up. What in the actual fuck. Obviously my response was fuck no, over my dead fucking body. We've talked in the past about no unsupervised visits. The woman almost killed our dog for god's sake, not trusting her with my fucking child. \\n\\nAll I can say is that I'm thankful for a supportive mom, sister and this community otherwise I'd be feeling pretty fucking alone right now. This is supposed to be a happy time for SO and I and this stupid woman has yet again made it all about her simply because she couldn't respect the one boundary I tried to put in place of 'I don't want to be her friend right now.'   \n",

I'm still with my kids. I have no idea what's going on with anything that Hag stirred up yet. Still feeling defeated.       \\n          \\nHere's the good news. Hag left town. Even with everything she stirred up while she was in town, she didn't even get what she wanted. She did not get a hold of my children. I don't know how I managed to keep her nasty inbred claws away from my children, but I did. They are safe for now.         \\n        \\nNot so good news. Right before she left town, she told husband \"We have rights as grandparents!\". He said this himself. I have no clue if he said it to scare me or what, but I still prevented her from getting her claws on them. I won't be surprised if she's currently preparing to sue for rights. Welp. Hag, is going to turn her GC against herself if she does it.           \\n            \\nShe went on to ambush a family  member with a new SO. I feel bad for them because ambushes from Hag are terrifying, but I'm glad she's away from us!   \n",

At least it does for those who are not me, namely the aunt in this story and the Red Rocket.\\n\\nThe same week I went no contact with Red Rocket, actually just a day or two before, I got a text from her sister. It isn’t unheard of for me to get a direct message from the sisters (there are two, they function as a set). But this was different.\\n\\nFor context the first message was accompanied by a picture of my post on a local neighborhood group (that bitch isn’t even supposed to be in because she lives in another state and it is a closed FB group). All I said in the post was that I needed cheap Christmas lights because I was planning to use my MiL’s extra but she had sold them. Also we are atheist and raise our children secularly but Red Rocket has nagged me to decorate our house for Christmas so she can see lights from inside her house. She said it wasn’t fair we could see her lights and she didn’t get the same. I love lights and was all for it.\\n\\nSo, for your reading enjoyment, I give you the time I tried to mitigate the shit Red Rocket says behind my back with the nicer of DH’s two aunts:\\n\\n**Aunt**: Did you see this  give me give me give me I'm like Red Rocket starting to hate her what a brat snot and anything else Why is it we want every thing given to us I'm sorry but that is how I feel and I thought you didn't believe in Santa and the lights and decorations go with Christmas I'm totally confused by you no wonder it is hard\\n\\n**Me**: What? Red Rocket has offered us her extra lights because she wanted us to put lights on our house. She forgot and sold them. I still want to surprise dS1 (and Red Rocket, but I can't put that in a public post that I know she will see) and I want to do it for as cheap as possible. I have bought two sets for $2 from this post so far and found a thrift shop that has them for cheaper than the store.\\n\\nThat's all the post is about. What does your message mean?\\n\\nThis is AUNT, right?\\n\\n**Aunt**: Yes and I don't appreciate you putting she forgot it is only for drama just post you are in need of extra things that is like Taking a jab at her I have to feel for Red Rocket as that would just upset her more She is already torn about leaving adding to her anxiety won't help\\n\\n**Me**: I only put that as an explanation for why I want just running off to buy new at the store. \\n\\nI don't appreciate you assuming that I am jabbing anything at Red Rocket. I am not at all angry with her and I am really heartbroken over her leaving. Before she blew up at me and called me an unfit mother and tried to interfere in my marriage (all that happened out of the blue in two days) I felt like she was a mom to me. We understand that she is homesick and just want her to be happy.\\n\\nI am trying to be as supportive of her decisions as possible and help her get wherever she wants to go whenever she wants, including moving. Every time we are together she talks excitedly about what she imagines her life will be like back in Shittsville and it makes me incredibly sad that she is leaving, but I do not want to punish her for it or have anger in any way. \\n\\nI suspect she is telling you a different version of what life was like here for her to make it easier to come home. \\n\\n**Aunt**:  Not really she is homesick she was too isolated in a big city\\n\\n**Me**: She is telling us that I am too controlling and she doesn't know why DH ever married me. She accused us of allowing the dog to sexually assault DS. She accused me of elder abuse for cursing. She's picking fights to push us away so it is easier for her to move.\\n\\nWe aren't taking the bait anymore (not since the dog incident, since it was so out there we thought it was a joke at first) and are continuing to live peacefully. I know her anxiety is high so we are trying to take her lead on contact so we don't stress her out. \\n\\nI hope you don't believe all that she says about us. The things she says when she is mad indicate that she is saying things about us that may not be accurate when she isn't mad. After your visit she started talking about how her BUSINESS stuff was us taking advantage of her but she always decided where the money went and if we were going to look for STOCK. We didn't take money from it, she decided what it would be spent on. But her feelings towards it seemed to change and we tried to go along with that too. We've tried to accommodate all the projects she has shown interest in.\\n\\nAnyway, frankly, I intend to make sure that I honor my promise to take care of her while she is here and make sure that I support her in her transition. \\n\\nI have pushed fairly hard for her to treat her anxiety because it is driving a lot of her daily life, even in retirement. I hope she finds a path to happiness.\\n\\n**Aunt**:  (no response)\\n\\nOh my god I just re-read the first thing you sent and I realized if I add punctuation it makes sense. And that you didn't mean to send it to me and you are saying you hate me. \\n\\nUm, yeah. Okay. I guess I really do know what Red Rocket says behind our backs.\\n\\n**Aunt**: No I'm saying I'm like her and basically everyone else that I'm am starting to hate everyone and their little comments I was so upset I type faster than I think and I do read things out of text sometime but I'm am still upset with this give me world and no one wants to work and earn their own way\\n\\n**Me**: So you think I am lazy because I made a post asking about Christmas lights? I paid for the damn things. Or is it because I stay home with my kids? \\n\\nIf I worked my kids couldn't go to their IMPORTANT MEDICAL STUFF. \\n\\nI don't want things given to me. I'd love to work. But my work is here making sure my kids have the best step forward in life they can possibly have. If me trying to find a deal on Facebook is so offensive to you that you feel you need to say you hate me, then maybe you should apologize. \\n\\nNo modifiers. Just an apology would be nice.\\n.......\\n\\nNo apology ever arrived. Shocker, I know. \\n\\nSo now for the pettiest or revenges. I continued to gather lights and then hit Walmart to buy strands that specifically did not match what I had already gathered. We did the worst decorating job we could. Strings hung mismatched and limply off the the windows and porch. I pooled a long red strand under the porch to make it look like someone bled out there in glowing lights. But we took all the lights that matched and put them neatly on the inside of the fence so we could see them looking nice, but she couldn’t. She could only see the front of our house and it looked like we tortured elves for fun and led a coup against Santa. \\n\\nWe left the lights up far too long. Red Rocket left 2/20 and we had them up until 3/1. I wanted to take them down 2/21 but it was snowing for a week. I also left them on all the time, no timer. \\n\\nNext year our lights will be amazing.   \n",

moved into a new house and the next day I had to go to another state with family. She came to visit during this time to “help” husband unpack. I was all for it, time without me! I had the baby with me so she didn’t get to spend time with him and extended the trip so she’d be here when we arrived. \\n\\nI get home to: things stuffed in random drawers (plus things she brought, she’s moving so we get the stuff she doesn’t want- only we don’t want it either), a table by the front door is the worst thing. Photos of her house?! And pictures of my husband as a kid. It’s not that she doesn’t realize I don’t like her taste- it’s her making it a\\nHome for herself.  \\n\\nA random workout piece I had was stuffed in the linen closet. So I pull it out to put it in the right place, and sat it in the living room until taking it to the garage. She threw it away. When I caught it she said I must not have needed it since I “got it out”. She has no concept of things having specific places, so despite her help- I had to move everything she unpacked/ even find everything. \\n\\nAnd then the big one. She sat with him one morning for me to catch a nap and i woke up to her in the living room. I walked past her to get to baby’s room and I could tell she was trying to get there first. Found baby in crib -on stomach, with two blankets. \\n\\nWe’ve been over the rules. She knows them. Because she launched into excuses. “I was closely watching him!” (From a different room?) “it was safe with my kids!” (No, it wasn’t safe then either. Even if they told you that.) “he sleeps better on his stomach!” (Yes, I know. But it’s not about comfort, it’s about safety.)\\n\\nThe the line that pushed too far “please don’t tell on me!” \\n\\nDon’t tell my husband because you know he’ll be mad? We both make the rules. She’s just his mom so he gets the honor of talking to her about things like this   \\n\\nShe left while I was at the pediatrician with baby, partially because husband called her and to avoid our anger. \\n\\nI’m hurt and don’t know what to do. Are there second chances to things like this? It makes me fearful of what other rules she’ll ignore.   \n",

She apologized, not really, but then let FIL verbally abuse me and stood back and smiled. There is more but that's the main trigger event. Oh btw we have a young DD who is now 16months and their only grandbaaaaaby. Veggie Devil (VD - MIL), has sent lies and gossiped and complained about myself and my mother from the get go but I was great when I was pregnant in her eyes, I am/was just an incubator to her. FIL is a prick too but that's for another sub.\\n\\nThe latest is we tried to go no contact obviously that didn't work for them after seeing DD at church from afar. They agreed to talk about things but then FIL blew it all up called it off. Well at a church gathering Veggie Devil had a flying monkey of of father (GFIL) come to DH and say that he needed to talk to his mother and that he doesn't need to tell (me) if he talks to her, and so on. This pissed me off greatly. Veggie Devil is a crafty bitch. \\n\\nMy mother, who is my carer, went to talk to GFIL and tell him please stay out of it and that I am really hurt by him saying what he said and that I wouldn't be bringing DD around. Well their son who we will call Uncle Asshole came into their house while my mum was there and screamed abuse at her saying he knew everything and that she and I were evil and brainwashed and manipulated DH into doing our bidding and that she is a hypocrite and an unchristian etc .. the only way he could 'know' is if VD has been gossiping and spreading lies about us. GMIL ushered him out and mum finished what she went there to do and tried explaining their daughter is a liar. My mum came home crying and talking to a minister of our church filling them in. I have never seen her this distressed and angry. \\n\\nThen at 11:30pm someone threw a rock at our front window where bub was sleeping luckily the window didn't break and the metal awning stopped it and the rock broke. We believe its GC SIL2 this is right up her valley. All of this is because of my bitch of a MIL. And her lies.\\n\\nWhen DHs birthday rolled around a couple of weeks ago she sent a long gaggy text \"22 years you came into my life and I was so happy because God brought a son to me!...etc\" \\n\\nI know this doesn't make any sense, any questions please ask, I'm just so confused and don't know what to do. All of this is MILs fault she sent the pumpkin, she tried to poison me, she never apologized, she lies saying we deny her a normal grandma relationship saying she can't see or touch DD whenever she wants, she has never offered to help, she only sees her wants. Selfish bitch.\\n\\nEdit: I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense.   \n",

Fine, DH took her to dinner then and we thought we were done. Come the actual week, she STILL kept on at DH with \"what are you doing for MEEEE on mothers day?\" Geez woman, he took you to dinner the week before when you insisted it was mothers day. DH wanted to spend the day with just our own family, because it's my first mothers day and tells her as much. \"sorry, but Sunday itself we have our own plans, I'll see you for dinner on Monday.\" Reasonable, right? NOPE. She goes on a tirade about how he's UNGRATEFUL and Monday is NO LONGER MOTHERS DAY and my favourite: \"tell your wife to STOP HER NONSENSE\". (Yes, because whenever DH says no to you, it HAS to be MY fault.) DH, bless him, stood his ground (despite me telling him to just give in to her because I was so tired of the drama) and we spent Sunday on our own and he saw her on Monday (albeit with me in a huge ball of anxiety the whole weekend afraid of what she might pull). \\n\\nMeanwhile, I guess she isn't happy with the fact that DH regularly has dinner with her once every two weeks (he has a demanding job and we have a 6 month old, we Don't have the time or energy for any more of her), because she randomly and regularly blows up his phone with texts along the following lines of : \"be firm with your wife, don't let her control you, don't let her yell at you\" etc, and these come COMPLETELY out of the blue with Zero prior context or link. There's also been  \"If you need to travel for work, Go, your wife should not hold you back, tell her off, you can't be stuck earning X amount forever, and anyway, she has a nanny. I know you can do better.\" \\n\\n SO MUCH there that is absolutely out of line.\\n\\n1. Travel? BOTH DH and I agreed when we got engaged, that neither of us would travel for work. That wasn't the kind of married/family life we wanted, so I quit an extremely good job too because it involved yearly travel. And his job has never involved travel anyway. But all that aside, it's Our decision and Nothing to do with You, so why are you telling him this?\\n2. Absolutely, cloak your insanity in pretending to be concerned about his finances. Meanwhile, this woman earns More than Both my parents combined, and is STILL taking money from DH every month. This knowing that we're now tight with a new baby and its related expenses. \\n3. \"Anyway she has a nanny\"- Wow. So does having a nanny mean he gets to slack off parenting? I have a nanny because I have a full time job. (Unlike her, she did not, And had a nanny, but hey, that's a different story altogether.) And even with a nanny, I do not believe in completely outsourcing the raising of my child, so I bring Both baby and nanny with me to work where I can still be there to keep an eye on things and see my daughter all day. And once we get home, I take over baby because again, it's MY kid. So I still parent much of the day And work And make sure DH's needs are met- dinner is always on the table for him when he gets home for instance. My God, Why do I even feel the need to have to defend myself against such toxicity?\\n4. I am going to assume by \"you can do better\", she was purely referring to his job and earning potential. But somehow, I also do know that she definitely believes he could have 'done better' in other ways too, if you get what I mean.\\n5. The whole strain of general disrespect for his wife. Amazing. And yet, you think I should respect You?\\n\\nWell, now Fathers Day is coming up and you'd think we'd be safe (she and FIL are divorced and FIL lives continents away). But NO, DH gets a text of \"Sunday is Fathers Day. I'm doing lunch. Bring the baby to my house at x time\".\\n\\nExcuse me? Not even \"would you like to come over\"? And who the hell are you to dictate when and where I should bring my baby? And more importantly, WHAT DOES FATHERS DAY EVEN HAVE TO DO WITH YOU?\\n\\nDH tells her No, we have our own plans on the weekend and he'll see her for dinner on Monday as is when they usually meet. AGAIN she throws a HUGE tantrum, sending him unending guilt trip texts when he's AT WORK, Refusing to back down and insisting she wants to SEE THE BABY and that she hasn't seen baby in a long time.\\n\\nRight. Woman, You haven't seen baby in a long time because You got mad at me for setting a perfectly valid boundary (she wanted DH to do her work for her. Literally, what She is PAID to do. DH was busy, she wouldn't take no from him, so I texted her to tell her no) and ceased all contact with me, much less arrange visits with baby. Also, you've been texting him long strings of text about how he should 'keep his wife in check' and 'not let her control you' etc etc among other things, showing blatant disrespect for me, so why would I WANT you around me much less my child?\\n\\nFinally though, she successfully guilt trips DH into agreeing to a visit this Saturday.\\n\\nDH and I discuss it and set a time for her to come over in the afternoon with limits because we already have plans to work around.\\n\\nCue the following exchange:\\n\\nDH: come over at x time on Saturday then, but we have another appointment at xx time so don't be late (she is HORRIBLE at keeping to set times)\\n\\nMIL: Where are we having lunch?\\n\\nDH: we're not, just come over\\n\\nMIL: but I need to eat. Why are you being this way, and you call yourself a Christian (seriously woman? \"I need to eat\"?? Are you incapable of feeding yourself? Grab a bite before you come over?) \\n\\nDH: lunch period is usually when LO has a nap, so we won't be going out then. You said you want to see LO so come over at that time when she will be awake\\n\\nMIL: I don't need to see LO, just (only) you \\[ie, only DH\\] will meet me at x place to eat.\\n\\nALL. OF. MY. OH. MY. GODS.\\n\\nSo tired of arguing with crazy that we gave in and DH will meet her for lunch. Way to take your son away from his family on our very precious weekends. AND his first fathers day weekend at that.\\n\\nAnd you Insist on wanting to see LO, we literally ask you to come over, and then you do another 180? My mind.. is just blown.   \n",

As many who've read my posts here may know my future MiL is crazy. Yesterday evening my fiance and I were planning on meeting up at my synagogue for a holiday event in which everyone got a free treat from an ice cream truck. Just show up, go to the truck, get anything off the menu free. Very innocent if you're a normal human. \\n\\nWell, before he left MIL, who is hyper-catholic, asked him where he was going. He told her about the event and she lost it. She went off for a while and basically told him that going to my temple is a slippery slope and that he's going to hell. In what I can only picture as the most flamboyant outrage MiL uttered the sentence \"You're risking your Immortal Soul for ice cream!\" \\n\\nMy fiance has been taking it in stride, though I can tell he's kinda upset by it too. I've been trying to be supportive but also the idea that accepting Jewish ice cream will send someone to Hell is just the funniest thing.   \n",

Long post. TL/DR; JNMIL is upset we aren't sending our DS to stay a couple weeks with her over the summer. I'm thinking of giving in and letting him go.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI have a reformed JNM who is now 100% JY(!) and my former JYMIL is now an aggravatingly JNMIL.  Make sense?\\n\\nThe important backstory is that when I met D(ear)H 8 years ago, my relationship with my mom was toxic. MIL at the time I met her seemed so JY! I was young and so sweetly naive. Ah, the lack of boundaries I had.... Well fast forward 5 years and my mom goes through some intensive therapy and consciously works on her own shit. It has been amazing. Like, I could actually tell her that I didn't emotionally trust her. She apologized - so many times over the years I've told her we're absolutely good now. \\*\\*Go to therapy! It 's the dopest of dope.\\n\\nJYMIL takes this same amount of time and basically degrades into a DARVO manipulative succubus.\\n\\nAn important piece of family info here: DH had a 2yo son when I met him. We got married when DS was 3yo. JNMIL up to that point had been the only \"rationally stable\" person in DH life - albeit she lives across the country. DS is the first and only bio grandchild she'd had (up until we had a baby this year. woop.). Of course DH is also the GC....\\n\\nConflict started brewing when we would go visit JNMIL on her horse ranch. If I would discipline DS (a toddler misbehaving? never.) She would take him out of time out behind my back and apologize to him for ME. I am DS full time mom and have an awesome bond with the kiddo. He's always been my number one and my motivation. The disrespect was shocking but I let it go as I was still newer to her family. I keep on over the years driving with DH to see her for our summer vacations. Things just subtly downgraded every time with her. She started piling on the emotional baggage. She needed you to know how much of a victim she'd been her entire career and life in general. It wasn't enough that she bled out on us adult children though, she started doing it to my DS.\\n\\nSee, that's a problem for me. I cannot stand adults who use children for emotional support. Especially kiddos who've been neglected and abandoned by their parent. Which DS had been by his bio mom when he turned 5yo. She just up and moved across the country with his half sister. She didn't call for a year. He went through a really rough time and I was the person he had to fall on as the SAHM.... I digress\\n\\nSo time goes on and I bring up to DH every now and again how I have these vague issues here and there. He agrees but neither of us are committed (read lazy) to actually confronting the woman we only see a few times a year. As DS gets a bit older we start letting him go see JNMIL a week ahead of us coming out to visit her. The last couple years we've let him and his cousin go out and come back without us going at all. This worked because I and DH were working full time. Free two weeks of childcare in the summer is a huge relief.\\n\\nLast year though things came to a bit of a head and I told DH that JNMIL needed some serious boundaries set. He agreed and we drafted a letter to her. It was not received well. She accused me of being a controlling/gatekeeping/GC stealing/ hormonal/ bitch. DH and his slowly shining spine defend me and himself and basically told her to get with the program or kick rocks. We go VLC throughout the year (which, yes I was pregnant with twins at the time.) she and I were completely NC and still are VVVVVVVVVVLC. DH knows I won't let her emotionally unload on our new baby (only one twin survived birth. screw preeclampsia.) and that I'm really not interested in DS going to visit JNMIL this summer. I'm home full time now so we don't need the help with childcare.\\n\\nJNMIL of course already planned on DS coming to visit and had FIL take two weeks off of work. Did they tell us the dates before hand? Nooope. Just figured we'd drive 10 hours round trip to drop DS off with no concern to our own summer plans. Well DH texts her after I said hell no. Let's her know that it's really not going to work out this summer but that she's more than welcome (ugh) to come for a 4 day weekend to see the kids. She's been a little bitchy about it. Brought back up that she forgot she has \"boundaries she's forced to bend to\" (no shit? like, that's how boundaries work..). \\n\\nThe problem I'm having here is about DS. He loves his grandma and we've done a lot to make sure he's had consistent access to her as he wants. This is the first year he won't be going out there in 10 years. Should I suck it up and take him out there? Reestablish the rules with JNMIL and hope for the best?   \n",

                JNMIL is in town for LO's baptism and it's the first time I've seen her since she was here for 7 weeks after LO's birth. We saw her on Friday and she cried almost the entire time because I wouldn't let her kiss me (see my last post for the full story). After that I was VERY concerned that she would pull something at LO's baptism on Sun.\\n\\nLuckily, my JYFamily is also in town for the baptism and that made it very difficult for JNMIL to make the day about her. JNMIL usually tries to take over things, but we made sure that didn't happen. We hired a caterer and my JYFamily brought a ton of beautiful flower arrangements and helped decorate the day before. My aunt also gave a little speech and thanked everyone for coming to our party, which may have been her subtle way of telling JNMIL not to overstep. \\n\\nDespite JNMIL's bad behavior on Friday, she was on her very best behavior at the baptism party. She told me that I look stunning, that I'm a wonderful mother, and that the party was beautiful. She was laying it on thick. She even left the party at a reasonable time. I suspect that she was putting on a bit of a show (narc mask) or maybe she didn't feel like she could away with her usual b.s. with my JYFamily around. Either way, I'm very relieved that things went so smoothly for LO's baptism.\\n\\nAfter LO was born, JNMIL said some things that made it clear that she expected that LO and I would become enmeshed with her family and that my family would fade into the background. Hopefully this weekend forces her to realize that she can't push my family out of the picture. \\n\\nAnyway, I'm VERY grateful to this community- your support and advice helped me to relax and focus on LO this weekend.

Over the past 6 years, I've just kind of accepted that she is so outrageously passive aggressive and inappropriate that it's almost an art. I don't have a super close relationship with her, but I do try my best to keep her grandchildren in her life and send pictures and updates and stuff. \\n\\nI have learned to mostly ignore her passive aggressive comments and remarks and her insults thinly veiled as jokes. But there are some occasions where she is just so unnecessarily rude that I have to speak up and stop talking to her. My babyshower was one of those occasions.\\n\\n I had my daughter in early February. Her due date was March 3rd, but because of some seriously scary issues, we decided to take her early. The issues are in my post history if you want to look. Basically a rare, life threatening condition. \\n\\nSo, the shower was planned for late feb by my best friend. She and I have our issues right now, but she went above and beyond to give me a nice shower. I invited mil and she invited one of her friends. cool. So the week before the shower, all of our kids were sick. My newborn was sniffling, my 5 year old had a cold, her 5 year old had a cold, and my step mom was(and still is) recovering from lung cancer treatment. She cannot be around any sick people. We decided to push the shower back a week. \\n\\nI told my mil and she got mad. She decided she was going to do the shower herself and invite all of her friends, on the original date. I told her not to do that and that I wanted to go to my friends shower. She got mad at me, and said she had already invited everyone. I told her I did not ask her to do that, and I am not going. I tried to explain why and she just sighed and rolled her eyes. I actually felt guilty although idk why. \\n\\nThe day of my friend's shower came. MIL decided she was going to attend after all. I was at home getting myself and my kids ready and I get a text from my friend \"Rivsmama please hurry up and get here! Helppp!\" I thought to myself, \"oh shit. mil is there early. \"\\n\\n Apparently mil walked up to the door with her 70 year old friend, holding a cupcake box, and while my friend was trying to help mil's friend get in the door, mil sighed loudly and said \" you're not going to help me carry anything??!\" to my friend. She made a few other rude comments and then stood in friends living room until I got there. I found this out later.\\n\\nI show up, super happy and excited and when I walk in the door, mil makes a comment about me hogging the baby and that she's glad she came all the way here to see everyone else holding her. I ask her if she wants to hold the baby, she rolls her eyes. So I gave her to my sister in law. \\n\\nMy friend is very crafty and made some really cool decorations using felt and baby diapers. I commented on how neat they were and said, \"I wish I had the patience to learn how to do this.\" My mil scoffed and said, \"well you're a mother now, so you need to learn patience. \" I have a 5 year old and 2 older kids, but apparently I only became a mother after my daughter was born idk.\\n\\n Later on, we're playing games and my friend would start a nursery rhyme and the game was you had to finish the lyric, by writing it down. I did pretty well, but had some trouble with a couple. We were all laughing and pretending to cheat and making up silly sentences and just having fun, and my mil pipes up from the corner, \" Rivsmama don't you think as a mother you should know these? Or I guess you just don't sing to your kids. That's nice.\" I ignored her comment and kept talking to the people who actually like me. I'd be lying if I said it wasn't wearing me down though. \\n\\nNext, we did presents. This is where shit finally got to be too much. Every present that wasn't clothing, my mil would laugh and ask me if I even knew what the thing was or how to use it. Like I was too stupid to know what a burp cloth or a thermometer was. I tried to ignore her, but I finally got frustrated and said, \"Im not an idiot! Please stop!\"\\n\\nFor weeks, my mil had been hounding me to write thank you cards for all the gifts I got and the gifts I was going to receive. I'm not a thank you card type of person, I thought a genuine in person thank you or text was ok, but I was open to the idea at first. Until she started hounding me and insulting me and saying things like you're an adult now, it's time to grow up. And just being super nasty about them. So I go to open her gift, and the first thing was a package of thank you cards. She laughed and said, \"I knew if I left it up to you, it wouldn't have happened. \" And I was pissed. She had treated me like shit at my own baby shower for NO reason and I couldn't take anymore. I tossed the thank you cards to the side and said \" well sorry you wasted your money because I'm not sending any goddamn thank you cards!\"\\n\\n And she got red and started to stand up and say something, and my sister in law, who is Puerto Rican and very \"blunt\" as we lovingly describe her, had had enough. She tells mil to sit down and stop being so rude. This was supposed to be my day and she had been mean to  me since I walked in the door. My mil says, \"I'm pretty sure it's  'daughter's name' day, not mine.\" and then she did her passive aggressive laugh and a few minutes later, left. I was about to cry at this point and just wanted her gone. \\n\\nWhen she left, everyone came up to me and asked who that rude lady, bitch, jerk, etc. was and what was her problem? I stopped talking to mil for almost 2 months after the shower. She finally apologized (non apology) and I decided to just move on, and there have been some small issues since, but I'm starting to get a backbone with her. It's just growing a little slower than I'd like.   \n",

about.\\n\\nYesterday there was a funny incident with her. We met them in the city as my husband had something to pick up from his father. While we were there my son found some sand and was happily digging at it with a stick for ages. She started to tell my husband how great his sand pit was as a child. For the second time this month. But my husband corrected her again and said “no it was actually not great. We used to dig up cat poo all the time” He was just laughing about it. They were kids and didn’t care at the time. \\n\\nI was a little bit away from them so didn’t hear any more of the conversation but next thing she came up and said goodbye to our son and not to me. And got in her car and started driving out of the parking space, while we were still chatting to FIL. \\n\\nMy husband takes no notice of her so didn’t even acknowledge that she had gone off in a mood.\\n\\nI asked him what had set her off and he explained that she tried to convince him that his memory of the sand pit he had as a child was wrong and there was never cat poo in it. And they didn’t even have a cat then. \\n\\nMy husband joked afterwards that he must have imagined spending all his spare time as a child making cats houses and even bring home cats when he went out to farms with his dad. Cats play such a large part of his childhood fond memories so it was extra ridiculous that she tried to claim there were none around.\\n\\nSo we will see how long she refuses to speak to him this time. He is always happy when she does the silent treatment “punishment”.   \n",

She was always overbearing, and nosy, but she became extremely controlling, entitled, obsessive, and passive aggressive after I had my LO almost a year and a half ago.  \\n\\nI’ll provide a few examples of her behavior.  She destroyed our first week home with LO after he was born.  She barged in on me half naked twice when she heard my LO crying and she refuses to apologize for it.  She completely disregarded boundaries we set (no kissing, no social media, etc.), and then insisted those events never happened.  I was so stressed.  I spent most of my time pumping alone so she could be with LO (I had no spine).  \\n\\nShe selected and made LO’s first Halloween costume (a scarecrow) without asking us, and then became angry when DH said we had one selected.  She snoops through our stuff, but says she doesn’t and claims she isn’t nosy.  Though she vehemently denies it, she tries to parent LO (and us), and she calls LO her baby or her son.  She’s obsessed with LO’s development, and tries to compare LO to other babies.  She’s in a one-sided competition with my parents and said something very cruel to my mom.  \\n\\nWe haven’t seen Hot Lips or FIL since before the holidays (when they made their authority figure claims), and they haven’t received any photos of LO in over 6 months (since they told us we had enough pictures of LO and refused to share a video of LO with us).  We recently got the video.  I assume this is because she’s desperate for pictures of LO.  They acted like they just forgot to send it to us.\\n\\nI haven’t responded to any communication since they wished life would go back to the way it was before DH married me.  That’s when I told them they were no longer welcome to stay with us when they visit.  They canceled their holiday visit stating that they forgot to buy tickets, but there is no way they actually forgot.  My best guess is that they’re trying to punish us, and she wants us to beg them to come.  They skipped an annual visit this spring, and didn’t even mention it.  And, MIL sent DH an email informing him that they had no plans to visit us anytime soon!  (Great, thank you.) So, she’s basically punishing herself in an effort to punish us.  She has missed out on a lot of LO’s life all because we asked her to respect our privacy and our common sense boundaries (like no swearing in front of LO), and she doesn’t think she should have any boundaries, so she reacted bitterly, refusing to accept our boundaries, making so many passive aggressive comments that I’ve lost count, and refusing to apologize because she’s done nothing wrong.\\n\\nDH quit video chatting with them a few months ago when Hot Lips asked for parenting feedback she didn’t actually want in a thinly veiled attempt to get pictures of LO.  She got defensive and angry when he gave her feedback, and after a lot of ridiculous emails, she issued a completely fake apology.  \\n\\nShe has since sent me two non-apologies where she expressed regret that I took what they said the wrong way.  She also wrote that I’m important because I’m DH’s wife and LO’s mother (I’m not sure why that was relevant unless she was just looking to insult me).  I think she’s stepping up her efforts to rug sweep because she decided she doesn’t like her current consequences and she wants everything to go back to the way it was (that’s never, ever happening).\\n\\nDH has been texting with Hot Lips and FIL a few days a week, and calling them about twice a month.  They’ve asked to video chat with LO, but DH told them they’re just going to talk for now.  DH didn’t call this weekend, but he did call last weekend.  During these calls, they have not asked about me once.  It’s clear they blame me for this situation and I’m quite certain she wishes I’d just disappear.  It’s infuriating that I’ve overlooked so much of MIL’s behavior, and I’ve been thoughtful, kind, and respectful toward them, and somehow her inability to be a decent human being is my fault.\\n\\nHot Lips and FIL recently got some bad news that they shared with DH via text.  DH responded via text, but didn’t call.  Hot Lips sent the text below this morning.  \\n\\n“We missed talking with you yesterday and we miss seeing OP and LO!!  With all of our bad news recently, it makes us so sad that our relationship is still in the pits.  What can we do?  We love you so much!  Love, your very sad parents. 😢😢”\\n\\nHow would you respond to that?  She’s asked for feedback before.  If DH tells her we need them to respect our boundaries and our privacy, she says that she doesn’t understand why we keep hitting them over the head with our boundaries.  She often ignores questions DH asks, or she reacts terribly, with mean, passive aggressive, and bitter comments, paragraphs about her hurt feelings, and denials about events that happened.  DH wants to respond, and I think he needs to be more direct this time around.  Things will never be the way they were before; they’ve destroyed my relationship with them as well as my opinion of them.  I don’t trust them and I don’t like them.  Only time will improve things, and if she keeps acting like she doesn’t know what happened, then I will never be able to move forward.  \\n\\nThank you for letting me vent, and for your advice.  ❤️   \n",

Please redirect me if necessary.\\n\\nSo our invites went out a couple of weeks ago and after a slight delay TTP and her flying monkeys are at it again.\\n\\n“Congrats on your engagement and your new job” TTP texted to FH.\\n\\nFull stop...Wtf are you up to lady? We all know damn well you don’t like me and you and fsil both think I’m stealing FH. (I make such a great scapegoat it might as well be my profession)\\n\\nIf you’re trying to score an invite that ship has sailed and was then engulfed in wildfire and was never seen again.\\n\\nFlying monkeys...\\n\\n“Is TTP invited”\\n\\n“Are our aunts and uncles invited? None of them got an invite? Just so you know they love and support you in everything you do.”\\n\\n(for the record he hasn’t heard directly from any of the aunts or uncles in over a year, so yeah they totally care)\\n\\nFH and his shiny ass spine.\\n\\n“You’re kidding right? Why would I invite my mother after what she’s done?”\\n\\n“Our aunts and uncles all had the chance to support me when the conflict first started, none of them did. Instead they chose to attempt to make me get back on the boat and make things right when I had done anything wrong. That totally sounds loving and supportive doesn’t it?”\\n\\nOmg ya’ll I damn near cackled at that last bit.\\nMuch love goes out to FH for not faltering.\\n\\nSo the SS Tiny Tyrannical Pterodactyl has officially began their guilt trip cruise. (This is not their maiden voyage)\\n\\nIt’ll be a delightful affair where they watch our marriage happen from a distance as they alternate between righting TTP’s boat and acting as flying monkeys.\\n\\nTiny Tyrannical Pterodactyl I know that you’re probably trying to score an invite for appearances sake. \\n\\nI mean god forbid you tell anyone the real reason you weren’t invited to your son’s wedding is because you won’t do the one thing He asked you to (counseling).\\n\\nIt’s going to be hard to keep up appearances when the wedding photos get posted and you’re not in any of them. Good luck with that.\\n\\nI’ll save you some trouble and authorize you to blame me. Anyone in your family who’s actually bothered to get to know me will know better and those who haven’t can believe what they want since they’re of no importance to me. \\n\\nMaybe I’ll talk about this with some of the nice people I’ve clicked with that you have beef with and we can all laugh about it together over cocktails. Turns out we’re all nice people who treat other people like humans. Who’d a thunk it? Turns out the common denominator in all the dramatic equations is you.\\n\\nHave fun on your guilt trip cruise, and when you land on the dock at scapegoat island don’t forget to say my new last name when you go whispering about me.\\n\\nBtw guys\\n\\nI have acquired a lego Pterodactyl that now travels with me everywhere because it’s hilarious and is now on my keys. \\n\\nI wonder if LEGO makes monkeys I can glue wings to🤔   \n",

It's sad actually isn't it? \\n\\nWe visited MIL and FIL, who dragged us to a dinner party hosted by their friends. MIL has a crew of biddies  (picture stepford housewives but 60+ years old and South Asian). They're a tight-knit group who also gossip about each other constantly (as per FILs and SILs comments). MIL kept hinting to me that this is a \"dressy dinner\". You see, MIL and SIL are very fancy ladies who are always dressed up in sparkles and lots of florals and bright lipsticks and always have 10 layers of makeup on. No judgement, I believe we should all do what makes us feel good, but MIL was clearly worried about my debutante appearance in front of her homegirls. As a side, I think women are beautiful on a spectrum of styles and there is no one definition of femininity. I'm a young woman in tech, I love working out and hiking etc, so my style is more laidback and natural. Anyways, DH tells MIL that were not here to get fancy for a dinner party, were here to spend time with them. MIL insisted we must come to this dinner and we have to dress up. Sorry girlfriend, I don't carry such clothes for a weekend family visit and frankly I'm not your doll. So I wore black skinny jeans and a nice blouse, did my hair and makeup. My MIL CBF'd hard at me, but keep on suckin your lemons lady, you're lucky I'm even going to this shindig. \\n\\nHere's the fun part of the story. DH and I drove separately and when we got there, MIL opened the door and rushed me to the garden where the biddies were all hanging out. Y'all. I don't think I've ever been subjected to more Mean Girl attitude in my life. They each had a Sour Lemon look on their face, looked me up and down with what I would describe as disdain and made zero effort to be friendly or welcoming (I felt like I was in a movie, they were so dramatically rude). It became very clear very quickly that MIL has been talking mad shit about me to these ladies. I generally have thick skin and care very little what people I don't know think of me but it was hella uncomfortable so I dipped out of there and found DH. After telling him I'm uncomfortable and this is stupid, we told MIL we're leaving (glorious CBF ensues). \\n\\nNext day, I leave to meet a friend in that city for a few hours while DH stays with his parents. In this time, MIL started telling him a \"funny story\" about how one of the biddies is looking for a suitor for her daughter. In MILs culture, parents playing matchmaker is still a thing. MIL and FIL met in school by the way, with no parental interference and she prides herself on being a \"modern lady\". MIL starts telling DH all about the daughter, she's very pretty, working on her masters, understands their culture and .... She told her mom she had a crush on DH. MIL laughs, DH laughs and says that's weird but okay thinking that was it. It wasn't ! The \"funny story\" turns into MIL telling DH that her and biddie were talking about how they wish they could match DH with the daughter and how perfect it would be. Don't you think it would have been perfect DH ??? At this point, DH gets pissed and says I already have a perfect wife and this is weird and walks away. I get home a few hours later and have no idea about this when MIL starts chatting and also tells me the \"funny story\" but more in a \"isn't it so funny this girl has a crush on DH\". We're very secure with each other, so I really didn't think anything of it other than my MIL being her weird self and humored her by saying something about DH being a catch. \\n\\nNow that I'm processing this, I realize, it's kinda fucked up no?? Before we met, MIL and FIL tried for years to pressure DH into an arranged marriage because they were afraid he'd end up marrying outside their culture and that was MILs biggest nightmare (haha). DH ended up going NC for almost a year after they accused him of being a horrible son for not wanting to marry a stranger just to appease his parents. \\n\\nIts super insulting what MIL said though - hes a married man and she's inviting him to chat about how perfect it would have been to be with someone else instead??? We have a business we've built from the ground up together, a home, a happy life, but none of it matters because he's not with someone she approved of from her culture. Funny enough, DH and I got engaged after 6 months of dating after I hadn't even met his parents yet since they're far. He doesn't care about her approval obviously. \\n\\nWe only see MIL twice a year for a couple of days and I'm already VLC and DH is LC so I'm not bothered. But thanks MIL for continuously validating my decision to not have a relationship with you :)\\n\\n\\nEdit : thanks so much for the love and the silver !! Love this safe community!   \n",

Of course that means fights between parents  and kids of dresses and what's appropriate if you have a teenager you know what I'm talking about...I have two...(yes I'm going gray) the worst fight was with my SD biomom..she had arranged and was trying to force my daughter to go on a date with a boy - no way in f@#$$&gt;; hell ! She will never be pressured to do anything like that, not with anyone, not by anyone. In the end, we won and she is going with my recommendation and going with a group of her girl friends. SD is just in her words not ready to date and was having a panic attack about it. Now she is happy to hang out and be a pretty young lady with her friends.\\n \\nThis reminds me of FFF. \\n\\nIF you have read the past post you can tell what a lovely and attentive mother figure she was....just a peach...- ok so you know she was anything but.\\n\\nWhen it came time to my high school dances I at 16, was well fully grown. I used to play sports and do martial arts so I was in great shape.  Never once had my mother ever taken me shopping, gotten my hair and nails done..make up...nothing. (this is relevant)\\n\\nSo one day when I come home in between school and work she walks up all nice and says oh we need to go shopping and have a girls day...all sweet - it was worse then a horror movie I knew something was up.\\n\\nI asked why? You never want to do that plus I have work and a softball game later.  She tells me we have guest and wants me to look my best. \\n\\nRemember my fellow redditors, I said my stepasswhole was a different ethnicity ... mother fell into his brain washing /mind numbing bullshit. \\n\\nI tell her no thank I have to work and my team needs me (hello short stop and power hitter plus I was trying for a scholarship) \\n\\nI go towards the door and out walks the step jerk and I swear a flock..that's what it looked like of the same ethnicity. (Which I have no problem with that's why I am keeping this as vague as possible) \\n\\nI'm stuck as I cant get in the door but this Male in his 30's walks around me like I'm some kind of....well like you were inspecting a show horse for sale. I don't like it, I dont like him either he just give me the creeps. \\n\\nThen he looks me in the eyes, sees my Irish furry as he won't let me get by and states.\\n\"So much spirit, it will be fun to break her\"\\n\\nIt clicks in my head...they were trying to marry me off...fuck this..I'm American, in America..and I'm irish.\\n\\nI spit right in his face and then punch him and knock him out. (Spitting is a severe form of disrespect) and I tell them in their language that my body is not for sale and Irish will never break...we destroy those who dare try to break us.\\n\\nI stepped over his body as he's coming around grab my work stuff and game stuff and run to work. \\n\\nI swore that day no child of mine would ever be forced to do anything she/he  didn't want especially dating.\\n\\nI heard the screaming for days...they had already received money..but they couldn't force me..and since I had made such a show now their name was mud...no one would accept me...or my sisters...or even his own daughter I had ruined the family..\\n\\nI took the punishment, the attempted beatings and they realized they couldn't hurt me anymore physically the did the one thing to make me run away which I will post later.\\n\\nSo I look at my SD smiling and think of what FFF tried to do...and how she will never ruin these moments for my family.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                      We had the meeting with our lawyer at 915 this morning and we pled our case. He told us that it’s obvious something is wrong and that he would love to have our case but since no charges had been brought against us he couldn’t go with us to the meeting. We talked about the stuff that was brought up here, he didn’t say much about any of it but said that our case was winnable. And it’s $2500 to retain him.  Of course.\\n\\nAlso, once we got there, the facilitator said that if we decided to bring in a lawyer they had to end the meeting and file charges. \\n\\nOn with the CPS meeting:\\nEveryone introduced themselves, there was the CPS caseworker and her Supervisor, the facilitator, a peer mentor and caseworker from some kind of drug and alcohol assessment/ treatment place.\\nThey start out by talking about everything I had put in the previous post and that the only way we could plan on getting our kids back was to agree to start this alcohol/drug assessment and it would most likely be 90 days before they would even have another meeting so the kids could come back. \\nI threw up. \\nThe kids have to stay with TCE and FIL at least for now. Their home was fast track approved. (But I mean, why wouldn’t it? It’s 3500 square foot mansion with bedroom/bathroom suites.)\\n\\nBut now I’m having to completes program too. Is this normal? None of this sounds normal to me. If we don’t comply I’m guessing formal charges will be brought? No one has said anything.  Should we do this? Should we do the programs? Should we get the lawyer? I just have no idea what to do. \\n\\nThe truth is that I have NEVER done any kind of hard drug in my life and especially cocaine. I’ve smoked out here and there, but who hasn’t? Yes, my husband has been to rehab for something completely unrelated, but he passed with flying colors and has been going to NA and doing what he should. The allegations of him driving around with the kids and doing drugs is completely false. I have done everything in my power to protect them from what was going on with my husband during all of his struggles. We may not have been The Cleavers before this but we were happy.   \n",

my phone. Sorry for formatting.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHonestly my MIL (my partner and I aren't married/engaged) isn't bad. I do like her. I don't know that this is the right sub to post in because she isn't a JN in any other situations and not sure that the below qualifies her to be one in these situations.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBUT since we've had our daughter (almost 3mo) little things are starting to bug me.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* She automatically assumes every single time that DD is hungry that we're giving her a bottle (we had issues in the beginning with weight and latching and my supply, so in the hospital they said we needed to top up with formula after each feed but that's not the case anymore and she's mostly breastfed now) and asks if we have one ready and where it is. The answer is no (because she would normally just go on my boob) and we get called silly or some comment is made about how we don't have one ready and she'll just go off and make one.. I'm not super comfortable with breastfeeding in front of others so normally let it slide and just pump once she leaves.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* She smokes. My partner and I don't. Normally when she's over it's not for that long, so to me, it's a matter of just go with smoking for an hour or two. Shouldn't be that hard? Apparently, no. So she'll go outside and have a smoke and come back inside and I hate it for DD, if it was just adults around and no baby I wouldn't care. (My partner and I have spoken about this and we are going to say from now on no one can smoke at our house - my dad also smokes).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnd the one that annoys me the most...\\n\\n* If DD is asleep when she arrives she'll poke and prod her saying something to the effect of \"common, wake up, I want cuddles\". This drives me mad. Especially at the moment when we aren't having many or long day time naps (sleeping like a champ at night though). Like seriously let her sleep! Why on earth wake her up?? She is the first grandchild so I get that she's excited and all those things but yeah still makes me go crazy on the inside.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: the formatting killed my soul   \n",
       "27                                                                                                                                                                                                                           So it's been awhile since I last wrote about my MIL. She's the one who is obsessed with Starbucks coffee and showed up late to get her hair and makeup for my wedding because she NEEDED her daily Starbucks. She also really likes leggings, ugg boots, and pumpkin spice so DH and I joke that's she an older version of a basic bitch. I call her Starbucks Bitch. \\n\\nSo things had been pretty quiet for several months. A few BEC moments, but I hadn't seen her since October so most of it wasn't that bad. She declared herself cancer free in December (her doctor declared her cancer free in like August but whatever), but as someone here told me, she now likes to insert cancer survivor as her excuse for everything. *Sigh* She sent me a novelty sweatshirt for Christmas because it was cheap - so even though DH told her before she bought it that I wouldn't wear it, she thought it would be rude of me not to wear it. It's since been donated. She also expressed her sympathy of a death in my family by telling DH to say sorry to me, and bragging to her daughters about how she sent flowers for the funeral. She didn't and she didn't think they would mention this to their brother. When I posted the obituary online she thanked me and said it was a shame they'd never get to meet. Not “sorry for your loss”. \\n\\nAnd then came the visit. Starbucks bitch and crew (FIL, SIL1, SIL2, and GC niece) all came for a visit last month. It was planned, and I dreaded it. DH and I talked about how to handle his mother - mainly that he would keep her away from me so I didn't have to deal with her crap. But he didn't really do a good job. The theme of this visit seemed to be that if PurpleCat said more than 3 sentences MIL and her entire family would die. Or at least that seems to be the game MIL was playing.  Someone asks me a direct question, Starbucks Bitch answers. One of these questions was literally about how my family is doing. She answered even though the last time she spoke to my mom was last year.  When I corrected her she giggled and told me that didn't sound right. Like how would you know???? \\n\\nShe also corrected everything I said. Here is a list of things I apparently got wrong:\\n\\n* There is no such thing as a home warranty. It's called insurance and you have to pay double the value of a new appliance for them to fix the old one.\\n* I got the alcohol laws of my state wrong. Walmart does sell hard liquor and liquor stores are open on Sundays. It was just a coincidence that the closest Walmart and liquor stores weren't open/didn't have liquor there. \\n* The school I work for doesn't teach kids past 8th grade. I thought we taught up to 12th grade since I have to work 12th grade graduation but I'm wrong. \\n* I forgot that I should always let MIL know I have my ID on me. It was really embarrassing for her when someone I asked if I could drive home and she told them I couldn't due to lack of my ID when I corrected her. Having to announce to your MIL that you are in possession of a driver's license any time she sees you is completely normal. \\n* I didn't want veggie stir fry at the restaurant. I was clearly confused and needed the menu read to me. \\n* I'm a vegetarian so I only eat tofu. If there isn't tofu I won't eat at that restaurant. Even if I say I will. Even if I suggested the restaurant.\\n* I'm not a vegetarian and I love chicken. \\n* I didn't specify how large the margaritas were at the restaurant, and by failing to do so I misled the entire family. I was also wrong to apologize for not specifying how big the margaritas were. MIL was not trying to shame me, but was only mentioning that she only approved this restaurant because I said they had margaritas. And if I told her the truth she wouldn't have picked that restaurant. \\n* I was wrong when I said I was in severe pain at the restaurant. So it was okay for her to order dessert and another glass of wine. (Later realized I had a stress related anxiety attack- never had one before but as soon as I was away from her everything was fine) \\n\\nThese are just the things she said and did in front of me. Behind my back she asked DH if I rushed him to buy a house (sidenote - we bought our first house!). She knows he wants to move closer to her (no he doesn't) so she knows I must have rushed him. When he said no we BOTH wanted to buy a house she told him he must be confused and explained how much harder it would be to move home now. Once I was gone his entire family also told him they would support him if they needed to tell me DH wasn’t comfortable buying a house - that felt GREAT. We aren't moving because we make good money here. I also can't stand the weather in his home state. I think she’s actually angry because us buying a house means she can’t pretend DH’s goal is to move back home, and because he never asked for her help/opinion about it. She brags to her friends and family that her children always consult her about big decisions so it was really embarrassing that DH didn’t ask mommy’s opinion before making this purchase. \\n\\nOn the last day DH finally confronted her when they were alone. He basically said the ball is in her court when it comes to our relationship. He told her she needed to stop treating me like a child who doesn't know anything. I noticed she did similar things to her daughters, especially SIL2, and DH tried to rug sweep (that's just how she is). After talking he realized while his sisters love his mom because she raised them and all, I have no reason to put up with her if she can't be normal. So he added that too. He mentioned that I'm a shy person, so just because I didn't publicly call her out on her shit doesn't mean I'm okay with her behavior. \\n\\nHer response? She laughed at him and told him I'm not shy. That was it. DH was pissed she accused him of not knowing his own wife. Cue the tears and shouting “That's not what I meant!\" and “It must just be my cancer brain!” But after all that the only thing she addresses is the comment about me being shy? Nothing about me not liking her or us having a less than ideal relationship? Apparently she treats me the way her own JustNoMIL treated her. And she brags how she's nothing like that woman and how close we are. \\n\\nAt this point I'm just done with her. I told DH I will continue to be civil, but we need to keep visits to a minimum. She can never stay overnight in our home, she will never be alone with any children we have (if she's comfortable telling me I'm wrong about my own job she's definitely okay with deciding I'm wrong with how I'll parent and do whatever she wants), and all contact between us will go through him (this won't be a problem when it comes to her talking to me since she already does this, but she expects me to post publicly for her special days so she can show off how much I love her). DH agreed but he still has a problem admitting I don't like her. He still thinks we can have a relationship even though I told him I don't really want one with her at this point, but she still needs to treat me with basic respect.\\n\\nWell I don't have to see her until Christmas now, so I expect silence until then. Maybe a few more BEC moments when she talks to DH on the phone, but I'm very glad I live several states away and only have to put with this woman 2 times a year, soon to be just once a year. :)   \n",

It was exactly what DH wanted and not to pat myself on the back, but I mopped the floor with the car salesmen. I used my finance background to my advantage and got a pretty good deal. I'm kind of proud of myself.. this whole situation has made me a hardass. \\n\\nDH's shiny spine has withered. He unblocked his parents numbers and has added them back on social media. I never removed them from mine, so I made a post about how DH and I are strong together and how the universe can't stop what it can't catch and included a picture of us from years ago.. his family didn't acknowledge the post, but I'm sure they've seen it. I got around 100 likes so since it was popular, probably went to the top of their newsfeed. FIL has messaged DH and me, texted, called, etc. He acts remorseful. He acknowledges me at work and has been asking about our new truck and wants to come over to see it. MIL still acts like she was entitled to the truck and they didn't do anything wrong. DH hasn't spoken to her very much. He did post about his new truck when he got it. She didn't like the post, but she sent him a text saying \"what, no pictures of your truck before you put it on Facebook?\" To which he replied \"No.\" Ha.\\n\\nI think I need to give DH a little grace.. I'm very disappointed and angry, but these aren't my parents. It's easy for me to cut them off because they didn't raise me. When you're raised by a narc, I guess it's hard to cut them off? I wouldn't know personally, but DH seems to be struggling A LOT with guilt. The guilt has been eating him alive and he seems angry at me for not letting them get away with it. I guess being angry at me is easier than being angry at MIL. He's having a hard time keeping an appetite and tries to justify what they did. But there's no way around it, they betrayed him. He acknowledges their messed up priorities and how she's just not a nice person and she cheated him out of his truck. I'm trying to remind him that his adverse feelings to what they did are normal and appropriate to the situation and not to fight it, just be with it. We've started therapy individually and together. It's still new and DH is having a hard time opening up, but I think he'll get there.\\n\\nAs for SIL's car, I have no real update. We've made about 5 months worth of \"ghost payments\" without telling FIL so we're ahead on the car payments. That way, if he misses one, it's not going to hurt us. No advice is wanted on this specifically, DH isn't going to take SIL's car, even though I know it's fair. I don't really want to take it now either.\\n\\nPregnancy is going well despite all this. We'll find out the gender in a couple weeks and I have a gut feeling it's a girl. I love being pregnant and I'm starting to feel little flutters here and there that could be baby kicks, but they could also be gas lol. This situation has opened DH's eyes enough to where he doesn't want LO around his parents with the exception of some holidays. They aren't trustworthy and he doesn't want to expose LO to their selfishness. Despite all that's happening, this is a very happy pregnancy. We're focusing on the good and counting our blessings.   \n",

reply [her reply was very apologetic and took responsibility for how she hurt me] and I said I would contact her when I was ready. She then told me \"okay in the meantime I will not contact you\"\\n\\nWell today I wake up to this email:\\n\\n\"Please let me know if your therapist thinks it would be beneficial to Skype me in!\\nLove you \\nMom\"\\n\\nIt's like no mom. Theres no resolution. I need space lol. \\n\\nWhat was she thinking?!?!?!?!\\n\\nIm contemplating just ignoring it or telling her my therapist thinks I need space and healing.   \n",

I have reread the rules to ensure I am doing my best to follow them, but if I have failed please kindly let me know and I will repost, edit, or whatever is necessary. I've tried my best to find a flair that I think fits, but if there is something else I haven't seen because I have the eyes of a mole I will change it.\\n\\nStraight to the point, GlassCow, my MIL, passed away many months ago. It was not appropriate at the time to post about it. In fact, I don't think it even occurred to me as I haven't been on Reddit in a long, long while. My DW had a hard time for a while, but things have gotten better. A lot better, actually. \\n\\nAs to how she died, that's what the trigger warning's for. If you don't want to know skip this next paragraph.\\n\\nNow, if you travel along BitchBot's link journey or are familiar with my MIL, you will recall that she was a hoarder. Not of garbage or useless tat (in the general and assorted sense, anyway) but in glass figurines and items stacked in box after box until her home looked like a carpeted warehouse with cardboard walls. After we cut her out of our lives, the hoarding got worse. Windows and doors, the few important ones left unhindered were beginning to be filled. Another window didn't go, luckily, but they were covered nonetheless. Boxes were even shoved on top of her stove when she was found, a place she'd avoided before. Then there came a day when the boxes fell inward, but sadly not on top of her. I say sadly not because I wanted her to die, but because they blocked the remaining door instead. And she died, trapped in her house, with no longer quick access to her phone, any exits, or anyone left who would want to check on her out of love or worry, of starvation. This isn't how any of us wanted things to happen. It's not how things should have gone at all. In a long winding journey, it was debated as to whether or not DW, my BIL (her brother), and SIL (his wife) should be charged with elder neglect, but this was ultimately dropped one by one starting with my wife and ending with her brother. It was decided that she had given evidence of not being senile, had been offered the help obligated, and it was of her own volition that the hoard grew to that dangerous point. Even then, sometimes I feel maybe the police or a social worker should have gotten more involved, but they've both been contacted multiple times. \\n\\nNow, on a lighter note, some BEC from my mother.\\n\\nAs you might also recall or read in my history, my mother's a little donate happy but with *our* things. So now when she gives us gifts, we have a special box we put it in to donate since it's such a big deal. \\n\\nThank you so much for reading this, and I hope you read something happier today.\\n\\nTLDR; My MIL has died and my mother's gifts now get donated since she nags about us donating.   \n",

We are hosting dinner tonight at 5pm. My MIL has been asking for months to come early to \"help\". Unfortunately, her idea of helping is... the opposite of helpful. She has tried various ways to sneak into coming early, so I texted her yesterday \"See you tomorrow at 5\". She tried one more time to ask if I needed her there earlier to help and I said that we would not be home earlier.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhat do I  tell her when she shows up at my door early? I have severe social anxiety and I have to deal with her for three days, so it needs to be firm but super polite.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI was thinking of saying \"Nice to see you. I'm heading out right now, see you at 5\" but that forces me to run out the door when she shows up and I may have stuff in the oven.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nDo all y'all have any suggestions?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\\*\\*\\* UPDATE \\*\\*\\*\\n\\nYOU GUYS ROCK\\n\\nI sent her a polite reminder email, \"Can't wait to see you at 5\" and then turned up the music and locked the front door. :-) She tried one more time over text and I politely shot her down again.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI have to run to the store and then I am getting into the shower... so there is no way she can show up early now.  :-)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI'm going to use some of your other advice for tomorrow, too. I need her not to show up until the BBQ so I am going to use my BIL to do a combination of wrangling her and sending her off on a wild goose chase. I'm sure I can think of a list of things that I will conveniently remember I need \\*just\\* as she almost gets here. Lol.   \n",

   I posted this to legal advice and they removed it pretty much immediately. For the last several months my mother has been progressively more unhinged, and picks fights constantly. She and I have never gotten along. Last month my boyfriend and I had a fight and he moved out, causing me to be unable to pay this months rent. All month she’s been more and more verbally abusive and angry over that, and tells me to get out every single day. We have nowhere else to go, so I told her that when she filed an eviction notice we would leave. She thought that was out of spite, when it is truly out of necessity. \\n\\nLast night she picked a fight specifically to cause a reaction in me, and when I didn’t bite, she left the house. 20 minutes later, the cops showed up and said that apparently I had thrown juice at her (she grabbed my hand while I was holding it) and that I stole her phone. None of that happened, which I told the police, and the cops left. Today I spent watching the kids and cleaning/cooking. She left around 11 am. \\n\\nAround 4:30 there was a knock on the door. It was a sheriff there to serve me with a Civil Protection Order. She wanted me out, so she told a number of lies (I have a copy of what she said) alleging my “abuse” towards her. Including that I stole her phone and deleted “incriminating recordings” and “constant verbal abuse” and that I “throw things” and “impeded her egress from room to room.” \\n\\nOnly one of the things she said was actually true, and it was the culmination of a time she and I had a really long argument and I was begging her to please just listen to me. I was sobbing and I stood in front of her and she couldn’t get around me. I’m much larger than her. I expect she thinks that will go in her favor. \\n\\nAnyway, I’m currently homeless with my two kids, and I can’t find anything online pertaining to what I can do in this situation. All the info has to do with the person who filed the order. I can’t afford a lawyer, and since this is a civil case I don’t qualify for a public defender. This is wholly and completely false, and I’m terrified. I’m in Ohio. Please please help.   \n",

All told, we lost both our fathers to cancer (his after a 2+ year battle, mine after ~9 months), we bought a house, got a cat and a puppy, got married, faced mental health diagnoses and debilitating back injuries, you name it.\\n\\nWhen we first got together I adored my MIL- she seemed like my biggest advocate and had a huge heart. She would stand up for me when she knew we were having problems, told me she’d love me even if I didn’t stay with him, etc.\\n\\nHowever.\\n\\nMore recently I’ve begun to see her behavior as super problematic and begun to realize the ways in which she has gaslit me into not noticing until now (even though my friends noticed way before I did).\\n\\nOn the mild end of the spectrum, MIL “pops by” to our house, often a few times a week. She makes everything about her (when a cousin had a baby in her birthday month, she said it was her bday present; FB comments congratulating us on our new puppy are about how she got to hold him, etc.). She pays for everything all the time so she can get exactly what she wants but no one can get mad at her for controlling everything because of her “generosity”. Just annoying stuff.\\n\\nThe more recent and awful bullshit is that she got engaged and told my husband via text message. Text. A group text, at that. I didn’t even get to find out from her, I had to find out from him after he was devastated and hurt by the news. \\n\\nContext: husband and I were contributing to HOA fees for a vacation property that was supposed to be for “the family” but all of Husbands ideas were immediately shot down even though he gave her hundreds of dollars and hours of his time and effort fixing up the property. He does a lot for her, cleaning her gutters and doing work on her home that she is rarely grateful for. Also, the guy she is marrying is all sorts of problematic (gives me a real “Dirty John”-minus-the-murder vibe if you’re familiar with the podcast), but that’s not relevant to this story. Husband has told her his issues with the guy and her response is always, “How long do you expect me to be miserable and alone?!” (With lots of tears, I must add).\\n\\nSo, she gets engaged and doesn’t bother to do a signature “pop in” to at least tell us in person, or at the very least call us. We also had to find out from family that she bought a $300k vacation house (she does not have the money to support multiple homes) at the request of this new fiancé. Engagement and home purchase occurred within ~2 days of each other.\\n\\nWe initiated NC after she was blowing up our phones, trying to use me to find husband. Husband sent her a text reading, simply, “we don’t want to talk to you. Leave us alone”. He also told her that we are no longer interested in being a part of their vacation property and that we needed space.\\n\\nShe couldn’t respect that and continuously called him and kept popping by our house unannounced. The last time she did it (the Friday before Mother’s Day), I inserted myself into the conversation (usually I stay out of it) because I’m just fucking done.\\n\\nShe went on and on about how we hurt her by not congratulating her on her engagement, how it wasn’t fair for us to be mad about the house because she was thinking of us when she bought it, how she was upset that I didn’t contact her after Husband asked for space. I tried explaining boundaries to her and telling her how her actions were hurtful. It seemed positive at the time and like we made a good step forward but here’s the problem:\\n\\nShe won’t stop talking about having us out to the property to visit and stay. She wants us to come with our dog multiple weekends a month, and she’s stated that “when we have kids”, she’ll watch them at the property so we can have “breaks”.\\n\\nWe have no interest in the property and Husband and I have already privately agreed that IF we have kids, we will not let her take them for extended stays on the property (which is on an island only accessible by private ferry and has no medical/fire/police services in case of an emergency).\\n\\nShe clearly wants everything to go back to the way it was, but it can’t. She doesn’t respect our personal space. No one is allowed to criticize her or her choices but she is quick to criticize my Husband and to tell me that I “act like my mother sometimes”, which she well knows is deeply insulting given my life context. She is not content with us accepting her choices even if we disagree with them, she insists that we have to be happy about them.\\n\\nHow on earth do I (and Husband) navigate this space? Husband is lost, since he has always gone above and beyond to take care of everyone in his family. I want to protect him (and myself!) but I don’t know how to do that without her deciding I’m a bitch and the enemy and turning this into a bigger issue with the family.   \n",

The only sin of MIL was trying to “talk” to our 8 month old DD on speakerphone. Seeing her look back at me like that confused pug gif was a present in itself.\\n\\nWell. This Sunday. It appears MIL wants to do a belated Mother’s Day brunch (gag). \\n\\nNeed some advice on re-establishing boundaries. She will 100% offer to babysit one day. Lol. Nope. \\n\\nDH still needs to build a shiny spine, but I’m seeing some vertebrae. \\n\\nHow do I grey-rock through this damn thing?\\n\\nAnd in case you were curious, to date, ZERO apologies for her crimes during my pregnancy. Would we expect anything less?   \n",

and sought advice from during my son’s medical treatment after he was born has been sharing every detail (and photos) with my mother after I asked her not to. \\n\\nI have been no contact for a number of years but never discussed it with most of my family and friends.  After being betrayed by someone I thought I could trust, I decided I’m tired of basically covering for her bullshit by staying silent. \\n\\n“I really am not one to air family issues semi-publicly, unfortunately I feel the need to today. This message is only viewable by my family or friends who may have contact with my mother. \\n\\nI do not wish for her to have any information about my life or photos of my child. I have already limited contact with those I feel can’t respect this. \\n\\nI shouldn’t have to justify it, but I will because I care about my family a lot and it occurred to me that people just might not know. \\n\\nThe short version is this: I cut contact with her in May 2015. She continues to be toxic and manipulative to get what she wants and make people feel sorry for her. She made terrible choices with lasting consequences when I was a child and takes no responsibility. She cannot be trusted with children which is why she cannot have contact with my son. \\n\\nOn the day my baby was born she broke into my house and went through my mail to find out what hospital we were at. She then refused to leave the hospital lobby while I had an unplanned c-section and He had to be transferred for serious complications. We had to plan to take him out another door to transport because she refused to leave. \\n\\nI don’t think anything more needs to be said. I am not asking you to choose. She is charming and has been close with some of you, especially my cousins. I am okay if you want to avoid the drama and just unfriend me on Facebook. I will not hold it against you and I will be happy to see you and catch up at family functions. \\n\\nI hope you understand. Thank you for reading.”\\n\\nI really hope she doesn’t continue to escalate this but now she has a serious flying monkey, there’s no telling. At least now she can’t spread her lies unchallenged.   \n",

My MIL, although imperfect, is a kind woman with good boundaries.  My Dad's wife, however, is a source of frustration and sadness for me.\\n\\nShe is the complete opposite of my mother, who was a classy, intelligent, progressive, financially responsible woman who died 10 years ago.  She maniulated my Dad into cutting my sister and I out of his will (a story for another time - we've come to terms with it), and for a short while tried to keep him from seeing or talking to me.  After I publicly called her out over a racist post on the Book of Faces, and she unfriended me, we came to an unspoken agreement to avoid any topic we disagree about and keep our infrequent interactions polite and surface-level.  I feel like the relationship we have now is at its maximum potential.  \\n\\nShe and my Dad came to see me around Mother's Day, which coincides with my birthday, to take me to dinner and drop off their gifts for my upcoming baby shower, since she'll likely miss it due to a serious family matter.  At one point, she brought up my registry, and said that while they were shopping for the shower gifts, she noticed I'd included a breast pump.  She said that when she saw that, she couldn't help but exclaim to my Dad that \"this baby's going to starve!\" because I'm so tiny.\\n\\nI was taken aback because although I've been told that people will shame you regardless of how you feed your baby, I've heard and read so many positive things about breastfeeding that I assumed it would be more likely that I'd get shamed for formula feeding.  I have prepared responses for a lot of the expected unsolicited advice and belly touching, but wasn't ready for this.  So, I just said \"well, if I'm not producing enough, I plan to supplement with formula,\" which I do intend to do if I'm struggling for whatever reason and lactation consultants can't help.  There are formula-related items on my registry as well.  She acted relieved to hear that and dropped the subject.\\n\\nIt's still bothering me weeks later, partly because it was ignorant - a woman's size doesn't affect milk production, and partly because it was invasive and inappropriate - how my husband and I feed our child is nobody's business but our own and that of our health care team, unless we explicitly ask for input.  I wish I had responded differently, in a way that didn't seem to validate her concerns.  On top of this, my normally JY Dad's response when I expressed how difficult pregnancy has been was to awkwardly laugh and say \"well, you got yourself into this.\"  Ugh, cringe.  I'm hoping writing about this visit helps purge the negativity.   \n",

                                                History:when I divorced my ex he got custody of our children. He was abusive to me and controlling.I had never been anything other than a sahm. After The divorce I went to school got a degree.I’m remarrying this coming winter to a great man.Everyone knows we want a baby.GM tells me I don’t deserve a child,I gave mine up!crying. Just hurtful. What I’m supposed to say to the woman who raised me when she says things like this?!? I fought tooth and nail for my kids. FH is so wonderful he’s never been married or had children. Why is it so wrong to want this? My kids are in another state rarely get to so much as call me. And she knows how this hurts me.  My BFF thinks I should just cut ties then I’m worried she would pass away and I’d never know it. It’s toxic. I’m not garbage it’s not like my kids were taken away. I worked hard to get a degree in design so I didn’t need someone to support me. I’m finally trying to have a life after everything I went through with my ex. She always says things like this and thinks it’s ok. Idk what to do anymore I just want to be happy.   \n",

This is an old story from when I was a kid, and just sort of illustrates her personality. Edit: advice is welcome, but it’s an old story. :)\\n\\n\\nMy mother has a knack for making me feel personally responsible for her feelings. This was especially true when it came to my clothes. I’m an only child, and was essentially a doll for her when I was young. To be fair, I was a very cute kid. \\n\\nThings started going south when I turned 11/12, as they will for pre-teens. The week before the start of middle school, we went shopping for school clothes. If my mom picked something out and I didn’t like it, her response would be to take it as a personal attack on her taste, generosity, and general mothering. I was often called ungrateful and spoiled. (Side note: if I’m spoiled, and you’re my parent.... whose fault is it?) \\n\\nSo we’re in JC Penney or some other department store where I never could find things I liked, and she picks out the UGLIEST sweater I’ve ever seen. It’s chenille, but that cheap plastic-y stretchy chenille that was popular in the late 90s/00s, and it was green. Now I like green, I’m wearing a green dress right now, but this is a neon-pea electric-vomit colored mess. I hated it, and begged her not to buy it, but she was adamant that I needed a sweater and THIS monstrosity was the one I’d be wearing. I would wear it, or she would return the rest of the clothes we had just spent the last torturous hours fighting over and she’d pick out ALL of my clothes for school. Of course, I folded, and off we went, ugly sweater in hand. \\n\\nDo you think she EVER forgot to make me wear it? Of course not, she made me wear it ALL the goddamn time, including for my birthday that year. The sweater was too short, too boxy, wickedly uncomfortable, and ugly as sin, just what you want to wear as you begin puberty. \\n\\nAt some point that next summer I managed to “accidentally” rip the sleeve, and my not-crafty-at-all mother actually attempted to fix it before I pointed out that it didn’t fit (never fit) and certainly wouldn’t fit by next winter. \\n\\nShe keeps the photo of me on my birthday in that damn sweater on the wall in her kitchen so I see it every time I’m there. I think she likes to remind me of how terrible she could make me look. Someday I’m going to find a perfect match and gift it to her for a holiday, just to be petty.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Guess who's 39 weeks + 2 days pregnant....I am. Currently I show no signs of going into labor and my OBGYN isn't gonna induce me unless I get to 41 weeks or over without going into labor naturally. (I am miserable and also nesting super hard right now.)\\n\\nSo we're having a baby girl and I'll be honest picking out names has been super rough because we didn't find out I was pregnant until like 30 weeks because of medical issues masking my symptoms. Neither I or my SO have important female role models in our lives that we could name our daughter after. We've managed to kinda make a list of names that we've narrowed down over time, and we excitedly talked about said names in front of FMIL once or twice. \\n\\nOne of those names which is like the #1 choice in my opinion just so happens to be the name of someone's child who FMIL is really good friends with. I've never met this best friend because she happens to reside in California and we're all the way over here in Ohio. So it's not like I knew she had a child with that name or that I'll ever even meet that child.\\n\\nFMIL decided to tell this friend that we considered this name for our daughter and this women had the nerve to say we can't use that name, and that we need to find our \"own\" name. (As if any name these days is exactly original unless you literally create it yourself somehow. Also the name we like is literally the name of a few female celebrities. So it's not like it's uncommon or super unique.)\\n\\nAnyway. FMIL brought up what this friend said to us just recently and this isn't the only time she's told us we can't use that name because this other child is named that. Also she won't stop saying we should use another name I had brought up as an option like once. Unfortunately I absolutely hate that name now because of how much she seems to like it and because of how often she brings it up.\\n\\nAll of this has put a damper on my excitement to meet my daughter soon because now I'm second guessing my name choice, and I don't have a lot of time left to figure out another name SO and I both are enthusiastic about. I was already kinda referring to my daughter as said name in my head and I even mentioned the name to my OBGYN who thought it was very lovely.\\n\\nI'll be honest when FMIL brought up what this friend said to us I kinda snapped back with \"well I don't know this woman or her daughter so...\". The farther along I get the less I can deal with her bullshit and the harder it gets to hold my damn tongue.   \n",

Aunt-in-law is showing some positive progress. They think they can hold off on surgery and she can possibly make her flight back to our home state on Sunday. Instadopt is on her way to a luau. Also, apparently they had an earthquake in Hawaii today. It has certainly been a trip for the books. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo my MIL Instadopt has actually been on very good behavior since my father died. I would actually label her a JustYes the last few months. I think she truly understands the magnitude of losses I have experienced and can actually see some things through my eyes.\\n\\nInstadopt's Sister my Aunt-in-law, has a milestone birthday. Aunt-in-law has been a JustNo for the last few years. To summarize things, she had uncontrolled diabetes that she refused to work on, take medication for, or heed any medical warnings for. Aunt-in-law got a blood clot in her leg at 44 yo. This was tragic. She went to have an angioplasty done on her leg. The surgeon forgot to give her blood thinners and she ended up losing the leg at 44 years old after numerous surgeries. These surgeries elevated her blood sugar and her eyesight went also (she is legally blind in both eyes now). Since then her kidneys have given out and she is on dialysis due to stage 4 kidney failure.\\n\\nI have tons of empathy for Aunt-in-law. It seemed like a horrible array of tragedies to happen to one person. However, throughout the entire process, she has been completely noncompliant in terms of eating foods she is not supposed to, refusal to take medication, refusal to attend support groups, and refusal to seek counseling or a psychiatrist for her now major depression. She managed to get her GP to proscribe her an antidepressant (she self-diagnosed and told them what she wanted to take) and has also gotten hooked on painkillers throughout this process. She was a psychology undergrad and therefore she feels she doesn't need to see a psychiatrist and can self-medicate.\\n\\nInstadopt has been by her side this whole time- at every hospitalization, doctor's appointment, taking time off of work, spending a few hours once a week at her place, calling every day, taking her in to help her recuperate from a few major surgeries. Aunt-in-law has been very selfish throughout, expecting Instadopt to drop everything and wait on her hand and foot. (This has also fed into my decision to delay kids because Instadopt wants to help with babysitting full time and there is no way she could do such a thing if Aunt-in-law needs her at any point).\\n\\nAnyway, Aunt-in-law hit a milestone birthday and Instadopt asks her what she wants to do. Aunt-in-law wants to go to Hawaii. To be fair, Instadopt has wanted to go to Hawaii for some time, but given Aunt-in-law's health issues, the distance, etc, it didn't seem wise. However Instadopt is willing to do anything for Aunt-in-law. So the trip gets booked with ravel insurance in case of Aunt-in-law's illness flaring up.\\n\\nA week ago, one of Aunt-in-law's toes on her good leg turns black. Then she gets a boil in her groin. Not long after that her doctor notices gangrene on her finger of her dialysis arm. Instadopt's DH says maybe they shouldn't go and cash in travel insurance. Instadopt tries to convince Aunt-in-law to go back to her GP or hospital to have it checked out before flight. Aunt-in-law insists a course of oral antibiotics will clear it all up. They get on a plane to Hawaii last weekend (Saturday). They arrive. Sunday morning, Aunt-in-law is rushed to the ER in Hawaii. She has been in the hospital now since Sunday and the Dr's in Hawaii says it has progressed to Cellulitis and now it may mean a toe amputation too, in addition to a strong course of IV antibiotics and surgery on the cellulitis.\\n\\nInstadopt is telling the Dr. she has to be on a plane to our home state (9 hour ride) by Sunday. Dr. isn't sure. Now Instadopt is calling travel insurance to see if they will reimburse if flights have to be changed. Instadopt planned to return to work Tuesday. That's not looking good. In any event when they do get back to our home state she will have to be immediately admitted to the hospital here. The last time this happened she was in the hospital and rehab facility for months. She has a birthday brunch planned for 2 weeks after her return.   \n",

My bad. \\n\\nI feel like JNMIL and Just no any family member are fools bc they want unlimited access to their grand baby’s but the grand baby will know how they are and will always pick the mommy. \\n\\nIn my case my mother had an abusive JNMIL my JNGM who I have seen 2xs in 20 years bc I can’t stand her. I know she was horrible to my mom and she was kind of a bitch to me as a kid so once I was old enough to tell her off I did. I am 35 have seen her 2 xs since I was 15. I told her off and have zero interest in her, she pretends not to be horrid but she is. We all know she is. But I’m an adult so I don’t have to see her. My daughter will never know her. For her safety and well being, NEVER won’t even know about her.\\n\\nMy mom re married and her knew MIl and in-laws suck. Are they abusive no, they are just BEC and mean girl nonsense. Her husband is great, my stepfather  an amazing human and excellent father, His siblings and their wives Just awful. So once again all of her kids (me and 3 brothers) know how they treat my mom so we don’t care for them much. Are we polite? Mostly, (I’m an adult now so sometimes I will drop a snarky comment on them like ¨ I know I don’t see you that often but I wonder why grandma tells everyone you have developmental issues, you seem perfectly fine to me” ) Do we go out of our way for them hell no.  Do we see them that much NOPE. Not even for holidays.\\n\\nSo what is the end game for my in-laws? To win my daughter over from me? That will never happen. Even though I never bad mouth them. (Just like my mom never bad mouthed hers) she will pick up my dislike of them. What do they think will happen by systematically ignoring my wishes that I will accommodate them? They are delusional. I will see them less and less which they know because I have been seeing them less and less.  You don’t want to listen fine then I don’t have to you. \\n\\nSo we are out running errands and my husband is like can we stop by to see my brother for whatever reason. I was like ok it’s just him and only for a few min. Now his mom came over last night for her weekly visit bc they were going to Athens and won’t see baby for awhile so imagine my surprise when she came outside to see The baby.  Apparently they are leaving tonight so why the rush to see the baby yesterday? Our MGG manipulation. Another weird thing FIL drove MGG over to see the baby but didn’t come inside himself.  🤷🏻‍♀️\\n\\nPretty sure this sneaky move is more on my husband triggered by MGG who has been working on him. Cause he keep asking. I told him as long as he supervises her she can visit but I won’t be their. He is like but I work. Tough cookie then, Cause as I explained she my want to see The Baby But I NEED to be respected and listened to first. \\n\\nMGG says all sorts of moronic stuff to him to manipulate him. 40 years of his moms mind fuckery is hard to break all at once. “We’re gonna die soon you have to stay in Greece forever” both of them are healthy old but healthy. This got a laugh from me when he said that to me. Cause logically it’s a fail. \\n\\nAnyways so she is their and I am like huh really. Hubby wants to do a BBQ on Sunday but they already had their visit so nope. 🤷🏻‍♀️\\n\\nSo MGG  is shrinking nonsense in whatever language at the baby and BIL is holding her whispering to her in Greek and the baby looks appalled. \\n\\nHubby is sitting next to me and I text him English so he says “could you both please speak to her in English”I follow it up with “please speak calmer to her, you can still use a nice voice but she gets agitated if you talk excitedly to her, also please use proper words it’s better for a child’s mental development” cause whatever MIL was saying to her wasn’t a word in any language. \\n\\n\\nMIL gave me a look like yeah no and BIL was like “I’m speaking Greek. She needs to learn Greek.” \\n\\nI pushed back “no she doesn’t she will learn it in school we are focusing on English with her¨ (over my dead body will she go to school in Greece. you think American schools are bad Greece is like I can top that) he pushed back again and  flat out said well “I no longer care him she learns Greek or not.” \\n\\nHusband  interjects “Speak English my wife wants to be included I will take care of teaching baby Greek” \\n\\nBIL “it’s not like I was telling her secrets” me “ regardless they are in fact secrets from me” \\n\\nWhole time MGG complaining in Greek to my husband so yes they are in fact telling secrets. \\n\\nWhen I mean speak English I mean do not speak Greek at all, to anyone in my presence. What they have done for years is would speak English to me but Greek to each other which is so fucking rude.  Honestly I am shocked they think this is ok. No they know it’s bad but I haven’t given a fuck before bc we would see them 3 weeks a year. So 🤷🏻‍♀️. Then we moved to Greece for my husbands work. They still did it but I did not care because I am not close with them and did not care enough to correct that behavior. \\n\\nNow I have a baby MIL proved she couldn’t be trusted by saying shitty things about hubby and me to The baby in Greek. Now I fucking care. \\n\\nAlso MGG then grabbed the baby from BIL and started walking awkwardly with her. Of course the baby started screaming. You have to hold her securely. I am glad my baby is old enough now to express her displeasure. \\n\\nThe hubby instantly took the baby away from MGG. On the way home he was like I wonder why that happened. - dose he really? Cause I can provide the answers. I told him and he was like no that can’t be it. 🤷🏻‍♀️  \\n\\n\\nThe hubby keeps pressuring me to let his mom come over and see the baby more. We are going to have a sit down about it tomorrow and I am trying to figure out what to say. Cause it’s not going to happen. \\n\\nI can not spend more time with that women the shrieking and disrespect I can’t. \\n\\nThe funny thing is HE doesn’t even want to. \\n\\nShe was over last night in which I went upstairs for some peace and quite. Leaving him to supervise and interact with her. He lasted 20 min. Why would he make me suffer her if he can’t even last 20 min with her. \\n\\nHe keeps saying your parents did and refuses to see the difference between them.  \\n\\nIt is  not logical at this point. \\n\\nHow do I address this so he understand?\\n\\nI point out the unsafe behaviors she has done and he is like ok I have addressed them.\\n\\nI am like but what about the next unsafe thing she does? She has proven her untrustworthiness and inability to respect even the most basic current safe parenting standards. \\n\\nAnd he says I am irrational one because I am blaming her for something she hasn’t done yet. \\n\\nI am like no I am holding her accountable for past behavior and protecting OUR child according. \\n\\n🤷🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🙄\\n\\n\\nEdit so I got 2 post on here from a Greek troll ranting about I was at fault and Greek is a beautiful language.... both accounts new... do you think it’s my in-laws stalking me because that would be so disturbing.   \n",

Today is a good day! Maybe it’s the start of a new adventure of telling my MIL back the F off! But I know it’s going to be an adjustment for my DH. Here’s the story. \\n\\nSo my phone has been dead for about two hours. Couldn’t find the charger. When I finally found it and got my phone back on, the fun began. 15 freaking text messages from my MIL in a group text with my DH came flooding in. Apparently, she decided to take her vacation during my children’s 7th birthday in about a month and a half away. Not a big deal right. Well there’s more to it. She’s not just taking her vacation the week of my children’s birthday (we already made plans) but signed my DH and I up with our kids, to go 3 STATES AWAY, out of town, to my (The Queen bee of the fly monkeys) SIL’s. She said she already told my SIL we were coming. They already told her children too. So now they are all excited to see their cousins on their birthday and 4th of July week. So now they are in the process of planning my children’s Bday party (a day before 4th of July), 3 states away,  and a 4th of July party/ graduation party for her child competing kindergarten. Apparently she had already spent lots of money on the party and reserved a party clown and bouncy house too. \\n\\nSo according to my MIL (even tho she NEVER asked us if we could go) we are going. My DH works during the week so she told him to take off work, telling his boss a out right lie, that someone died in the family. So, he has to go to a funeral out of town to be their for his mother who just lost her husband too (it will be a year ago, in a week). If that doesn’t work, then just my children and I can go. See, I don’t work. So I have no obligations to stay home. I can always come. Then she text us, what the plans are. She will be picking us up the week of my boys bday, Monday at 7am in the Morning to drive 10 hours down to my SIL’s for 5 days. \\n\\nThe fucking balls of this woman!!!!!! On top of never asking us if we can go and the fact that she knows I HATE My SIL. She ignores all the damn plans we have already made with my friend and her kids, for my children’s bday. We have not even set a day in stone for the bday bc it’s still 7 weeks away. But we did tell their one cousin, who lives 10 minutes away, my friend, and two other children what we are doing. They all confirmed they can come. We are going to have a cook out, cake, and a day at the beach (only 10 minute walk away from my house). Then come home, have a fire and camp out in a tent, in the back yard for the kids FIRST sleep over party. Nothing crazy but that’s why we haven’t set a day yet. Bc we need to plan it around the 10 day weather forecast. But everyone is expecting it to happen around their bday week. \\n\\nMy MIL KNEW alllll about this already. I told her 2 weeks ago when she asked what our plans are for my kids bday. But nope. She don’t care. We do what she wants. End of story. WRONG! I was going to flip the F out until my DH FINALLY grew a pair and stepped in. He told her the following:\\n\\n“Speechless mom. I really don’t know what to say. Except I’m sorry. We will not be joining you. You should of talked to me first.  Its a nice thought but no. Would be nice to see my sister and my nieces but not at the expense of my children’s already planned birthday party. My job mom! It’s a career! I don’t take that shit Lightly. You know how hard I worked to get were I am. If you wanted to plan a family trip, you got to TALK with me and my wife FIRST! You don’t make plans for us, 10 fucking hours away. You know I do side work too. What if I had gigs planned already. I can’t cancel. That’s my professional reputation mom and telling me to LIE about a family members death is just messed up. How do you even know, we would even have the ability to miss a whole entire weeks worth of pay!? The boys will be in soccer and science camp this summer too. Remember I told you. You know how much it costs. I got twins mom. Two summer camps on one income. They will not miss one fucking day! You knew it’s the first year they’ve ever done a camp or a sport and it’s the new neighborhood. I want the kids to make friends this summer. I want them to have a good next year in their new school. YOU will have to break the news to my nieces we will not be coming. YOU will have to fix the mess you made with my sister and any money she spent on the party she is planning. I don’t care. She ripped me off anyways when she cried the blues she had no utilities so I gave her 700 dollars she never paid back. Yea but she’s broke planning 3 parties. Whatever. I have nothing to do with this shit. \\n\\nI love you mom. You know I do. I have tried my best to keep things under control with you since your weird controlling behavior started. I’ve been trying to juggle my wife’s feelings and yours. I’ve been trying to see both sides. I do but this is wrong. It’s your way or nothing. I’m not sure why you are acting this way but it’s not ok. All your going to do is push me away. Remember I’m the only one out of all of your kids who still lives under 2 hours away from you. Everyone else is a day drive or flying distance. And If you bring dads death up as an excuse...... don’t even try it.” \\n\\nHe texted her all of this in a group text. WOW!!!! I was stunned and sooooooooooo freaking happy. She responded with, “A short no would of been fine and in private. I see what’s going on. We will talk more about this when we have some privacy. Did you forget we are in a group text? I’m very hurt. I’m very very disappointed in you. Remember you are the man of the family now that your father is gone. He asked one thing of you before he died and that was to take care of me and look out for your sisters. What would he think now😞 I understand you don’t have to come on the trip. But think about what I said bc you really hurt me son.”\\n\\nHe didn’t respond to her But he did text me.\\n\\n“There..... are you happy!? I choose you and not her. I did what u wanted. Now I feel like shit. But at least we aren’t going on the trip.”   \n",

a story of my MIL and wedding planning. Feel free to add your own to this.\\n\\nI just don't understand people and the trying to invite/throw parties and their excuse is \"But they will get you gifts!\"\\n\\nI ended up not having a Bridal Shower because my MIL wanted to throw me one (my mom lives far away) and MIL didn't even ask if my MOH was throwing one for me instead. She just simply assumed she would throw me one and invite all of her society friends that I had never met before to it. No asking me, no discussing a guest list, NOTHING! So I shut it down and said no thank you. Out comes the \"But you will get lots of presents!\" \"I do not feel right having a party with a bunch of people I don't know just so I can get stuff\". Evidently this was completely foreign to her because this is what all of her society friends did and now it was her turn to cash in. I was just floored. \\n\\nSo needless to say, I did not get a Bridal Shower because I refused to let MIL throw one for all her little friends (and in a JustNoSO moment, DH refused to let me have one from someone else as it would hurt his mommy's fee fees *eye roll* )   \n",

                    When husband and I got married we were poor. We had lived together for three years. We didn't really need house stuff. So we decided not to register for gifts and just ask for cash/gift cards.\\n\\nWELL. MIL found out about this and told husband that is TACKY. She can't go to her relatives and tell them we want cash! We have to have a registry. \\n\\nOk fine. I created a registry at Macy's and Target. And I registered for so much random shit you guys. I can't remember all of it but it did include these items: a garden hose, a lawn gnome, power tools, window blinds, and an ice cream maker. Most of our friends knew we wanted cash and gave us money gifts. I did get the ice cream maker. Husband got power tools. We did not get the gnome 😪. \\n\\nHonestly, the registries for both places were obnoxiously long. \\n\\nSo if your MIL is trying to fuck with your registry, troll her with your registry. Good luck!   \n",

He has her number blocked and wants me to do the same. He is incredibly emotional about this and sees me refusing to block her number as me “being in contact with someone who kept me captive” (his exact words - I do not speak to her at all). \\n\\nI do not want to block her number because I want to be able to document any contact she tries to have with me. She very much blames me for BF going NC - I actually encouraged him to reach out to her on Christmas and he refused so she is wrong. So I am afraid that her anger will be directed at me if we experience an extinction burst. \\n\\nAnother reason I don’t want to block her is so that we have a heads up if an extinction burst is coming. BF had 10+ voicemails (in a blocked folder) from her yesterday but I have nothing. If she is really serious about losing her mind I think I will at least get a text and then we will know something is up. \\n\\nBF is very emotional about this and I feel bad that I am making it worse, but I am also affected by her crazy and I feel like I have a right to do what I want to do in terms of my phone. He is so blinded by his rage towards her that he doesn’t get that I am scared too, and this is how I prefer to deal with it. AITA?\\n\\nEDIT: thank you all for your responses - most were super helpful/gentle and I appreciate that. Just want to clear some things up: 1. I did block her number and BF agreed to split the cost of security cameras with me. 2. If I had not blocked her, if she were to text me I would not respond. We are not in contact whatsoever. 3. Maybe “encouraged” was the wrong word. I loathe MIL and wish BF would’ve cut contact years ago but tried not to push my opinion on him because I didn’t want to drive a wedge anywhere that wasn’t my business. He expressed his guilt about not planning to speak with MIL and I offered to change my plans to go with him so he didn’t have to go alone. It upsets me that anyone would think I pushed him towards his abuser because I don’t feel that was the case. We have both been abused by MIL and we are trying to navigate this together. I would appreciate it if the comments didn’t focus on my (admittedly wrong) actions around the holidays. Thank you.   \n",

It’s been a rough couple of days, but I’m still here. I don’t know if I said this already, but I made it to the interview, and I got an offer for the job yesterday. I panicked, I wasn’t sure if I should take it or not (They offered me less money than I thought I’d be working for, and I’m a little worried my hours might have gotten mixed up, but I can always ask about that) but I think I’m going to.\\n\\nBut I’m really worried over what I’m gonna tell my mom and dad. Mom’s going to prod and ask a million questions, and then she’ll use Dad to tell me what I can and can’t do because she knows we don’t dare argue with him. I’m at a point right now where I just want to say “I’m going to work” and stay silent when she does the whole interrogation, or just respond to everything with, “You don’t like it when I talk about jobs.”\\n\\nWhat I’m even more worried about is that they might refuse to let me use the car. I don’t know if that counts as refusing to let someone leave the house, so I don’t know what I’m going to do if that happens. (But that’s another reason I really should take this job, so I can at least start saving up for my own car.)\\n\\nDoes anyone have any advice as to what I should do if they ask? And what if they do refuse to let me use the car? If they find out I took the job behind their backs after they told me I shouldn’t, they’ll be furious. (And while we’re at it, what’s the minimum amount of money you should save up for a car, anyway? I’ve heard of saving at least $5,000 so you don’t have to spend a ton on repairs?)\\n\\nThank you for reading. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!   \n",

She's in a \"flat spin\". Continuing to do the exact behaviours I cut her off for in the first place. I have enacted the consequences of no contact with a minimum period of 6 months.  This applies to Obliviouranus, BIL and SIL. FIL has kept the door open to talking to me and at some point I will talk to him. He is as much a victim of Obliviouranus as GMIL, DD, and me. I also dearly love him and want to have a relationship with him.\\n\\n\\nDH and I discussed how no contact can end. Taking all of your suggestions on board I said that an admittance of wrongdoing, genuine remorse for past actions, a sustained change in behaviour, and continued adherence to our boundaries for the next 6 months would be a good start. Professional help for what is looking like a textbook case of NPD would go a long way. That is unlikely given the nature of NPD and the narcissist lacking capacity for empathy and insight. I also put in a new boundary - I will not be taking on the role of scapegoat again. He wasn't even aware that's what it was and what I did at his request. I explained it in the framework of NPD and he understood. \\n\\n\\nGMIL has finally reached a place of acceptance about going into care. DH and BIL have taken the lead with her consultation and approval. I think she understands that getting away from Obliviouranus is the right move. At least in that respect I feel as though I did all I could and we got a good outcome for GMIL.\\n\\n\\nI will continue my own therapeutic journey alone.  I have suggested to DH he does the same as he needs someone to talk to as well and I'm sick of talking about his mother with him.  He was profusely apologetic about making the call to separate our family on the faaaaaamily holiday. I politely informed him that me and DD will not be going on said holiday. Discussion ensued. DH also doesn't want to go on holiday with his faaaaaamily (quelle surprise). We will do something together, Just the 3 of us, instead.\\n\\n\\nWhen we tell the faaaaamily we're not going on holiday with them there will no doubt be more tantrums from Obliviouranus. Not my circus, not my monkey's. DH can tell them. It would only cause more headaches us being there than not. Let them enjoy their holiday and the consequences of their actions.\\n\\n\\nSo, for now, it's over. Thank you again for all the supportive comments and DM's. I couldn't have taken out the trash without you all and now my part in this saga comes to an end.....I hope!!\\n\\n\\nEDIT: All y'all that said \"It ain't over\" have an updoot. Obliviouranus has finally emailed back. Did I read it? No. Didn't even open it. Moved it straight into the folder with all the other garbage I've collected about this saga. Her behaviour since sending the email, and the 9 days it took for her to reply, said more than whatever trash she's written to try and get her way on the faaaaaamily holiday. She doesn't even know we're not going yet lol. I'll wait till that bombshell drops and let DH deal with the fallout, then I might read it and laugh at her pathetically manipulative tactics. NC is NC. I'm not even interested.   \n",

If you look back at my post history, you’ll see that earlier I posted about how Margot (my now JNMom) was upset I posted a status on bookface about my baby without informing her first, as I’m not sure how to attach previous post from mobile. \\n\\nLittle side note: I just hit 20 weeks Tuesday, had an OB visit that same day. Little girl is weighing in at 13 oz and right on track. Hubby and I are so excited! (This plays a role in this post)\\n\\n\\nEarlier today, I posted a status all excited about how baby girl was growing and how she refused to stop moving during the ultrasound. It was meant to be a happy post, and a happy time for everyone. Turns out, it wasn’t. \\n\\nMargot sends me a text stating that it would have been nice to hear the news first before posting it on Facebook. Asking why, she said because she had to find out when or after everyone else (This included my father). \\n \\nI made note to let her know that no one knew the information, including my father, before posting it. I made a comment stating that she found out just like everyone else on Facebook. She FLIPPED!! \\n\\nMargot said she wasn’t “everyone else” and should get to know before hand, because she believed we were closer than her finding out a different way. Margot went on to say how I had hurt her by saying she was just like everyone else, and how it wasn’t right that I didn’t tell her about MY baby before posting it for everyone to see. \\n\\nMargot decides to message my sister screenshots of our texts, but little known to her, I was with my sister helping out at her place. I explained my side to said sister, who agreed that I had done nothing wrong by posting without addressing my mother first. We’re both grown adults and moved away, yet Margot seems to believe she can still tell us what to do. She learned today she couldn’t. \\n\\nAfter hours of going back and forth, my JustNo step mother decides to jump in, messaging my sister and I in a group message. She begins by saying how she will not allow anyone to hurt Margot any longer, including us. Continues by saying how Margot is on the verge of hurting herself because of the drama going on and how it is strictly my fault. She made it a point that if anything were to happen to Margot, she would never forgive me. \\n\\nThis is where I had enough (as if before wasn’t the breaking point). I let my step mother know that she is responsible for getting her spouse help, and if she refused and something happened to Margot, it would be strictly her fault and no one else’s. Of course, step mother tried to deny this, saying I pushed her to do it. So, I called the cops! \\n\\nSheriff calls me to ask what’s going on after stopping by Margot’s home and she wasn’t there. Super nice guy, I explained it to him and said that I didn’t receive any direct threats from Margot, but from my step mother who was talking to her; Margot refused to answer me or my sister. Because Margot was still at work, this guy calls over to another city to have a unit sent to her work!! She was embarrassed to say the least. \\n\\nFurious about being embarrassed, Margot finally messages me and says never to do it again. I informed her that if she refused to get help, or step mother refused to get her help, than I would gladly call the cops again if it meant knowing she was safe. Margot must not have realized we knew this was her manipulation tactic, as she has used it before. Made a point to let me and my sister know she would never tell anyone before she hurt herself/committed suicide before doing so, not even step mother. \\n\\nThen the final breaking point of it all: Step mother sends a text to both me and my sister, stating that hers and Margot’s lives no longer concern us and not to get in contact with them. Uh, okay? \\n\\nMargot finds out about this in a group message between me, her and my sister. She tries to backtrack what step mother said by saying she never said that, she just wanted a break from us and that what she says goes. NOPE! Not going to work for me. I let her know that no matter how mad you may be at your children, you NEVER tell them you don’t want them apart of your lives anymore. Especially over nothing! Step mother (who has never had kids) made a comment about how I will learn when my little girl says that to me when she’s older. When asking what she meant, step mother said I told Margot she didn’t matter and was just like everyone else. The problem is, I never said either of those things. Step mother also made it a point to let us know that if anything happens to Margot, neither will text, call or email about her to let us know she is okay. \\n\\nWe finally get down to the last few texts, and I made the clear decision to cut step mother out of my life completely, and Margot and I are taking a long break. Poor sister was dragged into this by Margot and step mother, wanting her to be on their side. Both frustrated when she refused to take sides and told Margot everything she didn’t want to hear. She didn’t do anything wrong, but had it taken out on her right along side me. \\n\\nBasically, Margot got upset I didn’t tell her the baby’s weight before posting it on bookface for everyone to see, threatened to hurt herself over it and then gets pissed off when I called the cops to check on her. Step mother will no longer be apart of my life, neither her nor Margot will be getting any updates on my little girl,  and Margot and I are on a long break from any sort of communication. \\n\\nWhat was supposed to be such an exciting time has turned miserable. Only my father will get to know anything going on with the baby from here on out, and DH and I decided to keep everything relating to our little girl off bookface entirely. \\n\\nThat’s all for now! We will see how long Margot holds her silence towards me and my sister.   \n",

She was dismissive and near silent the first time I met her, and she proceeded to tell my DH that I was using him for his money (we both worked retail and at the time I made more money than him) later that day after I had gone home. When my husband told his parents he was going to propose to me she wasn’t exactly supportive, and later that year when we informed them we would be moving our intended 2020 wedding date up two years (to save $400 a month in insurance as my husband was going to change jobs) her words were “this isn’t an invitation to have children.” She has not been supportive of our marriage and has called me his girlfriend time and time again, only truly acknowledging our marital status once. My husband worked for his uncle for a spell ((this was the job he went to that caused us to get married to save money)) before leaving that company to work for another; at a family dinner his uncle asked what the benefits of the new job were in comparison to those at his company and before my husband could answer MIL said “HE WOULDN’T KNOW, they decided “LETS GET MARRIED” instead of looking into it!!!!” It was loud and awkward and pissed me the hell off as NO ONE reacted. These are the most obvious examples of the strained relationship that are necessary to share.\\n\\nOnto the point of this post...\\n\\nSometime last year MIL (who can’t be taller than 5’ 1”) got herself a brand new yee yee truck that’s entirely too large for her; she only drives herself around as two of her three children don’t live at home and the youngest has his own truck for transport and she never hauls anything anywhere. Early this year she left my (now mostly JustNo) FIL. A few months ago she signed a lease on a duplex before checking if the yee yee truck fit in her garage. It technically fits, but she is by no means a small woman and it’s not comfortable to get in and out. She also already damaged the back wall of the garage while backing in.\\n\\nMy husband and BIL took a few loads of things while she was moving in and MIL realized that his truck fit in her garage perfectly. So she propositioned husband... why don’t we swap trucks? They would continue to pay the same truck payments (hers is less as she put more money down) because they’re due to pay their trucks off at the same time, and then once they’re paid off in full my husband and I will begin to pay her the difference.\\n\\nI said no.\\n\\nMy husband and I recently bought our first home. The neighborhood we live in is safe, though cars parked on the street are prone to being broken into. Especially if they’re brand new. My MIL’s giant truck likely won’t fit through our fence (my husband already has to pull in slowly to make sure he doesn’t do any damage) and I don’t want him parking on the street every night.\\n\\nMy husband relayed the message. About a week later she propositions him again. All the same details as before but this time we don’t pay a difference. I guess she thought that paying the difference was my big issue. I told husband no, again, for the same reasons as before. Only this time I tell him it’s neither of our fault that she chose to leave his father and rent a duplex before making sure her truck fit not is it our fault that she continues to choose such large vehicles. I suggest that she trade her truck in for a smaller vehicle and he says she’ll never do that. Annoyed, my response was “oh well 🤷🏽‍♀️” and I ended the conversation.\\n\\nToday he informs me that she’s brought it al up again. Her “new idea” is that we don’t have to pay a difference for the truck... aka the last thing I said no to. I said no again, but he can’t seem to understand why I won’t try to help his mom out.\\n\\nAm I overreacting by saying no? Is it justifiable that I’m so angry that she’s trying to play us by suggesting the same thing (twice!) and presenting it as a new, better for us plan a few months later as though she’s helping US? And why the fresh hell will she only ask him this, but never bring it up when I’m around (granted, this isn’t often as I’ve taken the opportunity to be LC with both of my in laws since they split.)   \n",

format, Rant but advice wanted, am I overreacting?\\n\\nMy mom was not always a JN, most of the time she was a JY but after being introduced to this group and recent events I’m not sure anymore. I know others have it way waaay worse than me but these are just the straws finally breaking backs. \\n\\nI am 23 and have lived with my boyfriend for over a year now. I’m a huge nerd and have always wanted to go to the big city comic on in my state; been something I’ve wanted to do and vocalized to both parents since middle school but I haven’t got to go yet due to financial stuff. My mom says it’s a waste of money, not fun, super crowded, etc etc. I was gonna go this year which I told her about but my Life happened and I couldn’t go and again she said it wouldn’t be fun and what not. Well get a picture and it’s my mom dressed as an Xman character that she chose due to the stripe in her hair (looked good not gonna lie) and asked how I liked her costume. I was like ok what’s it for? And she said “oh me and GC little sister are going to comic con in 2 wks. It was a spur of the moment thing.” \\n\\nClearly the hell not if BOTH of you ordered costumes 2 MONTHS PRIOR to said event after I told you I couldn’t go and ridiculed me for wanting to go in the first place. “Oh we are going to a smaller comic event first and didn’t even think about comic con until just now and GC really REAALLY wanted to go!” So she says she orders the tickets for her, GC and brother but that I can come to; tickets are sold out and again no cash. Brother doesn’t wanna go so he says I can have his ticket. Crisis averted, I get to go right? \\n\\nTurns out she didn’t order the third ticket because she knew brother didn’t wanna go even though I offered to pay her back for the ticket once I got paid 4 days later. Apparently, she didn’t have the money to buy all three tickets but was going to pay for my brothers? \\n\\nAnd now I find out from a third party that she’s been planning this huge Disney trip but hasn’t said anything to me about it. Like am I overreacting? It just hurts being excluded and being the last to know.  Thanks for making it this far!   \n",

     I hate that title, but we have mostly good news! Every bit of tissue removed was precancerous, high-grade/severe dysplasia, so no treatment needed, everything has been removed, just close monitoring, regular blood tests and other unpleasantness to ensure it doesn’t reach that point again, spread or develop into cancer. His doctor is getting a big old bottle of booze for being the only one in nearly 20 years to take his family health history seriously. If I wasn’t married I’d kiss that man on the mouth.  Might still, Idk he’s pretty much given my spouse 60+ more years on this flying rock. Said if he had gotten this done a year from now it may well have been too late. \\n\\nWe ended up telling one very dear friend and one of my siblings. Not (feeling like) having to tell SMIL, my NM, or AIL was the best decision. Not having to comfort other people or put their feelings first was absolutely the right choice. I feel so much lighter realizing that I don’t have to tell anyone anything, moments of guilt happen, but it’s worth the freedom to focus on my family than how others feel. \\n\\nWe’re going to continue NC with SMIL since the trash took itself out there. My mom will remain on a strict info diet since she’s mostly BEC and we’re like 5,000 miles away and the JustNo moments really only happen in person and no bitch I will not be building a house on your dream cult like compound. AIL will remain on LC because I just don’t give a shit anymore. \\n\\nI’ve got my DH and our LOs, we’re healthy, happy, and planning more amazing trips just the 6 of us, further hammering the point home that WE are a family and everyone else is extended, and unnecessary in our every day life/ life choices. \\n\\nThanks again to every who offered advice, [thoughts and prayers](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/uNchJ) crystals and whatever deity you believe in. It gave us a bit of a spine shine, and a lot of comfort these last few weeks.   \n",

So I decided to share some of the good stories - partially to finally heal and partially to give some of you out there that it is possible to transform a JNMIL to a slightly annoying MIL. \\n\\nI met my DH when i was 19 and about to move to another city 2h away to continue my study. It was the kind of meeting where you immediately know you met your soulmate, the person you are going to spend the rest of your life with. So we did the only logical thing and decided to move together after knowing each other for only a couple of months. My parents were excited for us and on board with the plan. \\n\\nHis parents on the other hand.. well.. Let me tell you about first meeting my MIL. Before we moved in together I've seen her only once for a brief moment. She was close to her 60th birthday rocking long peroxide blonde hair, tight glittery jeans and a \"shirt\" I'd call a bra at best. She was nice I guess, but I was far too distracted by her looks to actually focus on the conversation. I won't talk too much about my FIL, just as a side note, he got the nickname Teletubbie from my parents - and that sums up his looks, attitude, behaviour and pure essence of his being. \\n\\nDH is a smart dude and over the years living with her he has became a master of avoiding triggering drama (no shiny spine was to be found there). So he never told her he is moving out, until the day he simply packed up his tings and left. Back then I thought it was an asshole move and gave him a hard time for it. I wanted a nice relationship with my MIL and was blaming him for ruining it. Boy, I was wrong. \\n\\nAfter some weeks of NC they decided to come and visit their son, to see how he lives and if he's doing ok. I did my absolute best, cleaning up for days, planing what we could do and how I'll apologise for DHs behaviour to put everything back in line. \\n\\nSo the big day came, they walk into my house without as much as saying hello to me, just focusing on their baby boy, having a short look around the place, acting like it's the worst shithole they ever seen and asking DH to go out for lunch with them. DH said something like \"sure WE will go to lunch with you.\", what made her decently unhappy(er). We sat down and had a long conversation about how my parents and family as a whole are horrible people for having some extra money, how my childhood must have been hell (my mom was putting down a pretty awesome career) and basically how everyone i ever knew was a shithed - she did her research. Then we went down the \"she is so amazing, and smart and pretty and ...\" road, followed by what i great mom she was. 4h of my life I'll never get back. But at least she talked to me, I thought. \\n\\nIt was getting dark and that meant it was almost over, we were standing in front of our apartment building and saying goodbye, and I started slowly relaxing, she even went in for a fucking hug. I thought I made it. But then it came - she turned to DH, looked at him and \"You know we love you, no matter the people you decide to let close to you. I'm telling you this is not a safe place and money makes people ugly. You should go searching for love, not money. Whenever you decide it's time for you to come back home you're always welcome, just call whenever and me and daddy will come to pick you up.\" And they left. We stood there, both, in shock. \\n\\nAnd that was the first of many JN my lovely MIL pulled. They got worse with time progressing and no one doing anything about it. But that's stories for another time. \\n\\nAlso: I'm taking suggestions for a nickname since the ones given to her by my family are too harsh and NSFW.   \n",
       "950  I'm not sure where to start on this, I'm 22F and my boyfriend (BF) is 23M and we have been together for 1 year and 3 months. We have lived together at my parents house for a year (fast I know but we knew each other before we got together officially) and we are smitten. My BF and I have discussed marriage and our future together in depth and are extremely excited about our lives. The only problem lies with my boyfriend's mum (FMIL = future mother in law) and by extension his close family (dad &amp; younger brother). A bit of background about FMIL is she lost her mother two years ago in a tragic way and has unfortunately not coped with it well at all, she is in deep, deep grief and is still very affected by what happened.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy BF works as a chef, if anyone knows about that trade then they understand the hard, unfriendly hours they work. He often works 7am-10pm shifts with a 30 min break in between. He can usually squeeze one day off a week and if he is very lucky he gets two days. This has been his life since he has been 18 and he hates it. He feels he was pushed into this trade by his parents and he his very stressed and emotionally drained, when he gets a day off he likes to catch up on sleep, relax and play some video games but we have still managed to see his family at least once a month since we moved in together.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy FMIL calls my BF and asks when his next day off is, he doesn't know as his schedule is never updated un till a day or two in advance and constantly changes but he says he will tell her when he knows. He rings her and tells her the day off when he finds out and she replied asking if we wanted to meet up in the city and he said maybe but he'll text her and tell her closer to the day. It turns out my BF's kitchen chef was on holiday so he had to pick up their jobs as well as his own so he was extra exhausted this day off and just wanted to sleep. He text his mum that he wasn't going to meet up and we didn't think much of it until 2pm the next day when his was phone was blowing up with phone calls and messages from his mum and brother. He answered and she said she was in the city, where was he? He said he text to say he wasn't coming and she said he didn't and she was waiting for him. My BF said he wasn't even dressed and the call ended. His brother then started messaging telling him he knew mum missed him, how could he do that to her, a lot of things a long the line of that. He offered to take them to a meal on his next day off and everything seemed to calm down.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWe both went to the meal and it went well, no one talked about what happened and we had a fun time. A few days later there was an emergency in my family and I accidentally called 'dad' on my BF's phone instead of my own but he didn't answer. I realised my mistake and tried phoning my dad on my phone when my phone started blowing up. I was desperately trying to get a hold of my dad but every time I tried to ring him I couldn't has they where ringing me. I wasn't interested in talking to them as I was worried about my dad so I messaged the brother to please stop ringing me. He didn't stop and at this point I was frustrated and said can you please stop spamming me, there are other people in the world who have things to do, or something to that effect. The calls stopped and I was finally able to ring my dad and get ahold of him (he's okay btw) and didn't think much of it.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nA few days later my boyfriend gets a call from his mum, he puts it on loudspeaker because he was gaming at the time. The first thing she says is \"Are you with HER\" I immediately looked at him and he gave me a funny look and responded with \"no?\" and his mum said good \"I don't like her, I don't like how she talked to your brother, I think she is really rude\" my BF looks shocked and we both are looking at each other open mouth and before he can answer she says \"are you still planning on doing that engagement thing?\" and he answered \"yes\" and she said \"oh...\" in a very sad trailed off way. The call ends and we are both wondering where that came from, my BF's dad's birthday was coming up soon and we knew we where seeing them in a few days so my BF text them something like \"I don't like how you talked about someone I care for and I don't want you to start anything so we won't be coming to dad's birthday\" She responded how I should of told them that he was okay as they where worried about him because his dad got a missed call and my BF stood his ground and said that he doesn't think I was in the wrong and that he wouldn't agree with what she was saying. She then sent him this text message which has really been making me feel uncomfortable, here it is copy and pasted:\\n\\n\"You don't know how much I miss you, some nights I cry because I don't see you. I miss your smell your smile and the sound of your voice. I'm happy that you have met someone that makes you happy and sometimes that's hard for me to know someone else is giving you a kiss and a cuddle every day and I cant do that. It was so hard when I lost my mom and now it feels like I have lost you 😭\"\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI don't know where this came from, he told me her rarely saw her at home because of how much he worked. It made me think about a few things that had happened in the past with her that I didn't really take notice of. She posts about her mum on Facebook anywhere from 1-6 times a day and recently she has started adding my BF into the posts acting like he has passed on as well.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy BF texted his dad as he was worried about what his mum said he told him that she misses her family but made sure to name them all but not me. It was just strange. It has been a few days now and his dad's Birthday was today, I sent him a gift and a card from both of us and my BF text him to ask if he received it and said it was from both of us and he just replied he got it and thanks \\*insert BF's name\\* and later when he opened it he texted my boyfriend to thank him, but made sure to just put his name and not thank me either.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI am so confused as to what is happening, does she think I have replaced her son? She has always done little digs at me, like when we go out she uses a calculator app to total up our food for us to pay but we always offer to get theres and she always asked about my BF and doesn't really seem that interested in me but I just chalked that up to me being a bit new for her. It has made me feel like they where waiting for an opportunity to validate disliking me and now we're in this awkward position of not knowing what to do. If she knew how much I did behind the scenes maybe she wouldn't think of me so negatively, I have to push my BF to text them back and often end up doing it myself, he won't ring them back, I literally have to start the call and then he has no choice but to talk to them. I buy and send all the presents for his mum, dad and brother since we've been together for every occasion. I push him to visit them and talk to them when we do go but now I'm the enemy?  Also she doesn't know any of this stuff and doesn't know I am aware of what she has said.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI'm sorry this has been so long but I am really trying to stop him losing his family, but he thinks we should cut contact until they treat us equally, what are your opinions?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR: My boyfriend's mum may think I have replaced her in his life and dislikes me but doesn't know that I am aware. How can we move forward?   \n",

We dunno yet. Hes apparently been slacking on his fines since hes on probation. Hes also due back in court next month. Or so QBR said in her very whiney cry screaming voicemail she left DH this afternoon.\\n\\nI was taking a nap with my kittens and his phone rang and it was her. The phone woke me up and I asked who it was. The look on his face told me everything. He was pissed.\\n\\nDh: my mom..probably leaving a long ass voicemail even though she knows I'm trying to call back.\\n\\nHe then listens to the voicemail and shes scream crying that she needs money, any money cuz she has none.\\n\\nQBR: DH, I need money, ANY MONEY, RIGHT NOW! AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! my powers getting turned off. Dad hasn't paid his fines and is going to jail unless we pay them! GCSIL won't help us and BIL isnt speaking to us. I just need money. Anything. Call me back. *sniffles* i loooove you.\\n\\nDH is fucking raging. Calls her back and she repeats herself but wont explain where all their money went. He explains that he can't help them either because him \"working for her insurance\" royalty screwed us. I lost my health insurance, food stamps, and now have to pay hundreds out of my pocket for my drs and my medicines. Also now what little food stamps we got are gone so that's even more we have to come up with.\\n\\nShe didn't care. She still had the balls to ask for help with money. Even asking DH if he would just borrow it from my mom. He said, again, NO. And repeated that cuz of her dumb idea we need the money and can't afford to give it to her. She gets upset and hes rolling his eyes and rubbing his temples as hes talking to her. I'm covered in adorable fluffy babies who are trying to get his attention. Finally he says \"I'll let u know\" and just hangs up. Then the fluffiest one attacked his toes.\\n\\nHe did say that when he gets paid by our landlord for fixing his \"older than jesus christ\" mini van he would help. But what he didn't tell her is, it's just coming off the rent. And that van's never getting fixed, it's too fucking old.

  Maybe it's the hormones. When MIL found out about my pregnancy, she was overly ecstatic. Not because she was happy for us, but because she had been talking about wanting grandchildren for YEARS even before DH and I got engaged.\\n\\nWe knew she had been collecting baby stuff for years. Books, blankets, etc \"for all her grandbabies to use\" that she keeps at her house. Totally fine... because they're kept at her house. Now that I'm pregnant, she's started buying clothes. When she told me she ordered some stuff, she mentioned it was getting shipped to our house. I said thanks so much because we haven't bought anything yet and these would be the first items LO officially owns. Then she said \"well, when LO grows out of them, please send them back to me so that BIL and SIL can use them for their LOs.\"  Sorry, what? BIL is married to a model. His wife is a size zero and has made it very very clear that she is nowhere near ready to have kids yet because her image is her brand and she doesn't want to give it up, at least for the next 10 years. SIL is unmarried, not dating, and has stated she only ever wants to be the cool aunt. She's very clearly not ready to have kids either. \\n\\nFor the foreseeable future, DH and I are going to be the only couple with children. Why can't she buy clothing items or books that are specifically for our baby? Is he/she not special enough to get their own blankets and toys and pjs? I feel like LO should be treated an individual, not just the first round of grandbabies.. Clearly the package she ordered is going to come to our house. I plan on sending it back or getting it forwarded to her house.\\n\\nAm I in the wrong here for being ungrateful for these \"gifts\"?  It's very likely we'll have another baby in the next few years and (never say never) BIL and SIL won't be trying to have kids yet. I'm not against hand-me-downs at all, but I wish she'd treat LO like an individual person.   \n",

poster, not on mobil, spelling is my own fault since english is my native tongue.\\n\\nTLDR at end\\n\\nBasic background on this, i have had \"two\" relationships, the reason for the quotation marks is because one wasn't official and ended before anything really happened (important later on).\\n\\nI don't know where to post this, and give it to me straight as well please\\n\\nSo onto the story\\n\\nMy (possible) JNMom and i are close, in looks and in a bond. But there is one thing that always bothers me, and its her involving herself in my relationships, friend and more. So i'm a sophomore in high school and have only had two relationships, one i ended myself and one was ended by him.\\n\\nThe first relationship was ended by him, but finding out, my mom has a blabber mouth, and spills almost everything i ask her to keep secret. the gut broke up with me over text after a couple months. i'm obviously upset, and i'm crying in my room. then in comes mom. she trying to console me since he was the first guy to like me back, and she accidentally lets it slip when she was talking to his mom she mentioned me liking him (or something like that, its been over a year since that incident) and i started crying harder and kicked her out of my room because i swear she caused the breakup because his mom can be over protective. \\n\\nTurn around to my second relationship with a guy i will call Richard, for many a reasons. i ended it with him last June after a fallout of sorts. Turn around months later and he starts dating my \"Little sister\" ( a friend). she's a freshie and he's a senior, so slight problem in my eyes. I dont like the relationship and they have been dating for a few weeks at most. Heres where my mom comes in. She knows i dont like that relationship. While i was at an award show, my parents went out and were having fun when she sees his dad and my \"little sis\", hes no where to be found. later, she sees them all three of them. She never told me until today. which is the breaking point for me. because that was last weekend\\n\\nim worried shes going to continue to do this shit. So, am i over reacting?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTL:DR: Mom has ruined a relationship in past for me. Blabber mouth to others and hides secrets from me about ex and \"Little sis\" relationship which i don't condemn because of freshie and senior ages.   \n",
