Apologies if this is too long but I need to get this off my chest.

I've never got along with my sister, (I'm 24 she's 32) she always treated me like I was a hassle and never had a nice thing to say about me. I feel so isolated because the stories she tells people make me not want to show my face, people know her more so of course they'll believe her over me, she even spread crap to my (already unbearable) Jobcentre work coach.

NOTE: I'm struggling to move out because no landlord will have a UC claimant and the DWP are taking 1/3 of my living allowance. I am in touch with housing charities and I am trying to get help. I cant work due to extreme anxiety to the point of frequent dizzy spells, severe migraines, nausea and sometimes even passing out completely.

9 months ago I had to leave my flat (for reasons that made me suicidal, not the first time I've been that way) and had to move in with her and her family. I had a long phase where every waking moment was so painful i struggled to breathe. I told her a few thoughts and she responded with ""I always knew you weren't strong enough"". I few days later I overdosed my medication, she found me and had me rushed to A&amp;E, I was in overnight having blood tests and my heart monitored (no lasting effects) the next day she visited and complained how my attempt stopped her from making some kid's birthday cake she promised she'd do. I felt safe at the hospital, the NHS staff were so lovely, when I got back I slowly started to improve (thanks to my wonderful nieces who took it upon themselves to mend my broken heart) and I was determined to help where I could.

I cared for ALL the animals, and the kids. I'd happily cook for everyone too, I was happy for a while, but my sister started to get more and more upset with me because of how I cared for her children: mending soft toys, clipping and cleaning scraggly nails, nit treatment and combing, teeth brushing routines and regularly cleaned clothes and bedding (I worship those kids). She tells them she'll help them but shouts if they ask, if I do something for them she says in their faces ""Am I not capable? Ey?"" and storms off. She bit my head off for getting them fed, cleaned and ready for bed while she slept (from 3:45pm - 9pm, past kids bedtime).

Next morning she sat next to me on the sofa, looked me in the face with an expression that could kill and says ""You make me feel like such a lousy mother"" and again, storms off.

My sister lives in a pigsty and expects me to clean up after her, she tells me ""compromise goes both ways"" and I'm being lazy, antisocial and a general leech, I do nothing to help myself (apparently). I have decided to be ENTIRELY independent and only care for my own (me and my pets). She and her partner want me to do even more since she got herself pregnant (another one she cant look after). She wants to be with me for the good things but when I need support she shuts me down, she gets extremely stroppy if she doesn't know everything I'm up to, If I don't tell her it means I'm on youtube or playing Skyrim 24/7 making no attempt to better my situation.

I feel defenceless around her, she has a very entitled know-it-all attitude that I cant stand. She tells me she hates the way I live (she must mean hygienically, and debt-free with great care for my animals, we've always been opposites)

She's determined she's right but it doesn't feel right to me. What are your thoughts? Am I wrong for keeping out of her way and making sure I only provide for myself and my pets?

Sorry for my horrible ranty post, my head is a mess, I'm trying my best.

My mother is self-absorbed. She doesn't care that my sister Katie and I were molested by my cousin Nick as a child and that I was treated like shit by my other cousin Ana (his sister) throughout my childhood and caught up in a hurtful, dysfunctional relationship with her as an adult (which ended with y cutting contact completely). My mom is more concerned with keeping “the family together” than acknowledging the damage that was done to me as a child and how it has affected me and continues to affect me as an adult. She is afraid. She is a coward. She is afraid of looking bad. She is afraid of any confrontation even if the outcome would be good for her kids. She makes up stories in her head and believes them and is afraid and paranoid. She was not an active mother to me as a child. But I did love her. She had a very happy and warm energy, and still does.  She was loving and comforting when it was convenient to her. She treated me like an inconvenience. I hated being alive. I hated who I was as a kid. I hate her. I don’t want to be around her or hear her stupid stories. I want to be away from it all.

According to her, “it’s a good thing Mike (Katie’s fiance) wasn’t able to come to the baby shower because if Nick happens to be there, Mike would be really upset.” What the fuck about ME and KATIE? It doesn’t cross your mind that WE would be upset? How about last summer, when I finally told you about all of this,  and you PROMISED me that I would never ever have to worry about seeing him ever again. She would talk to Aunt Terri and Uncle Paul. She would talk to Kip, my brother,  so that he knows what’s going on. Now that has completely gone out the window. Because she is TOO FUCKING AFRAID. She doesn’t give a fuck about how I feel. It’s about everyone else and her. How SHE will look. How SHE doesn’t want to start conflict in her family. FUCK that bullshit, I want out. I am getting out. After this stupid fucking wedding I will not be around her again. I am only doing this wedding for my sister because it matters to her and I love her. I cannot stand my mother. I want to leave now but at the same time I want to push through and be at the baby shower for my brother. He wouldn’t be hurt or angry if I wasn’t there though. It’s all a fake story that I have in my mind because of my mom. I love him and he loves me but he won’t be heartbroken that I’m not there. It’s a fucking 3 hour party. 

But I am an adult. I don’t need to be protected by her. She can do what the hell she wants with the knowledge of what happened to me. She can ignore it and have fake relationship with my aunt and cousins, just how she likes it. I won’t do it and I won’t put up with being around her while she continues to do it.

&lt;p&gt;It is frustrating for me to even talk about my plans. Whenever it comes to anything that would lead to spending money/ better life style, people react differently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think its a norm that people who own the most complain about how little they are getting, or they are prone to compare themselves with other people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone has similar experiences?&lt;/p&gt;

My twin sister and I lived with our mum. We lived in over 25 houses in the first 16 years of our lives. One particular year, we moved 4 times. The time came when we knew we would be moving again soon. The knocks on the front door would become more frequent. The hiding in our rooms or under our beds would become more frequent. The inability to answer the house phone would become more frequent. The isolation from mum's ""new close friends"" would begin.

We would start packing up our belongings and saw it is as a competition to see how quickly we could complete this. We became experts, eventually being able to pack and unpack a house in a day. We would put the radio on and sing and dance to music as a way to distract ourselves while packing. It stopped us from dwelling on the fact that we were moving again. It stopped us from thinking about 'why': mum had once again failed to pay the rent and the bills. She owed people money (her new friends, the landlords, her colleagues, her clients, or even our elderly neighbours).

Her lies had caught up with her again and she could no longer hide behind them. She had exhausted all her favours. She had exhausted the people's goodwill and they were starting to see the truth. That she had lied and manipulated them. That she had used her children and the fact that she was a single parent as a reason for them to feel sorry for her and to give her the benefit of the doubt. To let her have longer to pay them. To trust or have faith that she would come up with the money. Eventually they all came to the same conclusions. They realised that they needed to cut their losses and find a more reliable tenant. That her promises were empty. That they couldn't help us even if they had tried.

This process continued. Over and over. Mum worked as a carer with elderly first and then the disabled. She worked as a cleaner sometimes too. She had an infectious and bubbly personality. She could make fast friends so easily. Internally and behind closed doors, I look back and can see a lady who was deeply depressed. She would often spend days in bed. She had high levels of anxiety from all the lies she was living with. She was constantly trying to function at a heightened level to keep ahead of her lies. It got to a point where I'm not even sure she knew the difference between the lie she had created and the truth. She was a master manipulator. This was one of her biggest assets in a way, as it allowed her to continue to exploit people to feed her problem. She did this for so many years and never truly suffered the consequences of her actions.

We knew mum had a problem from the age of 7. We heard whispers from our family friends. That she was addicted to gambling. The pokies specifically. My sister and I were left to our own devices from that age. We would often be at home alone. Wondering what to eat. How to get it ready. When to go to school. If she would be home to take us or if we needed to find our own way there. If she would be there to pick us up or if we needed to find our way home. This became our life.

We were independent from a young age, not able to rely on mum to organise things for us. We worried about her of course, as any child would. When she was gone for long periods, we thought the worst.

Had something happened to her?

Had she crashed her car?

Had she been arrested?

She always had excuses about where she was. She had been at work. She had to stay later and longer. She was working hard to earn money to pay rent. Her car had broken down. She was helping a friend. She took someone to the hospital. The list continued.

In the end, we would hop on our bikes and ride from pub to pub. If we found mum's car at least we would know where she was and not have to worry. We would walk the streets late at night. We would climb on the roof and look into the distance, hoping to see her coming home. We didn't advertise to anyone what our home life was like. Our diet included two-minute noodles, macaroni and cheese, toast, and milo.

Sometimes on pay day, mum would do a shop and we would have food for awhile. Then it would slowly dwindle and we would go back to the basics. This has definitely impacted my diet to this day. Food has always been the lowest priority. We were used to going without.

Mum was on the wrong side of the law a few times over different periods growing up. From when we were 8, mum had some friends who could make money growing cannabis in their sheds and cupboards. The allure of money won mum over. Even though we were renting, her and her friends set up shop in the garden shed. They converted it into a hydroponic set up with the fluorescent lights and black lining over the walls. We didn't think too much of it. We knew it was illegal but after the first few crops and an influx of money, mum seemed happier. We had more food than we'd had in awhile. We didn't move house when the month came to the end so it seemed like there were more positives at the time.

The problem with this was that mum still had her underlying addiction. Often, she would receive the influx of cash and spend bigger at the pokies for longer. In the end, it only fuelled her problem to some degree. We continued to move house. The garden sheds got a little bigger and the crops got a little larger. We came home one day to find the crops were ready to dry out. The whole house smelt. Mum was sitting on the floor in the rumpus room with newspaper and scissors. She was cutting the cannabis. We sat down and helped her. I think we were 8.

Reflecting back on this with my sister, we laughed. We laughed at many things. We laughed at how we used to make a game of remembering the names of the streets we'd lived in and what order they were in from when we were born until now. We laughed at cutting cannabis with mum when we were 8. We laughed at the police and debt collectors who knocked on our doors repetitively over the years. We laughed at how mum had told them she was our aunty a couple of times and got away with it. We laughed at how mum used to change her last name. For bills, for jobs, for house applications. We couldn't keep up.

Was it Harvey or Watts or Nitsche?

We weren't sure. It allowed her to get away with things for longer.

Laughing, it seems, is one of our many coping mechanisms. In a way, we have compartmentalised this part of our life and locked it away. By not talking about it, we haven't really dealt with our feelings and we were both afraid of the impact of this on us now and later. This is why we have decided to share our stories.

Mum was the ultimate fraudster. She was given charge of our local soccer club finances one year. I think they figured she used to work in a bank so she was good with sums. They weren't to know she had an addiction and shouldn't be trusted. Mum used her knowledge of banks to then spend all of our soccer club's money. She got passed the need for two signatures and withdrew that money. I will never know how she got away with that and how no one pressed charges. The club folded soon after.

Another brush with the law came when mum was housesitting a work colleague's house. Unbeknownst to us, while her work colleague was overseas, she began pawning off her belongings. Jewellery, sporting equipment, electronics and the list goes on. This showed a desperate but opportunistic woman. Of course, her friend returned from overseas. She quickly realised her stuff was gone. She went to the police and this was mum's most serious encounter with the law. I remember she had to get lawyers. She went to court. The investigation and process dragged on for months. Mum was stressed and depressed. She asked our grandma to help her. Grandma gave her money. She paid for the lawyers. She bailed her out of another problem. She didn’t want us to be without mum. She didn’t want mum to have a criminal record. If only grandma could understand that she wasn't doing her any favours. Mum continued to gamble. She continued to lie. She continued to owe people money. I sometimes wish Grandma had let mum suffer the consequences of her actions back then. Maybe she could have been helped. We will never know.

In our minds, as my sister and I became more aware of what was going on, we decided we just needed to get through school. We wanted to be better. We wanted to do better. We needed to get away from this life we were living. We had aspirations and somehow, despite our role models, we knew right from wrong. We despised lies. We despised debt. We tolerated our mum but we didn't like what she had become or how she treated people. It got to the point where we didn't believe a single word out of her mouth. Everything seemed to be a lie. Even if she was just talking about her day, about a conversation she had with someone. Nothing could be taken as the truth anymore.

My sister and I threw ourselves into our schooling and our sport. Those were our outlets. Those got us through. The times continued to be tough. We held on to the thought that if we aimed high, we could eventually walk away from all this. We had each other. We inspired each other and we always felt so lucky to be twins. It was a blessing that there were two of us to support each other whilst we struggled through this life together.

Mum started to unravel at times when her guilt and desperation reached heightened levels. She would take her stress and anger out on us. She manipulated us into feeling like a burden. Like all her money problems were because of us. She would be irrational. She would search our rooms for money. We would have to hide. We were scared when she was in these states. We would sometimes roam the streets until she calmed down.

We kept our lives a secret. No one knew. Not our teachers. Not our friends. We were embarrassed and in a way, we felt guilty. We had lied. We had lied to many people. It had become second nature. We put up a facade in order to get the next house.

In order to keep mum out of trouble.

We didn't want her to go to jail and where would we live?

We weren't innocent.

We contributed to people being hurt.

To people being deceived and manipulated.

It was wrong but we felt trapped.

Where else could we have gone?

I don't regret many things in life but I do regret this. We were selfish. We were in self-preservation mode. We went along with the lies, which was wrong. Many people were affected by our mum's actions. Too many to name. They lost money. They had their trust broken. They even lost belongings that she sold or pawned. Some people were so vulnerable that they had no chance to even say no. The elderly, the disabled, and even her own family.

The last straw came many years later. Our grandma was progressing with her dementia. As the grandchildren, we didn't want to get too involved with grandma's finances. It's usually the parents who take care of these matters when they arise. Our grandma had one daughter and one son. Her son, on our recommendation, had placed grandma's money in a fixed term deposit account, not attached to her normal bank account. We had thought this would be enough to stop mum from accessing the bulk of grandma's money. But we were wrong.

Mum had gotten around that and taken grandma into the bank. She got her to sign a form to put the money in her normal account and had been withdrawing that money slowly but surely over a few months. Our uncle found this out when he came over from Tasmania for a holiday. He exposed the ugly truth. That mum could sink so low that she would exploit her own family. Her mother who had helped her time and time again over the years. Her mother who had dementia and was so trusting of her. She prayed on the most vulnerable. Grandma had always believed that mum could get better. That she deserved second chances.

We were all angry. At mum and at ourselves. We should have known mum wouldn't stop. That no one was off limits to her addiction and her lies. Since that day, we haven't seen or spoken to mum.

My sister and I took over caring for our grandma. We love her dearly. She is now in a nursing home. Mum doesn't know where she is. She has never visited her. Grandma asks about her most days. She knows what she did and it hurts her to think of what her daughter has become. For me, I feel better not having mum in my life. It's definitely easier. I don't have to worry what is coming next. I don't have to worry about answering my phone. I don't have to worry about debt collectors or friends chasing money from her.

The sad thing is that we don't know where mum is. We wouldn't know if she is dead or alive and that haunts me in my dreams.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up was hard. My twin sister and I lived with our mum.

Tldr at the bottom.

Within the past year, I (21 f) have been slowly realizing that I don't think I have a good relationship with my mom.

For a while, I've just felt like I need to grow up or that we just have really different personalities and it's my fault I dont like to be around her. I was really excited to go to college so I didnt have to interact with her as often and, again, thought I might have just been overreacting or hormonal. I've always made excuses to not visit her since then. I usually dont text her first and when I do it's because I feel guilty for not having interacted with her for a few days, not because I really want to. Sometimes when she texts me I dont even respond for a whole day. I can't quite put my finger on why I feel like this but I recently realized something that might help me put the puzzle together.

For years my mom and my dads mom have had beef. I'm pretty sure this was an ordeal even before I was born. I didn't really realize it was happening until I was about 15. My mom started talking mad shit about her around that time but it was never really specific. I have personally witnessed my dads mom say some shady things and so having only my own mothers side of the story I naturally sided with her. 

My mom and dad did not have a happy marriage for very long. I remember from a very young age that they had some issues. But that's a whole 'nother can of worms to step in. I was in my mid teens when my mom started to ""open up""  about her and my dads relationship. My dad never really talked to me (I daresay he was emotionally neglectful but again that's even another can of worms) so I never really got his side of the story. My mom just said some absolutely terrible things about my dad then when she was done ranting she would say something nice about him. Hindsight it just seems like she was afraid I would say something to him so she was just trying to cover her steps but idk. The point is she got me to take her side.

They finally got divorced last year and my dad has been very honest with me about the whole thing. He is telling me what my mom did wrong just like my mom always (always...) tells me what he did wrong. But what he does that's different than my mom is understand his own role in the failed marriage. He knows exactly where he went wrong and he is really trying to change for the better. And him opening up to me like that made me realize just how much my mom lied to me and manipulated me to hate my dad. 

Throughout my childhood she always threw shade at my friends and their families which has ultimately ruined multiple friendships, so like... more than one. Like I'm just realizing this as I'm writing this but she rarely had anything good to say about any of my friends and their families. I feel like a total asshole having taken her side so often. Again, I thought I had done something wrong but...

I'm finally a semi functional person with somewhat coherent thoughts and I guess I'm just starting to notice a pattern. I keep my distance from my mom because she makes me uncomfortable. My mom has always thrown mad shade at my dad and his mom. My dad opening up to me realized that my mom was telling me lies about him and it just makes me wonder what she was lying about my grandmother (dads mom) and my friends. Or what kinds of lies shes saying about me to her friends. She always made me believe she had a good relationship with me but I'm certainly questioning that now.

Idk, maybe I'm overthinking this or reading this situation wrong but it feels good to get this off my chest at least.

I would super appreciate some advice on the following situation. There's quite a bit to it in terms of my relationship with my dad..

I come from an Asian family and for some reason this sometimes means we just never communicate about our emotions. My dad unfortunately lost his job due to a fire and he's been doing manual labour type jobs his whole life. He loves it but obviously it has taken a huge toll on his physical health. He's generally ok but has a lot of pain in his legs and back because of his jobs but also because of various health issues. This is important to mention because he just refuses to do anything active like going for a run or a walk if the weather is nice just to kill time.

I feel bad for him that he's now been sitting at home for a couple of weeks seeming really bored. I would like to add he IS actively looking for jobs but not getting  anywhere because of his lack of qualifications. He occasionally goes out with his friends but obviously they all work so that's hard to do. I don't want to continue to watch him like this but equally I don't know how to talk to him about it in fear he'll think I'm just taking pity on him (this is where the whole Asian family type stuff comes in).

What do you guys think I could do with my Dad to help him actually live life a little? I'm a 22 yr old female btw, currently have all the time in the world as I just graduated and don't start my Master's programme until September, so I have time to help him out.

I hope you guys can help, thank you so much if you've read this.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys,&lt;/p&gt;

My older brother is 37 years old, and has been dealing with depression since his very early teens. He has been on medication this entire time, different ones prescribed by different doctors. He sees a therapist regularly. He meditates daily. Some days he's okay, and can laugh every now and then. But most of time he just seems miserable and emotionless.

&amp;#x200B;

To give a better perspective on our family dynamic, here's an overly long paragraph about us:

My parents separated when I was 6 (brother was 9). It wasn't a super messy split, but my dad refused to pay child support for quite a long time, and my mom ended up having to use all of her savings on court/lawyers fees to try and get him to pay. We lived with my mom (she struggled to get by for years), and saw my dad every other weekend. My dad's entire life has always revolved around soccer. He lives and breathes it. Most of my childhood was spent at the soccer field: my mom played it, I played it, my brother played it for a couple years, and my dad coached women's soccer teams, took teams to tournaments and ran the leagues in our city. To this day, a conversation with my dad would include a lengthy chat about soccer. I know he definitely chose soccer over visiting with us numerous times.

In all honesty, I don't really remember my childhood being that bad, I still felt loved by both my parents. But my brother seems to think differently. He has a very heavy dislike (hatred?) towards my dad. And my mom too, but mostly my dad.

Growing up, my brother always did really well in school. He's the smart one in the family, and has always has good jobs. He's had to loan my mom money several times in his life. I think he resents her for not being able to take care of us ""properly"".

&amp;#x200B;

Our family has also never been one to go out of our way to communicate with each other. We don't have any deep conversations about feelings, and we never have. My mom and I are very close, and I'm also quite close to my dad. My brother feels like an outcast. I recently found this out when him and I had a little drunk heart-to-heart outside of a wedding celebration. He thinks he's not like us, and he feels like he doesn't belong when our extended family gets together. (My mom lives in a separate building on the same property as my aunt/uncle, so by extended family I mean mom/brother/me/aunt/uncle/cousins).

When we're together, he's usually pretty quiet, although if he's in an okay mood he's very funny and can laugh and be sarcastic with the rest of us. He really is a lot of fun when he's at his best. It's rare though.

A lot of the time he's sarcastic, I'd say almost to a hurtful extent. I've dealt with it my entire life, so I take people's insults as jokes. I've always laughed off comments that my brother made to me, even if they were true. I think my dad did the same. My mom takes my brother's comments to heart.

I've been paying attention more recently to how he acts around me compared to how he acts around my parents. I moved in with him a few months ago (temporary job), and have noticed that for the most part, he can laugh and joke with me. I make stupid comments and he laughs, it's quite fun. When we're around our parents, he is very different. This is when he'll be quiet, moody, barely smile. He'll make little jabs at my mom (like I said, she takes them to heart, I can see the hurt in her eyes when he says them), and if he's around my dad it's so much worse. He endlessly (somewhat subtly) tells my dad that he's a shitty person. He makes so many snide remarks towards him, being completely serious, but my dad tends to laugh them off (I guess I learned this from him).

My dad is a hoarder, by the way. Not like the garbage everywhere kind, but he keeps everything. He has rooms piled with things (a lot of soccer stuff), and he doesn't clean the house or take care of himself. I know that he's recently gone a month without showering. He's also slowing down in his age (71), so I'm worried about him.

I think the hoarding that my dad is doing has created an even bigger divide between my dad and brother. My dad makes no effort to call/text/keep in touch with my brother. My brother barely makes an attempt at talking to my dad. Every now and then my brother will call him when he's waiting to board a plane (because he knows he'll have to hang up in a certain amount of time).

&amp;#x200B;

I've frequently googled how to help a depressed friend or family member, and all I get are the same results. ""Tell them you're there to listen, encourage them to get help, tell them it gets better"". I've told him I'm here to listen, he doesn't want to talk to me. He's been seeing a therapist for many years now, and has taken countless medications. He's been depressed since he was about 14, and it hasn't gotten any better for him.

&amp;#x200B;

He's still alone. He's had a girlfriend every now and then but nothing for more than a year or so. He's never been married. I know he wants to get married, I know he'd even like to have a kid one day. I think this gets to him a lot that he's still single.

&amp;#x200B;

It makes me so incredibly sad to see him like this, and I don't know how to help him. He truly is a great guy, and he deserves to find happiness and enjoyment in his life.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents don’t have a great marriage, and never did. It’s always been borderline emotionally abusive, sometimes physical (my mom has thrown things at my dad and has hit him). 
A couple years ago my dad almost died because of diabetes and is now disabled. As of now he’s prescribed oxy for the pain, and has been on it for 2 years. However, he is abusing it, and snorts it, passes out and drools on himself, etc. He has also started drinking again, at first it was just a couple glasses of wine, and now we have to hide any beer we have in the house. He’s an alcoholic, addicted to oxy, on the couch literally 24/7, and isn’t the nicest person. 
My mother isn’t the nicest either, I feel that she can be pretty selfish a lot of the time. For example, she hasn’t done her taxes in 2 years, gets mad when I ask her to, and I haven’t been able to apply for FAFSA. I’m always scared to say anything not positive about her behavior because she gets mad, yells at me, and insults me, usually calling me a drama queen and telling me to get over it. Because of my dad’s disability, bills are a little harder to pay because he’s not working anymore, and my mom isn’t working either. 
I am currently going to school for social work, and a lot of the time my mom comes to me with her issues because I have the right responses. However, I don’t want to be her therapist. She will talk to me about very personal problems, sometimes even bringing up her and my father’s sex life. A few months ago she had a mental breakdown, and our house was almost in foreclosure. I was the only one in the family who knew about this besides my mom, my brother and sister had no idea. She comes to me with these issues of money, running through all of their savings, 401K, etc. She talks to me about leaving him, moving away, and needing to “put herself first for once.” She also complains about how my dad is basically just killing himself, as he also had collapsed lungs and is smoking cigarettes a lot. But my mom also smokes, and I brought up how she shouldn’t smoke either because if she ends up in the hospital like my father did, I’ll have to deal with it all, as my siblings will most definitely not be helpful. When I said this she just brushed it off and said something along the lines of “I know, your father is useless and won’t help”

How do I tell my mom that this is an inappropriate relationship and it makes me super uncomfortable to be expected to act as her therapist? I try to distance myself but a lot of the time she just makes any conversation about this. Once we got in a fight and I tried to bring up how I don’t want to know about their issues, and she compared it to me having fights with my own boyfriend. I feel that going to your mother with relationship problems (and I never talk about sex or anything like that) is a totally different dynamic than what she is doing to me.

Back story: I am 26, recently moved home to try to save money for a house of my own. My mom lives in a second house on my grandparents' property, and has since she had me (single mom). We all split the utilities, and my mom and I do a lot of the yard work and maintenance for both houses, we shuttle my grandma to appointments and my mom looks after them when they're sick or injured, but not serious enough to need medical attention. She does things like help my grandpa with his toenails, and checks in on them, runs errands for them, etc etc.

I have called my grandma ""gran"" for probably 10-15 years, it's going to be a very hard habit to break at this point. I don't know why he's just now decided he doesn't like it. I tried to comply at first, to avoid drama, but damn if it isn't hard to call someone something new after so many years. It's making me extremely stressed. Family dinner is a nightmare, I just don't talk to anyone.

Today I was chatting with her and said something like ""thanks gran!"" and leaned down to kiss her cheek before I left, and he was like ""THANKS /WHO/???"" I just walked out without answering. I don't know what brought this on, and I'm stressed about confronting him, because technically our house is his house so he could kick me and my mom out if he got mad enough. My current strategy is just avoiding interaction with him, which also sucks-- because prior to all this nonsense, we got along great.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I did talk to my grandma about it, and she said it doesn't bother her that I call her gran. She's very non confrontational, but also extremely honest. I know that if she'd told him that she didn't care for the nickname, she would have told me as much. She, for better or worse, won't confront him about it. But said that I could call her gran if I wanted to and that he didn't have a right to tell me, what I should call *her.*","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My grandpa recently got a bug up his butt about the fact that I call my grandma &amp;quot;Gran&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

We all split the utilities, and my mom and I do a lot of the yard work and maintenance for both houses, we shuttle my grandma to appointments and my mom looks after them when they&amp;#39;re sick or injured, but not serious enough to need medical attention. She does things like help my grandpa with his toenails, and checks in on them, runs errands for them, etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have called my grandma &amp;quot;gran&amp;quot; for probably 10-15 years, it&amp;#39;s going to be a very hard habit to break at this point. I don&amp;#39;t know why he&amp;#39;s just now decided he doesn&amp;#39;t like it. I tried to comply at first, to avoid drama, but damn if it isn&amp;#39;t hard to call someone something new after so many years. It&amp;#39;s making me extremely stressed. Family dinner is a nightmare, I just don&amp;#39;t talk to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I was chatting with her and said something like &amp;quot;thanks gran!&amp;quot; and leaned down to kiss her cheek before I left, and he was like &amp;quot;THANKS /WHO/???&amp;quot; I just walked out without answering. I don&amp;#39;t know what brought this on, and I&amp;#39;m stressed about confronting him, because technically our house is his house so he could kick me and my mom out if he got mad enough. My current strategy is just avoiding interaction with him, which also sucks-- because prior to all this nonsense, we got along great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I did talk to my grandma about it, and she said it doesn&amp;#39;t bother her that I call her gran. She&amp;#39;s very non confrontational, but also extremely honest. I know that if she&amp;#39;d told him that she didn&amp;#39;t care for the nickname, she would have told me as much. She, for better or worse, won&amp;#39;t confront him about it. But said that I could call her gran if I wanted to and that he didn&amp;#39;t have a right to tell me, what I should call &lt;em&gt;her.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Sorry might be a bit longer with all the info, but the title says it all. Sorry for English, not a native speakeŕ.

I (M20) just finished my first year at uni in UK, my sister (F15) and parents live in a different country so I can't really know what is happening at home, I went there just twice for a week since September. My sister just told me that she had found out about the cheating about two months ago. Genuinely, I didn't believe her, it would never even cross my mind. But she took pictures of my mom's conversation and I must admit it is sadly 100% true. (btw My sis waited those two months to tell me what's happening until I come home, which must have been so hard for her and she has all of the credit for that.)

I was always saying that my parents are very contrasting in so many things and/or opinions. My dad is super stressed about everything, and quite disgusted by life, I'd say that the family has been the main engine in his life in last 10 years. He's not very happy with the way he lives and money he earns, but I know on 100% that he always gave everything to all three of us. I feel like he is a bit disappointed that he didn't do something big during the life, like he must have failed or something, can't really describe that properly but that might be quite normal at this lifestage (?) I can see that feeling was getting stronger and stronger in last few years.

My mom is calm, but sometimes even naive, and also quite submissive in the sense of making any decisions, she just says ""I don't really care"" or ""It doesn't matter that much"". When there were any small arguments it is usually because of the discrepancy in these character features.

I don't think that the age difference between them is the problem. Mom has always been into older guys, and sadly it is this time as well. I also doubt it is about money.

I have no idea what to do. I am thinking about telling to my uncle's girlfriend. I know I can tell her everything with honesty. She also stands kinda both in and out of the family as she knows my uncle (and thus my parents actually) for 15 years or so but doesn't plan a wedding or something and I believe she can see the thing subjectively.

I also kinda plan to confront my mom about that = should I ???? If yes, how the fuck??

Also, I am leaving in two weeks again and the last thing is to ruin the family and then just leave, so I must be really careful with what I'm doing.

This may be a wall of text too because so much needs explaining, so I do apologise for that.

So as the title says, pretty much my whole family have had enough of my mum and she knows this, although she doesn’t understand why. 

Let me start by saying she is a fantastic grandma to her grandchildren, she loves them and absolutely adores them. She is battling COPD and a plethora of health issues as well as depression, anxiety and PTSD from my grandmas death 4 years ago. That being said, her personality and behaviour is pushing family members away, and as I am closest to her, I feel it is my responsibility to explain why seeing as she’s noticed people becoming distant and/or angry with her and doesn’t understand why.

My mum is quite narcissistic, always has to be right, gives unsolicited advice, rants about people treating her like shit all the time, she’s two faced, constantly has a need for attention and that’s just off the top of my head. 
 
A few months ago, a family member I’ll call AH attempted suicide and, although she was specifically told not to go to the hospital, she went anyway. She said she was there to support AH’s children and the rest of the family. Everyone was so worried as AH had been clinically dead for some time, but my mum went around telling everyone that she had got people praying for her and she’s be fine. AH pulled through and her vitals stabilised and my mum had the ‘told you so’ mentality, but then to take things further she actually told people ‘told you she’d be fine, I’ve had people praying for her, it’s not her time’!, which obviously annoyed the shit out of people there. She couldn’t understand why people were being cold and sharp with her. It really did hurt her, but I struggle to explain why the way she acted was the reason why.
Then came the ‘I have mental health issues too, but no one rushes to my side when I’m in crisis’. This was the day after AH hung herself and was found clinically dead, it was because my brother was visiting as he is close to that side of family and my mum has a bit of a fractured relationship with that side. Recently, my mum and AH’s husband were chatting about AH and AH’s husband  sent my mum a couple of videos of AH as she had brain damage from the lack of oxygen. My mum obviously had to bloody ask him to let her and all of her other friends pray for her and he lost it with her. It’s just not his belief. And its annoying. She rang me in tears and all I could say was ‘ Oh you know what he’s like’. 

Everyone is just so sick of her, I love her to bits but she’s driving me mad too. She’ll ring me to rant about family members, how she’s feels like no one respects her etc.. and it’s never a positive experience to talk to her in the phone. I have depression and anxiety and I’m struggling with two small children to make it through the day, and her phone calls make me feel so much worse. But if I tell her this, she’ll tell me ‘at least you don’t have PTSD and COPD too’. 

I’m just lost and I don’t know how to approach this with her. I feel like I’ll be criticising everything about her and she’ll feel attacked, which is usually how she reacts to anyone trying to discuss her behaviour with her. 

Has anyone got any advice please? 

I’m sorry for the wall of text, I have missed loads out but it’s 10am and I have two very bored toddlers wanting my attention, also it would be one hell of a long read. I also apologise for the formatting as I’m on mobile.

I&amp;#39;d say what BOTHERS ME THE MOST is that when I&amp;#39;m wrong my parents are VERY CLEAR AND STRONGLY OPPOSE ME but they NEVER give me credit or concede when I&amp;#39;m right. If I want them to agree that I&amp;#39;m right, they complain I have an issue with pride and that I should accept everyone sees things differently. It FEELS like I CAN NEVER BE RIGHT. My family is the type of always remind you of your mistakes so you WILL NOT REPEAT THEM.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm looking for advice. I have a brother who is in a tough spot. He is in his mid twenties, he is unemployed, not in school, and still lives with our parents. He has little to no real social contacts, the few friends he did have in high school have long since moved away from our home town and no longer keep contact. He has never had a romantic relationship, he rarely leaves the house, and he has admitted to my mother and my sister in conversation that he is depressed and has, in the past, had suicidal thoughts. 

My brother is very intelligent. He was selected early in childhood to be put into the gifted/advanced placement classes in school. His SAT scores are higher than those of anyone in our family. He is well read, he has a near-encyclopedic knowledge of all sorts of trivia. He would be a perfect candidate to pursue a STEM major. He attended community college for some time, but ultimately quit before finishing an associates degree or transferring to a four year school. 

My brother has never been a socially inclined person. Growing up he didn’t care to play much with others. He didn’t play games with me as a kid. He has always been reserved. During family gatherings these days, he avoids group activities. He declines invitations to socialize. Even within the scope of activities that he enjoys, such as playing video games, he avoids people. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him play a multiplayer game. As a result, he doesn’t have a support network outside of our family. Even within our family, he refuses to open up. 

As far as I can tell, my parents do little to help my brother. They don’t work well as a unit. Their marriage failed many years ago, back when myself and my siblings were kids. As a result, growing up, they didn’t work well together to motivate us or push us in the right direction. E.g. if we got bad grades, my dad would get upset, my mom would stick up for us, and we’d just slip away while they argued. This applied to most serious topics. To this day they coexist, but they don’t work together to make any positive change in regards to my brother, or to their own situation. 

My sister managed to get into college when she finished high school, and not long after I graduated, I was invited to move in with some friends who were going to school about an hour away from my hometown. Since then we’ve both seen things go reasonably well for ourselves. She has finished her degree, I worked odd jobs for a while but now I’m back in school. Our parents now support our efforts. However, they won’t push my brother. He is stuck living in their basement. He is definitely unhappy, but I think years of isolation and a lack of parental support has left him in a state of learned helplessness. He lacks the will or self confidence to do anything to help himself, and my parents are too afraid to push him to do anything at all. 

I talked to my brother in order to encourage him to go to school, or get a job and move out our parents house. He seemed to accept that these could be positive changes, but has made no moves in those directions. I’ve talked to both of my parents about pushing him in one direction or the other, but they are both too afraid to push him. They are concerned that he won’t fit in well at work, and they are afraid that any major failure would be devastating to him. They both think his attending school is a good idea, but they haven’t made any real attempts to push him to attend. They both acknowledge that he might be better off if he lived somewhere else, but they haven’t tried to help him find his own place, and they are concerned that he wouldn’t be able to find a job to support himself or pay his rent if he did move out. 

I don’t know what to do. I know what its like to live in my family’s home. It was a self-defeating environment. I was very unhappy when I was there. When I moved out I felt like my quality of life improved dramatically. I want the same for my brother, but I feel limited in my ability to influence the situation. Does anyone have any ideas? Thank you in advance and sorry for the long post. I tried to condense this as much as I could but there is much to cover.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, &lt;/p&gt;

Hello, I'm a 17-year-old girl from the UK. My father is 87 and I live with him alone. Everything was okay-ish, difficult, but I could handle it, up until three months ago. He was hospitalized for a month, then again for 3 weeks last month. He was given a stoma bag (where you go to the bathroom out of a little opening in your stomach) and it's been impossible since then. He won't change it no matter how much you try to get him to until it explodes, and every day there will be poop all over the floors, chairs, bowls of liquid poop and dirty wipes in EVERY ROOM because he wanders around for some reason, and I try to clean it up as much as I can but it's impossible and I end up not being able to bring myself to clean all of it up as I feel like vomiting (I know it's babyish, I've always been terribly scared of bodily fluids and I can't seem to get over it).

I can't do all the laundry, so there's piles of soiled clothing and towels in the kitchen (unhygenic obviously but that's where the washing machine is). He can't walk properly anymore and therefore wets himself and gets it on all the chairs. He never communicates with me or tells me anything and he has now started falling over (yesterday I found him lying on the floor naked covered in poop at 3am) and he fell over getting out of the bath today. (I phoned 111 but they said if he's not showing any symptoms of damage we won't send anyone out). He is suddenly extremely confused and senile and often doesn't make any sense and talks nonsense, and starts shouting when I try to do things for him like insist he puts warm clothes on and let me get a heater for him when he was shivering, and he started saying nasty things about me which he has always done (he has always been a bit verbally abusive I think, which means I can't stand up to him much) but now I can't even leave the situation and go and be alone because then I wouldn't be there to look after him. I feel like a terrible daughter because I feel disgusted cleaning up after him and sometimes feel resentful as I can't go and visit my mother anymore or go out for more than a few hours. I've also stopped being able to shower often as I can't stand going into the bathroom anymore (he uses it daily and always has poop in it unless I spend a long time cleaning). He also gets angry whenever I seem upset by the poop (I try to hide it but it's hard) and tells me I'm treating him like a cow and that 'it's not poop, IT'S SUGAR, it's perfectly clean' and I still have no idea what that means.

When he was in hospital I told them not to discharge him as he isn't able to care for himself (he doesn't even take his medication which he's just told me today), and that I am scared that one day I will find him drowned in the bath, or he will fall over and crack his head or something like that, and then I will never be able to forgive myself. I told them he's not ready to come home but they didn't listen to me. I've phoned social services multiple times, they always say they are setting up a care system of nurses, it has been weeks and weeks and all they do is say they are still in the process of organizing it. We can't afford private care. One nurse comes in to do an injection and she does her best but it is nowhere near enough. None of the cleaning companies will clean up human waste like that and the NHS say they're sorting that out too but they clearly are not. My siblings don't like him due to his anger issues and clearly don't care enough to help (literally at all, even though they send me 'supporting messages' which doesn't exactly do a lot). My mother wants me to move out but I'm not going to leave my father to die. I feel as though the NHS are assuming I'm handling it and therefore aren't bothering to send help.

Also, he refuses to go to hospital again and says they are trying to kidnap him and keep him there. There's no way he would go into care or anything like that and I'm not going to force him against his will.

I don't know what to do and I just can't see a way out of this situation. Does anyone have any advice?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;ve phoned social services multiple times, they always say they are setting up a care system of nurses, it has been weeks and weeks and all they do is say they are still in the process of organizing it. We can&amp;#39;t afford private care. One nurse comes in to do an injection and she does her best but it is nowhere near enough. None of the cleaning companies will clean up human waste like that and the NHS say they&amp;#39;re sorting that out too but they clearly are not. My siblings don&amp;#39;t like him due to his anger issues and clearly don&amp;#39;t care enough to help (literally at all, even though they send me &amp;#39;supporting messages&amp;#39; which doesn&amp;#39;t exactly do a lot). My mother wants me to move out but I&amp;#39;m not going to leave my father to die. I feel as though the NHS are assuming I&amp;#39;m handling it and therefore aren&amp;#39;t bothering to send help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, he refuses to go to hospital again and says they are trying to kidnap him and keep him there. There&amp;#39;s no way he would go into care or anything like that and I&amp;#39;m not going to force him against his will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to do and I just can&amp;#39;t see a way out of this situation. Does anyone have any advice?&lt;/p&gt;

So, my school had a little field trip today. We all walked to a country club with a pool and tennis and other stuff. It was about 25-30 minute walk.

Anyway, after we arrived back to school, i asked my mom if i could go to starbucks so i can get something to drink. she said yes so i head down there and met my friend G.  I order a drink and G orders 4 waters because it was boiling hot outside. We drink our fluids and then i text my dad.

OP: Hey, dad you know starbuck near *insert school name*?

Dad: Yes why?

OP: Can you pick me up there? It's way to hot to ride home

And you wanna know what he said?

Dad: No, meet me at the school

OP: what! why? it's 103° outside!

Dad: Meet me at the school

OP: fine...

so i grab my scooter, throw away my drink and ride in the 103° heat just so my dad could pick me up at school. And he acts like nothings wrong! Also, I think I'm suffering from subtle or mild heat stroke. one of my friend might have it but idk

So my boyfriend and his brother have moved into my home. At first it was great as we were happy and things were working out but now I’m reaching my limit.

My boyfriends brother and I are not getting on. We don’t really argue, but when we do it’s bad. He always makes comments about me and my lifestyle as it’s very different to his. I am very close to my family and my mum and dad have been so supportive (as this is my first home and they want me to be happy) however this sort of things really annoys him and calls me spoilt as my family helped with furnishing the house by buying a table and chairs, a microwave and other appliances. He also says I’m spoilt as I have been travelling a lot, that my parents and I have been on many holidays and he seems to think I get whatever I ask for and it’s really getting on my nerves as my family have worked really hard for the money they have and I feel it’s their choice on how they want to spend it. I get that I am given a lot of things that some other people wouldn’t get but I don’t think that calls for him to attack me for it

He also picks on me a lot like he’s a child or something with little jabs about my personality, my intelligence and my opinions. For example, I have bad hearing (which he knows about) and he gets really annoyed and verbally attacks me when I don’t hear something or ask a question that’s already been answered and says I need to learn to listen. I am already really self conscious about my hearing as it affects me at work and with friends but it’s not my fault I can’t hear. I am having tests to see what’s wrong but that’s not good enough for him.

At the moment things are really awkward in the house. My boyfriend has tried to talk to him but then they just end up in a fight and I don’t know how long I can take it. He’s stressing me out as he doesn’t contribute around the house. I cook every night for him and my boyfriend always cleans up after while he goes and plays on his computer. He doesn’t do anything for anyone else and even though we all make it untidy he will only clear up his mess.

It’s really starting to affect my mental health. I’m already stressed out at work and now home isn’t a place I can relax. Me and my boyfriend can’t do anything without him joining in or judging us over it. It’s getting to the point where I want to leave the house, leave my boyfriend and just never speak to either of them again because I’m stressed, depressed and upset. This stuff is making me cry most nights.

We’ve had arguments, chats and even created a rota for chores and he’s still not changed his ways.

hi friends!
As FATHERS, WE have an important role in raising OUR children!

I recently met a quote - ""To be your children's memories tomorrow - you have to be in their lives today""

Studies show that children of involved fathers enjoy various benefits such as:
- Better performance at school!
- Less friction with legal systems!
- Good jobs and a successful career
- relationships with others!

And lots more things !! - a lot depends on US

She is a toxic person. I have a feeling she doesn't really care about my feelings, i think she just pretends she does. She is shallow and immature. She gets mad at me for the most stupid reasons, and she is constantly stirring things up, starting conflict, and when i react to the whole nonsense, she plays the victim. I ask her if she's angry at me and she says she's not but clearly she is. I've been trying to change the way i look at her. She will always be my mother. I came out of her vagina, but she is not my parent anymore because what she is doing isn't parenting, i think it's actually the opposite of parenting. 

&amp;#x200B;

Parents try to nurture and support their kids in their path to becoming independent and loving adults. I have the feeling my mother has been doing the exact opposite of that, always criticizing what i do, always comparing me to my older brother and cousins, trying to start rivalry, trying to make me feel insecure and miserable, reminding me of my past mistakes, the ones the had supposedly forgiven. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have a strong bond and i genuinely care about our well being as a family, but she uses that against me, because every time she gets mad i try to understand why and most of the time there isn't a real reason behind it, but i'm already trapped in her spider web, and she starts criticizing someone, and she expects me to agree with her but i generally don't so she gets mad at me when i wasn't even the reason she got mad in the first place. Then she spends three days giving me looks and not talking to me more than what is necessary. Then she just forgets the whole thing and she's acting like we're the perfect family. We are far from perfect, but she likes to give that image to others. She will irk me in social situations and then make a scene, letting everyone there know that she is mad at me, and then blames it on me, and whines about how terrible it is that our family or friends know we are not this perfect thing she wants everyone to think we are. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to avoid falling into the spider web but she knows what she is doing. I don't think she does it consciously, i think she just feels better when people are paying attention to her even if it's for all the wrong reasons. She is obsessed with cleaning. She spends at least three hours a day cleaning. If i dare to point out how out of hand her cleaning habit is getting, i will be punished and then ignored. She hasn't had a job in the past 20 years and keeping the house clean was her thing when me and my brother were growing up. My dad always praised how clean the house was and that made her proud of herself. But now my brother doesn't live with us, and my dad doesn't work that much anymore, and i think she feels out of place because we're all taking care of ourselves now, we don't need mom to clean after us, and she feels like we don't need her, so she cleans compulsively so we are forced to praise her work and give meaning to her life i guess. But she doesn't realize this cleaning addiction is not to be praised, its consuming her, and that difference in our views always sparks conflict. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm doing my best to not let her attitude interfere with my life, but i'm going through some hard times myself. I don't have many friends since i quit smoking weed and hanging out with my stoner friends. Also i'm not the best student, and my mom knows. I'm feeling quite lonely lately, and end up spending too much time at home, where she rules. I want to change that and make friends, but this situation is consuming so much of my energy. I cry myself to sleep too often. 

&amp;#x200B;

Have any of you gone through something similar? How did you change not to let the other person's attitude interfere with your mental health? Is it hard to make friends after being isolated for long periods of time? Will i ever recover from this toxic relationship with my mother?

I&amp;#39;m feeling quite lonely lately, and end up spending too much time at home, where she rules. I want to change that and make friends, but this situation is consuming so much of my energy. I cry myself to sleep too often. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have any of you gone through something similar? How did you change not to let the other person&amp;#39;s attitude interfere with your mental health? Is it hard to make friends after being isolated for long periods of time? Will i ever recover from this toxic relationship with my mother?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance&lt;/p&gt;

-This is no way to get sympathy, just honesty. When I was about eight, I was taken away from my family due to my raising being in a unhealthy environment. I lived with my mom's sister for about two years, but it didn't work out due to some of my emotional disturbances (self harm, drawing disturbing pictures to get attention, not caring about school, trauma from being taken from my mom, etc.).

-I then met my real dad when I was 14. My real dad and quickly moved out of the group home. It was definetly a culture shock. (My first year of highschool 9th grade) I still had some emotional disturbances. With my sister on my dad's side, I have always felt like I have faked a strong bond with her. Don't get me wrong, there have been good times, but overall I have never felt a genuine attachment towards her. I have never genuinely felt close with my dad's side of the family except for one person, my aunt. I do love her, or atleast the way I can.

-And then as I got older, I felt that the bond that I had with my mom's side of the family start to disappear. It was no longer the bond I felt when  I was 8 years old. My sisters, my grandma, and my mom all seemed to feel like strangers. It feels like people I've known for a long time. I feel no emotional attachment. I feel no emotional attachment towards my dad's side of the family. I could go years without talking to any of them. This is including a sister on my dad's side who I'm apparently ""bffs"" with. When I do go visit my dad, I get jealous of my little brother because my dad is raising him well. I'm jealous because my little brother is being raised by two very loving parents. I'm jealous because I see that my 9 year old little brother has more confidence than me. And apart of me makes myself feel bad. 

-I think not growing up with the same parental parents hs really screwed with my drive for bonding in general even with my self. Some people call it sociopathic, or depersonalization, or trauma, etc. It feels as though every interaction I have is fake whether it be with family or even with my own girlfriend who I've been dating for over 2 years. To be honest, the only time I felt intense emotion is when a girl breaks my heart, or thinking about my childhood warm memories when I have an adult beverage. For example I tear up when I was listening to the ""Little Bear"" intro show song. Things that strum up good nostalgia gets me, but usually only when I'm drinking.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so I'm 16 years old. I suffer from a lot of mental illness, namely really really bad anxiety, both kinds, and maybe ADHD? I'm transgender and my family is relatively ok with that, extended family is not as good but they're not too important. My dad is the super stoic type (have long suspected he never really wanted kids), and my mom is super emotional. When i was growing up, my parents didn't really have an understanding of mental illness (not their fault, but at least they should have thought something was up and looked into it, i was a REALLY weird kid). Being trans, i have to talk to a therapist and all that, and it's helped me way more with my mental issues, and being friends with other trans kids has practically gotten rid of my depression which is amazing since i was pretty suicidal as of like a few months ago. Anyway, after a session with my therapist, she talks with my parents about how i'm doing and to schedule and appt n stuff, which made my mother kinda realise that anxiety is something she's suffered from her entire life, especially since having kids. She's not a helicopter parent by any measure, but if i don't respond to a text or call within 30 minutes she really goes off the rails (not really my choice, phone is on its last legs and reception in our town is real spotty).

&amp;#x200B;

She just has massive separation anxiety with me and my older brother. He's 18 and is moving out for college by the end of the summer, and i'll be moving out next year (i'm gonna be a senior). He will be moving pretty far north, and my mom is not super ok with it. She is freaking out but i think she knows its reasonable to be ok with it, especially since he will keep contact. That is not what i want to do. Don't exactly want to discuss, but growing up with an undiagnosed mental illness and being closeted, plus just being a completely different person than both my parents put me through a lot of horrible things, and i grew to silently resent my parents. Living in this house is horrible and i hate being stuck here and dependent on them. **I do not love them.** They are completely unaware of this and still think i want to stay with them a few years after graduating high school. The only thing is, i know if i just cut them off my mother will FLIP. As previously mentioned, she gets separation anxiety and not knowing if i'm ok will not fare well for her. (i know i talked about not bearing to live with them but i don't wish any ill will on my parents. most of my hardship was the fault of their ignorance or completely unrelated to them. (also couldn't fit this anywhere else but i don't wanna be financially dependent on them either. they used to be pretty wealthy before the 2008 stock market crash since they both worked in real estate, but we've been dirt poor ever since (don't know much about the situation, it's mostly inferred; i was 6-7 at the time). they're already paying for half of my brother's college tuition which is going to be a LOT. especially since they already paid for 4 years of catholic school for him and 3 for me (i'm transferring out for my senior year, since the one i attended was single gender and that doesn't work too well with being trans))). In an ideal world, i would move out almost directly after graduation, but i'm going to graduate at 17, so i can't live on my own until like half a year after i'm done with HS (birthday is in november, you do the math). Would consider couch surfing until then, which would be pretty easy, i have a decent amount of friends and if worst comes to worst, there are a handful of abandoned places around town i can sleep that have decent unperishable foods and general necessities (leftover from before i came out, see: anxiety). Only downside to that is there's a likely chance she'll call the local police to find me and bring me home, as i won't be 18 yet, and i don't have the best relationship with the police here. Even if i couch surf, that's 6 months for the police to never see and recognise me. Also, won't have access to my meds or phone or anything since that's under them. i really really don't want to live there after i graduate but it seems like i have to

&amp;#x200B;

So moving out at graduation most likely won't be happening. can i move out when i turn 18? eh maybe. my two options are probably limited contact and cutting off. i know that my parents would NEVER understand why i want to do this. they are, as previously mentioned, completely unaware of the abuse i suffered; most of it wasn't on purpose or not directly involved with them. a sorry would NEVER cut it. i might be able to visit in the future, but i really can't stand living here for those extra months; i don't even know if i'm going to make it to graduation without going crazy. when i say cutting them off, i mean for a few years to get past all of this baggage and start a new life. i will probably see them again, though whether i will establish a permanent connection after that is up to future me. limited contact would be maybe talking to them once a month letting them know i'm ok. but because of the type of person i am, i know that would be horrible for me (i've been in kinda similar situations before, VERY long story). either way, i know keeping slight contact would suck for me, and it wouldn't do much to make my mother worry less. no matter which, she'll still worry and i don't think i should sacrifice my mental state to give her momentary relief (once again, even 30 minutes w/o contact and she goes crazy). i think that's all of it but i probably forgot a decent bit, the person that i am, so check if there's edits below

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr i'm 16, and growing up with undiagnosed mental illness and being LGBT caused me a lot of trauma that i want to escape ASAP, probably only once i turn 18. my mother freaks out if i don't talk to her every 30 minutes, so there's no way she could live talking to me even once a month, and i want to cut her off completely. there is no possible way she will ever understand why i want to do this, and will likely resent me for not being forward with it. what can i do, and is it worth taking constant reminders of trauma to momentarily satisfy her anxiety?**

(oh and i'm already posting r/advice and r/family, if you know any other subreddits that'll be welcome and will let me post with a throwaway, it would be greatly appreciated!)

&amp;#x200B;

edit: when i say that i don't know if i'll make it through HS i'm quite serious. my situation has gotten much much better in the last year but it's still practically unbearable. better now cos summer, but the added stresses of school and it being senior year won't be great. the only reason i made it through this year is sheer luck that i got very forgiving teachers who understood my situation and let me turn in essays and projects MONTHS late. oh and weed, i was high in class a decent bit. obviously it's cool recreationally but a few times i showed up to class incredibly stoned cos i just couldn't deal. nobody noticed, but once i skipped my first two periods because i was too high to attend, and pretended i had food poisoning. kinda unrelated to the weed thing but my anxiety is bad enough that i threw up a few times in the toilets. that will likely be better since i'm probably going to be on medication by the end of summer but the weed thing still should be addressed, anyone have a similar situation?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;quick warning this will be very very ramble-y and all over the place, i have no idea how to organise my thoughts (and it&amp;#39;s like midnight), though i will try my best. you probably wanna read the tl;dr instead, i just kinda needed a place to dump a lot of my thoughts and not all of this is super relevant to the situation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(oh and i&amp;#39;m already posting &lt;a href=""/r/advice""&gt;r/advice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""/r/family""&gt;r/family&lt;/a&gt;, if you know any other subreddits that&amp;#39;ll be welcome and will let me post with a throwaway, it would be greatly appreciated!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;edit: when i say that i don&amp;#39;t know if i&amp;#39;ll make it through HS i&amp;#39;m quite serious. my situation has gotten much much better in the last year but it&amp;#39;s still practically unbearable. better now cos summer, but the added stresses of school and it being senior year won&amp;#39;t be great. the only reason i made it through this year is sheer luck that i got very forgiving teachers who understood my situation and let me turn in essays and projects MONTHS late. oh and weed, i was high in class a decent bit. obviously it&amp;#39;s cool recreationally but a few times i showed up to class incredibly stoned cos i just couldn&amp;#39;t deal. nobody noticed, but once i skipped my first two periods because i was too high to attend, and pretended i had food poisoning. kinda unrelated to the weed thing but my anxiety is bad enough that i threw up a few times in the toilets. that will likely be better since i&amp;#39;m probably going to be on medication by the end of summer but the weed thing still should be addressed, anyone have a similar situation?&lt;/p&gt;

To this day, they prefer that they drive me to work and school rather than me learning how to drive or teaching me to drive.

I'm an emotional person and I've always kind of known that, but my parents aren't. They prefer to be 'rational' or 'wait things' out rather than taking action or addressing things. They kind of do this thing where they go about their life like everything is fine and then every few months they say some seriously dark shit especially my dad like, ""Well you know, your mom is nuts and she hates me, thinks I'm a failure as a man and a father, I might as well kill myself."" or my mom, ""Sometimes I fantasize about moving far away from everyone and becoming a hermit; not dealing with anyone or talking to anyone ever again. I've never been loved unconditionally by anyone. I was raised to think that I'm unimportant.""

Like I'm pretty sure they're depressed and I also feel bad cause I know they didn't have good childhoods, but most of the time they say shit more like, ""You should be positive, be careful with what you put in your mind."", ""Well if you think it's not going to work, then it won't work."", ""Discipline will set you free."", ""Don't dwell on it so much."", etc. This pattern of behavior has been going on for about 7 years now.

I feel like they're just really dismissive of me as well.

I'll do a lot of research on something and tell my mother about my findings and she'll just be like whatever about it and then a year or a few months later, she'll come to me with the same facts I've already presented to her as if she were telling me about this for the first time.

I feel too like they kind of project the identity they \*want\* me to have onto me cause for some odd reason, they're the only ones in my family that refer to me as white, while everyone else considers me to be mixed-race.

They act like they're the only ones that know who and how I really am too, even better than I know myself and if I disagree about something related to my own personality, they act like I'm just in denial.

This is going to take a while.

So, I was playing a game with my younger brothers and my youngest brother kicked me out the game for some reason. I went downstairs to ask him why and he accused me of stealing stuff in the game. I said no I didn't and he refused to let me re-join. I was like fine okay but my mum asked him to let me join. This is where my stepdad comes in.

My stepdad essentially says ""it's his game he can do whatever the fuck he wants."" I say that actually it's each of our game as we've spent time together working on it. He says that since I'm the older one and he's younger he should be able to do what he wants and that I need to grow up and stop playing games with my younger brothers. 

My mum stopped him and asked how that was fair and he shouted at her, then he started shouting at me. He has 4 stepkids and two of his own, one of them being the baby that my mum is currently pregnant with. I said to him that he always takes my little brothers side and that he bullies me and my other siblings. His response to this was ""Fuck off you're a cunt mate."" To which I also replied by calling him a cunt, because living with him for these past 8 years has been 99% bullying towards the kids that he ""took on."" I couldn't handle him talking to me like dirt so this is where I stand up for myself and my family.

My mum steps in and takes my side, he starts insulting me even more. I bring up the time he got in my face when I was 16 and threatened to beat me up, he responds by saying ""come on then what are you gonna do? What you gonna do?"" So he was basically challenging me to a fight ONCE AGAIN. I also brought up all the times he's made my mum cry and he refused to acknowledge any wrongdoing despite always threatening to run away and live with his mum so that my mum feels sorry for him. He likes to see himself as a hero and said that he rescued me from my previous abusive stepdad (despite him being almost exactly the same in terms of personality, and yes I told him that.) He also then kept portraying himself as the victim since I'd stood up to him and also kept telling me to fuck off. Bear in mind he's screaming at me and I can see the fury in his face. He said he's kicking me out and never wants to see my face again. This is all because I stood up to him and put him in his place. This isn't the end though.

I kept on calling him out on all of his bullying behaviour, he then on flapping his arms and making retard noises while I was speaking (I was diagnosed with Autism yesterday and he was blatantly making fun of me for it.) Even though his son is also being assessed for autism. Shows how much of a fuck he gives about other people. I called him immature and he responded by shouting at me again, I told him more about how he bullies me and my siblings and he responded with ""I don't give a fuck about your feelings."" To which I replied ""Yeah, because you're a narcissist and only care about yourself."" And finally, this is where he told me to fuck off and live with my dad and once again called me a cunt. So I'm leaving.

Its hard to capture all the contents of our arguments through text but... what should my next steps be? He's left the house to ""live with his mum"" but he's probably just parked around the corner messaging my mum and manipulating her as usual. This sort of behaviour coming from nearly a 40 year old man is unreal. He just can't handle being criticized by someone who he sees as beneath him. I've never gone this mental at him in the whole 8 years he's lived with us. He's never even been a dad to me, he's a stranger.

I have to try to diffuse situations, because she'd go off on tangents directed at strangers. Is she bi-polar, I don't know, but I know she is a definite NARCISSIST. And, now I'm going through some  but I have an ongoing dysfunctional relationship with her.

I don't have any other family, no kids and I'm divorced - all I have is elderly child (because she's older). I was estranged from her for 5+ years when I was married, because she was a raging belligerent alcoholic. I would often be mortified by her behavior. She'd go out, party and get drunk with her friends and leave me at home with my creepy step dad that started sexual abusing me by the time I was 12.

He sexually assaulted me by the age of 15 and I began running away from home. I tried to tell my mom in between her moments of sobriety when she wasn't trying to yell at me or fight with me. The more that I tried to tell her the more she was in denial and didn't believe me. It got to a point where I intentionally became promiscuous, so he would stop coming in my room at night or trying to get me to have sex with him.

She was NEVER there for me when I needed her, so I don't know why I ever thought her and I could have any type of decent relationship - that would entail her accepting her part of responsibility in the hurt that she caused. God forbid if a narcissist would EVER do that.  They don't fk'n care. I even tried to commit suicide twice, because the pain was too much to bare.

None of that ever woke her up. When I came back here and opted to try to have a relationship with her (that was the biggest mistake of my life); she put me in the worst situations of helping out my terminally-ill step dad by driving him to his dr's appointments. Even when I reminded her of his actions, she was in denial.

What she instilled in me during my formative years was to be a people pleaser, because in her mind - I was a bad child, because I'd run away and then because I started becoming promiscuous. She never looked at the root of the damage in how she was a belligerent alcoholic who was not there for me when I needed her most or that her husband sexually abused me - none of that even mattered to her.

I have ptsd, anxiety and rage. Every time she starts snapping off, I catch myself wanting to choke her azz out. She has always been lazy, by lazy I mean she can read, write and speak English, but it's not her first language, so there's a slight language barrier. My step dad enabled her by handling all of her communication - bills, finance/credit, etc. That was the worst thing he could have done, because she has NEVER wanted to expound on her knowledge. She's very low vibration as she has never aspired to evolve any further than whee she's at.

She's blatantly rude to me and to others. I've had to try to diffuse situations, because she'd go off on tangents directed at strangers. Is she bi-polar? I don't know, but I know she is a definite NARCISSIST. And, now I'm going through some health issues. I've mentioned it her, but everything with her, unless it's about her goes in one ear and out the other. Everything with her is about her and no one else. The worst thing that a person can do when someone mentions any issue is to make EVERYTHING about themselves.

I dropped out of school when I was coming up due to all of the turmoil. I was fortunate that I was able to secure good jobs with benefits when I was married and living in another state. After awhile I begin to go by my middle name, because I never really had time to think about it when I was coming up that I preferred my middle name in contrast to my first. I have it on all of my business cards, email, mail, etc. She refuses me to call me by my middle name, because she feel that I opted to go by my middle name to spite her. Also that by chance my dad gave me my middle name, but it has NOTHING to do with why I prefer my middle name over my first.

She assumes that the sun rises and sets in her azz. By that she'll make demands and assume that I should jump. The last time I completely annihilated a printer, because she was demanding that I drop everything and print out some documents that she didn't need right away until a few days later. She did it again last night where she was insisting that I go to DMV for her first thing Monday for a fk'n handicap placard that does not expire until December of 2019. Then she said she'd go, which she should, but she'a a lazy POS that is too lazy to breath on her own. I wish she'd drop dead then maybe I could try to pull the good memories and be able to be free. Every time she starts Has anyone ever been able to heal from their trauma bonds due to a narcissist parent?  What steps did you take?

I have to try to diffuse situations, because she&amp;#39;d go off on tangents directed at strangers. Is she bi-polar, I don&amp;#39;t know, but I know she is a definite NARCISSIST. And, now I&amp;#39;m going through some  but I have an ongoing dysfunctional relationship with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have any other family, no kids and I&amp;#39;m divorced - all I have is elderly child (because she&amp;#39;s older). I was estranged from her for 5+ years when I was married, because she was a raging belligerent alcoholic. I would often be mortified by her behavior. She&amp;#39;d go out, party and get drunk with her friends and leave me at home with my creepy step dad that started sexual abusing me by the time I was 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sexually assaulted me by the age of 15 and I began running away from home. I tried to tell my mom in between her moments of sobriety when she wasn&amp;#39;t trying to yell at me or fight with me. The more that I tried to tell her the more she was in denial and didn&amp;#39;t believe me. It got to a point where I intentionally became promiscuous, so he would stop coming in my room at night or trying to get me to have sex with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was NEVER there for me when I needed her, so I don&amp;#39;t know why I ever thought her and I could have any type of decent relationship - that would entail her accepting her part of responsibility in the hurt that she caused. God forbid if a narcissist would EVER do that.  They don&amp;#39;t fk&amp;#39;n care. I even tried to commit suicide twice, because the pain was too much to bare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of that ever woke her up. When I came back here and opted to try to have a relationship with her (that was the biggest mistake of my life); she put me in the worst situations of helping out my terminally-ill step dad by driving him to his dr&amp;#39;s appointments. Even when I reminded her of his actions, she was in denial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What she instilled in me during my formative years was to be a people pleaser, because in her mind - I was a bad child, because I&amp;#39;d run away and then because I started becoming promiscuous. She never looked at the root of the damage in how she was a belligerent alcoholic who was not there for me when I needed her most or that her husband sexually abused me - none of that even mattered to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have ptsd, anxiety and rage. Every time she starts snapping off, I catch myself wanting to choke her azz out. She has always been lazy, by lazy I mean she can read, write and speak English, but it&amp;#39;s not her first language, so there&amp;#39;s a slight language barrier. My step dad enabled her by handling all of her communication - bills, finance/credit, etc. That was the worst thing he could have done, because she has NEVER wanted to expound on her knowledge. She&amp;#39;s very low vibration as she has never aspired to evolve any further than whee she&amp;#39;s at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s blatantly rude to me and to others. I&amp;#39;ve had to try to diffuse situations, because she&amp;#39;d go off on tangents directed at strangers. Is she bi-polar? I don&amp;#39;t know, but I know she is a definite NARCISSIST. And, now I&amp;#39;m going through some health issues. I&amp;#39;ve mentioned it her, but everything with her, unless it&amp;#39;s about her goes in one ear and out the other. Everything with her is about her and no one else. The worst thing that a person can do when someone mentions any issue is to make EVERYTHING about themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

For some background, my brother is about 40 years old, and has had to declare bankruptcy twice already.  He's only a couple years out from the last bankruptcy so he can't declare again for a couple more years.  He is self employed, and makes a decent amount of money (probably around $90k-100k/year), but he spends his money like a manic.

&amp;#x200B;

As an example, he has an $80k truck.  He has a massive house he can't afford, and he bought his wife (who makes $10 / hour at her job) a Lexus SUV.  He let's his stepdaughter and her boyfriend rent out part of his house, which helps him pay the mortgage each month, but it comes at a huge cost.  She can't grow up and get away from her parents to make a life for herself, and he can't afford to have her leave because he depends on her to help with the mortgage.

&amp;#x200B;

He tries to justify his expensive truck as a write-offs for his business, but it's crazy.  The benefit he gets from the write off can't possibly come close to offsetting the payments he has to make each month, I also suspect that if he were to get audited, the IRS wouldn't be super happy about some of the write offs he's making.

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of the IRS... I'm writing this post because the last time I spoke with him he told me that he hadn't paid his taxes last April because he hadn't put aside any money for taxes!  Instead he filed for an extension.  What this means is that not only does he not have any money to pay the IRS for last year, but he probably hasn't set aside any money for this year either.  He is probably already behind $30k or so, which is a crippling amount of debt that can't be discharged.

&amp;#x200B;

His wife is also in debt.  She racked up some credit cards and didn't pay any of them.  Over the last year or so they have literally been hiding her from process servers who have tried to serve her.  Their strategy has been to hope that it will eventually go away because if they can't serve her with the court documents, the credit card company will have to drop their lawsuit.

&amp;#x200B;

Another detail.  I moved to a state that has very strict gun laws, and I couldn't take my guns so I asked my brother to keep them for me.  Now he has 3 of my guns in his home... I can't take them because they are illegal where I live so I'm thinking I need to find a way to sell them to get them out of his house.

My SIL slipped up and did cocaine once with her boyfriend while her 2 and 6 year old were asleep last year. She’s been struggling with alcoholism (getting drunk at least twice a week) while her kids are in her care and no sober adults present. 

She recently told me she started abusing Aderall which is a stimulant, like a “less potent speed” from what she described to me, for around 3  months. When her boyfriend found out he threw them out. She’s also stopping drinking now. 

So that’s good, she’s trying on her own to stop. Don’t think it’ll last long without professional help but I won’t tell her that, although I encourage her to get a counsellor when she talks about it. 

Then she messaged me and said she went for a long walk early this morning while her kids and husband were asleep at home. I’m not sure if she told her husband, but judging by how she parents, I doubt it. I don’t know how I feel about it. Her kids are 3 and 7. 

I don’t want to mess up her life but she seems to hide a lot from us and I want to be sure *they’re safe. Any suggestions on how I can help them or know if they’re safe or not? I’m hesitant to ask or talk to my in-laws too because of their addiction problems, they seem to defend her.

Today, she is better but she bitches a lot and is very rude to my parents at times. She makes horrible comments towards ppl sometimes like she hopes they die or call them mean things.

I feel bad for my mom because she just takes it while my sister bitches at her. Sometimes I think my mom feels that my sister doesn’t even like her because she’s asked me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always try to excuse her behavior since she has depression but I’m beginning to wonder if I shouldn’t and she is she just a nasty person. She lives in a different country now and I know it sounds bad but I’m relieved that she doesn’t live at home so I don’t have to deal with her temper tantrums that cause me anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I’m just conflicted because I feel like I shouldn’t abandon my sister but at the same time I feel like her behavior makes me unhappy and I hate reliving what I went through in the past. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it wrong to distance myself from her.? What would you do?&lt;/p&gt;

I'm 22 this year. My parents are 70 and 62 y/o.. they had me late. I am not sure if they had me out of love. They are not divorced (btw I think they didn't want to waste money or they are doing it for me). Either way, they are both cleaners earn very little income and spend it on daily necessity. They are not in speaking terms for as long as I can remember.  Although we stay in the same house but we never talk to my dad. I don't have a single happy moment with us together as a family. My mum practically raised me alone but I don't feel any love in this house. (maybe bc we are Asians and she doesn't show it) but I dreaded going home every day. Although my mum cares do care for me, she woke up early in the morning to prepare food before leaving to work (cleaner). I understand her life is difficult therefore now at age 22, studying in university, I decided to take up a part-time job as an insurance agent to earn some income as school is only 3/7 days in a week. But she was not supportive at all.  My goals ever since when I was 18 was to move out and stay on my own. But living in Hong Kong... is virtually impossible at such age houses here are crazily expensive.. there is no way I can do that.

(also part of the reason I wanted to get a job was so that I can stay out of the house for as long as possible)

I don't know... can someone tell me if I am not appreciative enough.. or is my family really screwed up... I have very little happy moments in this family although I know they provided for me..

I was told that the whole thing was none of the adult ""kids"" business, and that it had no impact on our lifes. This was said by my mother. I was further told that it didn't affect anyone but her (not even my father's mother who wasn't told until two days before his passing).  This is when I distanced myself from my parents while keeping tabs on what was going on with my sisters, and friends.  During the whole time we were told not to do anything or tell anyone and that we should ask or wait for us to be told to do things... (I however did notify family and close friends to arrange for support for my mother and father)  


We later found out (on the day of my fathers passing) that my parents apparently were aware of my fathers sickness and kept this from us and everyone else for more than 2-3 months meanwhile becoming argumentative and aggressive towards us.  


With all that going on us ""kids"" (except one) weren't told of any plans until we received invites to the celebration of life on.. fathersday.  I received that invite with an email from my mother asking how things would move forward between us and if i wanted to plan the event with her and one of my sisters.... (somewhat ridicolous as it was already planned) and if I wanted anything of my fathers clothing... (so not ready for that).   


I had been bruting over that email, for nearly a week and decided that I would have to drive up there and have a serious private conversation (calm especially, since my mother has the habit of blowing up at the littlest things... longest record so far has been 30 minutes)...   


So I did that today, record wasn't broken, unless we are talking speed record. First she tried to hug me as if nothing had happened, then we sat down and I tried to form my thoughts and sentences carefully...   


We are immigrants and while I have a good grasp on my mother tongue the way I talk is very clinical and precise (German) and while my english is fluent and it is easy for me to describe my thoughts, my mother doesn't have the patience or understands... Definitely a problem...   


Within 5 minutes I was told I was lecturing, that my sisters didn't suffer or weren't suffering, and that they were fine (I talk regularily with one while the other is withdrawing and know that they are falling apart). I was reminded that for me nothing changes, and that things only change for my mother, that this whole thing is a private matter, after a short interruption by a friend (urging my mother to calm down as she had been shouting) my at that point livid mother looked at her watch and asked how long this was going to take.  


I decided that I had my answer, I knew there was no family here, my mother maybe griefing but her cruelties towards my sister(s) and I as well as my fathers mother were unbelievable. There was no insight, no questioning, she wouldn't even listen or engage, I essentially ran into a wall of god knows what...   


When I left, I told her that she was a stranger to me from now on. It was hard but that person I saw, had no place in my life and if I should have children most definitely not in theirs...   


I have been feeling lost ever since immigrating, more so the older I got and realized that I was neither german or canadian, and now having lost the father who in essence was an authoritarian but also someone who kept the family together (in his weird ways), I have also lost my family because of a lie...

I (42m) was adopted as an infant in a closed adoption. I always knew I was an adopted child. My parents never were never shy about me having knowledge of it. They even said they would not be upset if I had interest in locating my biological family. I never had interest though, I had a loving family and I was satisfied. Later in life my wife at the time had asked me if I wanted to search for them. Still not interested. It was always a surprise to everyone that I didn’t have a care to uncover that history. I didn’t have any ill feelings against my biological family I was just satisfied with my life the way it was. 

How it happened...
About a year and a half ago, after I divorced, I had a girlfriend who was interested in ancestry. She had bought me an AncestryDNA kit for her own curiosity. I was always skeptical of these kits. I thought ok it will show my ethnic origins but that’s probably all. The results came back and it was what I had expected. Ethnic origins and a list of distant relatives. The distant relatives part I was still skeptical about. We are talking cousins five times removed, they could just be making this stuff up. Anyone could be a distant cousin like that. I just kind of left it there not expecting anything from it, again I wasn’t even interested in finding anyone so it didn’t bother me. 

Everything changed...
A few weeks ago I received a message through Facebook Messenger from someone saying we were connected on AncestryDNA as close family and she was wondering how we would be related. I sat on the message for a couple of days then figured I would write back that I have no history due to being an adopted child. She replied back that her sister had a son that was put up for adoption. I didn’t know how to feel. Could this be a real connection? She wanted to talk but I was hesitant at first. I told her I was really busy but I would get back to her soon. I put it off until this week. She asked me again if I was willing to talk and I decided what the heck. I told her I could talk on Thursday. When Thursday finally came around I made the call going into it without caring if I found out more information. I just didn’t want to be rude to someone that is maybe trying fill an emptiness in their life. We talked for a good hour and it turned out to be everything I never knew I wanted. 

I found out that I have two brothers and a sister. I found out that I have aunts, uncles and first cousins that even live near me. That was a shock to find out given I live 4 hours away from where I was born and grew up. I have since made connection with my younger sister. We are going to meet up in a couple weeks. I am so elated!! I also made connection with a first cousin that lives near me and we are also going to meet up. 

I did learn that my birth mother passed away 12 years ago. That news didn’t really bother me. I was more interested in the thought that I had siblings. I’m so excited now to meet up and start a relationship with this long lost family of mine. 

I do not have any information of my birth father’s family. That’s ok, I have enough to keep me busy for the time being anyway.

Another thing, I don't know if this belongs here or not because this was just something that was just funny and weird that happened. TLDR at the bottom.

Some context:
A couple years ago, both of my younger brothers (both still in elementary school at the time) somehow each broke a tooth around the same time (don't ask me how, I don't remember).  However, neither of them said anything until the older one (I'll call him Bro1) was in pain from his broken tooth having been rotted and turned green (why the youngest was not affected the same way is important for the story). Bro1's tooth was further in the back among his bottom molars while the younger's (Bro2) was out of sight but among his upper front teeth. Because both of our parents were busy, they couldn't take the boys to the dentist to get their teeth removed so me and my sister (we are both legal adults by this time and home from college) took them to their appointment as their guardians.  Obviously, the story will mainly focus on my youngest brother. 

Now onto the story:
Since both of them were at the age where their adult teeth were slowly coming in anyway, and it was of no consequence to have a bad baby tooth removed but it was standard for our dentist to x-ray our teeth at every appointment regardless.  Bro1's was not surprising after we found out about his broken tooth and the removal went as expected. Bro2's, however, threw everyone in for a loop as soon as his x-ray came in (why it never showed up in previous appointments still escapes me to this day).  Anyone who had ever looked into their own mouth in the mirror can obviously tell the difference between their crowned molars and their flat front teeth.  What we had assumed to be a broken front tooth (mostly due to the fact that the surrounding teeth were flat and the top of this particular tooth was jagged) turned out to be the crown of a molar.  Not only that, but the root of this tooth wasn't even attached to his skull, it was just a point that's halfway jammed between two adult front teeth that had not come out yet.  So there's me, my younger sister, the dentist, and his assistant staring at the computer screen in shock at the fact that Bro2 had an extra and useless molar that's growing in the wrong place.  After the initial shock I had, I let out a laugh that clearly says ""wtf is going on?""  I didn't watch his removal because I was with Bro1 in the waiting room but my sister did and she told me that the whole tooth (root and all) came out smoothly and in one piece. Obviously he's going to need braces when he's older, but for now, we came out of that office with a funny story to tell afterwards.

What is a healthy way to deal with her?

This is going to be a long post but the main issue is my mum won’t do anything to help herself and I don’t know how to help her.

About 2 years ago my dad left her for another woman and it destroyed my mum. Her reaction surprised me a lot as her and my dad hadn’t seemed to love each other in years, but she was devastated when he left. My dad was always the main earner in the family and my mum always did casual jobs on the side such as car cleaning, lunch bar assistant, retail salesperson.  In the last 5 years of their relationship my parents bought a failing business and because of that, when they sold their house they only had a small amount of money to split (I’m talking less than $5000) so they are both in their 50s and are pretty much starting life from scratch in every way possible. Even though they were together for 30 years my dad didn’t marry my mum, so she isn’t entitled to any of his superannuation.

This is where her behaviour is now getting really tricky for me to tolerate. 

She is going to need to get a rental property at some point but for now she’s getting away with staying at friends houses and looking after their pets when they are on holiday. It’s fine for now, but when she gets a rental I have no idea how she will afford it. She is on benefits but also has a casual job at a bakery that pays a low wage. She doesn’t make enough money to pay weekly rent anywhere, even if she gets a sharehouse her rent will be almost half of what she earns weekly. I’ve told her that she should go and do a TAFE course and get a certificate in bookkeeping or administration or maybe even aged care so that she can get a full time job that pays enough for her to survive. I keep telling her that because she is on benefits, she would get the course for less than half price. She keeps saying she will do a course but never does. Every time I ask her if she’s enquired she says ‘I can’t because I work at the bakery and I’ll lose hours’. I keep telling her that she shouldn’t prioritise a casual job where she might get 15hrs a week over a chance to work full time. I also tell her that the casual job is perfect while she studies as its flexible, and most the courses only go for 6 months....so in 6 months time she could be a qualified bookkeeper and have a completely new career, but 2 years later she’s still at the bloody bakery. I also ask her if she’s applied for other jobs. She has retail experience from the shop she owned so she could apply for full time sales positions at an electronics or furniture store, or even one of the big department stores like Target. She says she doesn’t want to because she used to own a store and she doesn’t want people to then see her working in a department store, she finds it humiliating. I can understand that, and am sorry that she feels that way, but her old customers see her working at the bakery all the time and it doesn’t seem to bother her. She also makes a point of rubbing it in every time I’m ‘wrong’. She will say something like ‘a customer came in to the bakery today and said they did a tafe course and still couldn’t find work. It’s the economy’. Now that she’s got the bakery job I can tell she’s going to be loyal to a fault, and not ever get another job despite not being able to survive on that wage.

So then I suggested another alternative and that was to go on the list for public housing. She says she doesn’t want to because ‘she won’t have a choice in where she lives’. I feel like no choice is better than homelessness. The waiting list for public housing is a few years long, but here we are again and 2 years later she’s still not on the list.

Despite all my suggestions, she complains daily about having no money and not being able to afford anything.

This brings me to the next area of complete frustration and fear for me and that is her health. When We were kids, there was always a dinner on the table. But now that her kids have grown up and moved out her diet consists of potato chips and eggs on toast. My dad said she was like this before she had kids. She’s seriously underweight so her weight is not the issue, the issue is she’s getting ZERO nutrition from eating a packet of chips for dinner. Almost 10 years ago she had bowel cancer. She had to have her bowel removed and now has a ‘bag’. But she still hasn’t changed her diet. She overcame cancer just to continue eating potato chips and toast. Now that she’s got the bag her diet is restricted. She can’t have any vegetables with the skin on, she also can’t have meats with skin like sausages or salami, and she can’t have anything spicy. So of course now when I try and get her to eat healthy she’ll say ‘I can’t eat it’ or ‘I’m not allowed to eat that anymore’. The reality is she CAN eat it, just a modified version eg. Peeling her vegetables before cooking them. I’ve also suggested juicing fruits and vegetables as a way to get the nutrients in, but she’ll still say that she can’t. Even though the juicer removes all the fruit and vegetable and you are literally left with just the juice...nothing can get stuck. She drinks about 7 coffees a day, so I don’t understand why she can drink coffee but she can’t drink vegetable juice.

Now comes the worst part....despite having cancer and her bowel removed and having her life completely changed forever...she STILL smokes. She has smoked since she was 16 and I’ve tried everything to get her to quit. She smoked through 2 pregnancies despite having complications with the first one. She’s told me that ‘back then they didn’t tell you not to smoke when pregnant’ even though I think that’s BS as they have known smoking harms babies for years. Then when she got sick I thought it would scare her enough into quitting but at the time she was saying ‘I’ll quit after treatment’. Then when my dad left it was ‘I’m too stressed right now I have too much going on’. I’ve been telling her she needs help from a doctor to quit as obviously it’s too hard to do by herself. Again, 2 years on and nothing’s been done, no appointment has been made. She saw the same doctor for 35 years and he recently passed away. Now when I ask her about seeing a doctor to quit smoking she says ‘I can’t because my doctor died’. I tell her there are other doctors and she says ‘yeah but it’s not the same’. I tell her that she had 35yrs to see her last doctor about quitting smoking and she never did, so she will have to find a new doctor. That was a month ago, still no appointment. 

I’ve suggested many times in the past that she see a therapist. But she says she’s ‘sceptical’ because they will ‘make her think things happened to her that didn’t’. Whatever that means.

This is where her issues are getting more personal to me and have significantly damaged my life. About 6 months ago I was diagnosed with adult adhd after a lifetime of struggling with ‘depression and anxiety’. After doing the research, it’s hugely genetic (I get it from my dad - undiagnosed) but the other major factor is maternal smoking. It increases your risk by 40%. There’s a chance I would have got it anyway, but she really didn’t do me any favours. Her and my nanna used to joke about me having ADD when I was little but they never thought to take me and get me assessed. Instead my parents berated me for being a certain way. I’m nearly 30 so this has damaged me in so many ways. I’m currently single while I finally get this disorder under control, meaning I have no support system when dealing with my dysfunctional family. I have a brother and a dad who I don’t speak to.

It frustrates me that despite having ADD which impairs your ability to function as an adult, I still cope better than my mum. I feel like I’m her parent. Apart from this, she’s a loveable person and all her friends adore her, so when I get frustrated at my mum everyone thinks I’m a horrible daughter that treats my mum badly. My mother of course loves to play the victim, make excuses and get all her friends on her side. I just don’t know what to do. They aren’t the ones that are going to have to pay for her cancer treatment if she gets sick again. I know I’m the one that will have to be her carer when she gets ill. It’s not if, it’s when with my mum, and next time she gets diagnosed with cancer it will be terminal. I’m tired of all the suffering she has caused me and people don’t understand that because she’s ‘nice’.

Basically my question is what do I do from here?  Everything I’ve been through in life has been completely preventable. I’m sick of suffering and going through crisis after crisis with my family. I’ve never had anything good happen to me. I’ve been through years of therapy and now that my adhd has been diagnosed I’m improving in strides. I want to make some joyful things happen for me, I want a wedding, honeymoon and baby. I also want to go back to uni and study psychology. The healthier I get, the more problematic my mums behaviour looking to me and I’m at the point where I feel like I have to choose between her or a healthy life. I feel like a healthy life can’t happen with her in the picture, but obviously I love her so I don’t want to have to cut contact. Help!

I’m tired of all the suffering she has caused me and people don’t understand that because she’s ‘nice’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically my question is what do I do from here?  Everything I’ve been through in life has been completely preventable. I’m sick of suffering and going through crisis after crisis with my family. I’ve never had anything good happen to me. I’ve been through years of therapy and now that my adhd has been diagnosed I’m improving in strides. I want to make some joyful things happen for me, I want a wedding, honeymoon and baby. I also want to go back to uni and study psychology. The healthier I get, the more problematic my mums behaviour looking to me and I’m at the point where I feel like I have to choose between her or a healthy life. I feel like a healthy life can’t happen with her in the picture, but obviously I love her so I don’t want to have to cut contact. Help!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR my mum does nothing to help herself, I don’t know how to help her and she is causing me huge amounts of suffering&lt;/p&gt;

I was confused, i didn't know why he got something about child support but i was thinking it might've been something else (i dont know what, I was trying to come up with other solutions). My sister came into the room and i showed her my dad's mail and she started panicking and put the letter in my dad's room.

I was immediately suspicous, and i asked her what that was about. She made me swear to keep it a secret from basically everyone i knew (i dont know you guys and i really need to talk about this). I asked her to just tell me and she told me that my dad cheated on my mom when my sister was one and he ended up having another son. 

Im shocked and angry, shocked that my dad cheated and had a son, and angry that he cheated on my mom and never said anything about it. But then my sister tells me that she found out from my mom WHO KNEW.

I'm 30 and married; would my stepfather still be able to legally adopt me?

My mother and stepfather have been married close to 20 years now. My stepfather has been there for me through pretty much everything. I refer to him as Dad.

Before I turned 18 I had considered asking him to adopt me, but I figured that my biological father would not allow it even though he lives on the west coast and we have absolutely no relationship. So I didn't bother trying.

I do not consider my biological father to be anything to me other than DNA, and I feel that my stepfather should have the legal right to call me his daughter (even though he already calls me his daughter anyway).

Anyway. I'm not sure if it's too late to do this. It would just mean a lot to me. We're in Pennsylvania, if that's any help.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel like this might be a strange question to ask, but here goes.&lt;/p&gt;

My mom passed away Tuesday. It wasn't unexpected, but I'm still raw with emotion. I'm the youngest (F55) with four siblings (S/63, S/62, B/60, B/58). Oldest sister and younger of brothers live in two different states. Younger of sisters and oldest brother live in same town as my mom. I live in the state where I grew up. Mom moved from here 10 years ago after dad passed, to live nearer brother and sister.

We aren't a close family. I did not expect that to magically change when mom passed. But how I see my family now makes me glad I don't have to see them. My oldest sister thinks that talking to my mom every day gives her decision making authority and the right to criticize how my bother (PoA) and my other brother managed mom's care and estate. The last time she went to the town where my mom lives, she managed to eke out 20 minutes of a five-day stay to visit my mom. My daughters were there at the same time and spent upwards of eight hours each day with their grandma, so they know how much time my sister was there. Her own daughter, also visiting, never went by. My other sister took the dog to visit my mom every day. That was a huge sacrifice of time and was surprising and heartwarming to find out. They had a terrible relationship until my mom lost her memory. That is a memory Mom didn't lose. She could not remember every day that sister had been there only hours before. She didn't have much good to say about my sister, but I never said that to anyone. My brother from out of state flew in often to see mom and help other brother. My older brother praises younger one highly.

I had a strained relationship with my mom but I made sure my girls spent a ton of time with her as they were growing up, and that they went to visit her when she moved. She loved them so much and made no secret to me that they were her favorites of the five she had. After my dad died, mom and I didn't talk for nearly eight years. I went to visit her in 2017 and felt a heavy weight lift. We did not become suddenly close but it was ***better***. I visited again in 2018 when she started to decline. For four days I spent hours and hours with her, just imprinting her on my mind. After that, we still didn't talk much but I kept up with her progress from my brothers.

Just days before she passed, older sister called me to seriously complain about my brother and how he was handling my mom's care. Literally half of her information was given to her thru my other sister who was told things by *patients in the memory care center*. These people sometimes can't remember to go to a toilet or eat, but we must believe their memories of my brother and mother are 100%. My brother didn't like my sister to talk about my mom's care in front of her (the parts where we were preparing for her death). My oldest sister thought that was horrible! I felt like they could be respectful of his feelings. That made me the asshole.

I wanted to put an obit in our local paper to be present for the hundreds of friends she has in town. I know how busy my brother is so I wrote it myself and shared it with him from memory. He said it sounded good, so I ran it and sent them all the link. Well, come to find out my mom has a sister that I didn't know was her sister. I thought she was a ""loving family member,"" since she really is my aunt's sister that my grandma raised. And I also didn't include in the obit that my mom loved her dog. So instead of a quick thanks for taking care of this, there is a rebuke and a directive that the obit my brother runs needs to include that info. I did not see any of them offer to write or help.

Everyone feels grief in their own way. Mine is that I wished I'd been a better daughter, and that I'd had a different set of sisters.

I come to ask for your advice about my relationship with my stepfather. The thing is that I have had a conflicted relationship with him from day 1 because he can be emotionally abusive: he's the kind of person to criticize absolutely everything about you in very rude ways. Just to share a few examples, he told me when I was 12 that I am useless and that my only positive trait is that I had good grades at school; when I was about 14, he told me he loved my mom more than I do because he could buy her things while I didn't (for God's sake, I was only about 14 or 15!), he has told more than once that I'm a failure (and trust me, I'm not the kind of person who doesn't do anythind in life or something like that), etc. I have to admit not everything has been bad; he has done other good things and actually cares for me, but I feel like his constant and rough criticism can become an emotional abuse. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I've had a lot of patience all these years (he started living with my mom and I about 14 years ago and I'm 24 now) because of my mom. We even had once an exchange of words so strong that he spent that night somewhere else and I had to call him to come back. And I have put up with this just because I know someday I'll have to get out of my home and I don't want my mom to be alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

But this situation has become more and more toxic everyday, especially since a year and half ago. The thing is that we now spend much time inside the house because I work from home and he retired from his job, and I feel constantly deppressed at my own place. And honestly, I feel that even though he's not the worst man on planet earth, he sometimes behaves kind of shitty with my mom too, and I hate it (she herselfs knows that and she has actually thought of breaking up). In fact, one of the things that I hate the most about all of this is that we're facing a very tough economic crisis (I'm from Venezuela) and he litterally spends the WHOLE DAY watching TV or looking at his phone. I understand, the crisis is tough, finding a job is difficult, but I've seen a lot of people making an effort to get over the crisis and at least try to earn a little bit of money, but he doesn't. And that gives me a lot of pressure because I have to work extra hours and even had to drop college cuz, if it wasn't for my job, we would be litterally starving. I just feel like being at home is incredibly depressing and the only reason why I haven't moved is because I seriously don't have the money to pay for a rent in Caracas.

&amp;#x200B;

So everything exploded tonight; we had a huge fight, I told him everything I resented, everything I feel, and he said he wants to move. And I don't know how to feel. One part of me wants him to leave. At least my life would be a bit easier without his presence at home and maybe my mom could find a better man. But what if she doesn't? What if she stays alone? I don't know how to feel. I don't know if I'm being selfish (although I tried to reason with him and make him understand he has to improve his attitude or we're not going anyhere, and even told him I was willing to try to pay a family therapist, but he just plays the victim's card saying ""everything I do is wrong for you"", even when I pointed out he has done good things too and that I make mistakes as well, with the difference that I always work on improving myself while he never acknowledges he's wrong in the first place). I'm in a point where I feel that my mental health is in sake. I don't know if I should have more patience and just keep on with this depressing home life for my mom until I'm finally able to move somewhere else or if I should think for once about my own well-being. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know and I feel lost.

I remember that when I was maybe 5 years old I would of course come to hug my mom when I was upset. But I can't remember any time since I was 5 that I actually hugged or touched my parents, or any of my siblings. I didn't get praised for my good grades as a kid, I only got disappointment when I didn't do something perfectly right. I wasn't allowed to stay home from school when I was sick, unless the teachers said so. I was never asked how my days were. I wasn't asked about my friends. I wasn't asked for my opinion on things.

I don't know why or when but at some point I just stopped trying to interact with my family. And it didn't change anything. In my teenage years I found friends that helped me develop mentally and socially instead. I stopped going to church and would consider myself agnostic now. I developed a rather dark sense of humor. I'm sexually open and accepting of anybody. My parents are both quite homophobic, and even though I'm straight, it makes me feel even less comfortable talking to them about stuff. Actually, I'm uncomfortable talking to them about anything.

Now, I thought it was normal that you just can't be yourself around your parents. They are from a different generation, they have different world views, they know everything better anyways. Up until I met my boyfriends family. He's one year older than me, but his parents are only in their early fourties, which makes them the same age as my oldest brother and my parents the age of his grandparents.

I was baffled by their positivity. They talk to each other when eating dinner together. My boyfriend is the same person with them as he is with me. They make jokes, they laugh with each other. They ask about each others day and are very involved in each other's lives. They talk about practically anything with each other, apart from their personal sex lives. To me they don't feel like parents. I view them as friends who just happen to be 20 years older than me. I know it can be toxic for kids when their parents act like their best friends and don't restrict them anything. But they somehow made it work. All three of their kids are amazing people. (of course I don't know if they were different while their kids were growing up though).

I don't know what I'm actually trying to reach by posting this. Here I am, faced with two completely different ""types"" of families, maybe even opposite. And I don't know if my family is an extreme or if theirs is an extreme. I guess I'm just wondering if their family is ""normal"" and mine is not. Or if my family is ""normal"" and theirs is not. Or are they both perfectly normal and just different? Is either of them healthy? 

I'm just confused.

&lt;p&gt;My mum is extremely pissed off with him as he never takes any responsibility and thinks it’s ok to talk to her and me like that, she says she doesn’t like him at all anymore and that the house and my little brother are the only reason she’s still there, now today they have been texting back and forth arguing and his saying a complete different story than what actually happened, my Mum told him that his confused and doesn’t know what his talking about and his reply was “I wish I was dead”, Mum really wants to leave him but I’ve told her to just talk to him and stick it out as I do not want my little brother having to go through all the break up shit at the same age I did. &lt;/p&gt;

A few months ago, my father threatened my mother with social workers if she refused to get me vaccinated. \[I'm not an anti-vaxxer, my mother is. And we've grown up on horror stories of kids who were drugged, beaten, or otherwise abused in the foster care system, I panicked.\]  I think this is what radically shifted my views on my father, as this was a direct threat to me.

Cue us fighting in the texts, most of mine essentially being ""I don't want to go, I'm sorry but I don't."" During this, I swapped from sitting on my bed, to trying to get my mom to take the phone and text him, before finally just curling up in the bathroom and sobbing when he told me how he understood how I never wanted to go or see him and offering to write a letter to his lawyers about how I wouldn't see him for visits anymore AT ALL.

I don't want that. He's my father, he's the man who raised me. I love him and always will, no matter what he does to me. I just want a choice on what weekends I go. But I don't know what to do, I feel like he hates me for this and it's destroying my relationship with him, even writing this is making me cry. What do I do?

She's my twin sister but we've pretty much hated each other since middle school. We were both chunky kids and were bullied because of that. Instead of sticking together she started bullying me in front of others. I'm guessing to deflect bullies from her onto me. When we got to high school it was about the same. I told my sister I felt like killing myself and the next day at school, her bff told me different ways to try killing myself to ensure I'd die. It was too much, I did try to kill myself (not by any of her suggestions cause fuck her, right). Anyways day 2 in the psch ward the therapist thought it would be good to bring my sister in. Literally the first thing my sister says is I wish she'd actually died. 

Skip ahead two years later, I lost 35lbs so I wasn't bullied by anyone other than my sister. My still low self esteem self dated an asshole got pregnant and that guy left. She watched my daughter during the day while I was at cosmetology school. I found out she would take my daughter to our mutual friends and tell everyone that my daughter preferred her over me and I was a terrible mother. When I confronted her it turned physical like all of our fights since childhood. She called the police and I was arrested but eventually everything was dropped but in the mean time she called DCF to try and have my daughter taken from me. DCF found no reason to do that so again everything was dropped. I didn't talk to her for 8 months after that. But she was hit by a car and I was the first call she made at the hospital. Scared, covered in blood with half her leg just shredded, reaching for me asking for help. So we got over that last round of BS then and was fine afterwards. 

So yea we've had our fair share of shittyness. Lots of fights and periods where we wouldn't talk. But the last bit really did it in for me. 3 years ago my bipolar was really bad. I was in a manic state that lasted 6 months. I tried to kill myself by making a noose. Stepped off a table and got back on after a few seconds of ""oh shit I shouldn't be doing this"" . After being hospitalized for the first time and hopefully my last time as an adult she came to visit and help out. During that visit she asked if she could have my valve vr set. Back then those were close to $400. I told her we could trade that for her like 2 generation old iphone (i didn't have a smartphone and wanted one) 

Fast forward 2 months she text me demanding $350 cause she had to replace a $35 part of the vr and if she knew she had to do this extra work she wouldn't have made the trade in the first place. I offered to split up the payment, $125 then $125 in two weeks. No dice. So then she sends a wall of text of how I shouldn't have gotten back on the table and just died. My bipolar will ruin my children who don't love me anyway. 

So I blocked her and 8 months after that she got a hold of me with her new number asking if my 8 year old would call her. I asked if she was going to apologize for everything she said  and she said she wouldn't. I told her I wouldn't let a stranger say all of those hurtful things and then have a conversation with my daughter so, no I  wouldn't let her talk to my daughter.  Again I'm instantly bombarded with how my kids hate me etc etc.

It's been over a year since then. I miss having a sister. Even though she said all of that hurtful stuff there were times she was my only friend. My mom recently had a cancer scare and I wanted to talk to my sister so badly but didn't. Do I ask her for another apology? Do I  apologize?

I'll put it on speaker and let the guy speak and listen while my dad is talking to her.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if this a good idea, it just happened now and we have yet to execute the plan.

I honestly don't know if this is a good plan, I need some of your thoughts and opinion quick.

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first time ever posting in reddit.

I honestly don't know how to feel around her, I pretended to have a strong connection like I actually before but now i just don't feel like it. I lost the original feeling, towards her.

This happened once, my dad went overseas and she went out with a guy which she inevitably had a baby with, which I was there. Me being a child, I remain clueless. Now that I'm very matured and rationalized, I now see the bigger picture.

I'm actually hoping its a friend but she remained distant. The number area code is in the city that we live in or live next to. So he probably met someone and started to hang out.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know. If this came out true, then we will have to move back to the city we used to live. Everybody is back there, friends, family, even hour 2 story house. She might not come with us and take our little sister which that isn't my dad. She will be living with the guy she been talking to and Me, My sister, will go back to the original city with him. We are picking my dad because he tried this best to support the family. He would always cook food, buy groceries, picked my little sister up when he can, cleaned the house, everything that he can support not only us, to lay easy on my mom. Yet that effort wasn't so great.

&amp;#x200B;

So I don't know. They got married 1.5 Year ago and already she is going out with another man. She promised it will never happen again but she broke the promise. Im heartbroken but it is what it is.

I’m under a lot of stress right now and I’m really not sure what I should do. Thank you for reading, I really need your advice. And it’s also not like I’m a bad person. My parents hear from other people all the time how I’m respectful and all that and I get As in school and 1 or 2 Bs. I’m not sure why they are acting the way they do and I’m concerned for my mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

They've been married nearly 10 years. They are both incredibly kind people and we've never had any kind of problems between us. When I was very young, mom met and married the father of my younger brother. Things didn't work out between them and they divorced when I was 11 years old (step-dad was abusive towards me but not his own son).

Dad lives on the west coast 17 hours away by car. Dad was absent for most of my life, we reconnected in 2007 and I flew out there to live with him for a year in 2008 - 2009. My spouse and I last flew out to visit him in May 2015.

In 2012 I loved from my home city to this one where I met my spouse. We married in December 2015. I invited my Mom and her husband but they didn't show up - I was only told later it's because they were too sick to travel. I invited dad and said I didn't expect him to be there given the distance but didn't want him to feel like he wasn't welcome - he apologised that he wouldn't be able to make it and that was fine with me.

So I married my spouse in a small ceremony with his parents and some of his friends. No one from ""my side"" showed up or could make it.

My younger brother married in 2016. No expenses were spared. Big, expensive wedding a resort a few hours away from where my spouse and I live, which makes it a 5+ hour drive by mom and her husband.

Back in February of this year, mom and her husband and my younger brother and his wife (and their kids) drive down to Arizona for a multi-week holiday. I don't regret that my spouse and I weren't invited - we would have declined even if we were because we wouldn't have been able to afford it.

In the years that I've lived here, mom and her husband have repeatedly said they intend to come here to visit. We have made plans several times and they just never show up. Their reasons are always they were too busy or tired. This past May long weekend they were going to come up to be here for my birthday and I had saved up a few hundred dollars so I could take them to a nice restaurant.

Predictably they didn't show up. I decided to just ignore it this time because this just keeps happening.

Because of geographical distance, my dad and I used to keep in touch regularly over Skype. A couple years ago he met a wonderful woman who is now his girlfriend and I am thrilled he finally has someone kind and fun and giving to be my dad's partner. I understood when our Skype calls grew infrequent - I was happy he was having an amazing time with this wonderful woman.

The last time dad and I talked over Skype was in March and it was only because I relentlessly pestered him about it for three months. His first comment that preceeded him agreeing was ""yeeesh!"" We had a very nice chat ... and I knew it would probably be our last.

I feel like I'm the only one making an effort to reach out, to try to make things happen, to carry on having a relationship with my parents. Their actions tell me they're just not into this and I get it. People grow apart and fall away. It just kinda sucks. 

I can't force them to have a relationship with me, and I don't want that at all. So I decided to let it go. I'm open to contact if they initiate it, but I'm not going to be the one reaching out anymore. Whatever their reasons, there's not much I can do here.

They know how I feel because I've told them I miss them, I wish we'd talk more, I wish we would visit each other. I have made plans to see them in person or at least talk over Skype. I haven't left them to ""guess"" at this or to ""figure it out"" - I've been straight-forward and clear about how I feel and what my thoughts are.

But in the end it's up to them if they want to have a relationship with me and their actions (or lack thereof) tells me: *no.*

I feel like I've lost my parents and it really sucks because it wasn't by accident, it's by choice on their part.

So I feel like I'm grieving.

So back in the day, my father cheated on my stepmother with my biological mom. My mom got pregnant with me and my twin brother. Because of this, I believe my stepmom harbors some deep rooted dislike for me and my twin; simply because we’re a reflection of our dad’s infidelity. My stepmom and my dad do have other kids together, and I feel like she does show favoritism towards them because they’re actually hers.  The favoritism part is not the only reason why I don’t like her, but the way she acts as well.  She really has this Jekyll &amp; Hyde personality. This doesn’t just happen to me but almost anyone that shes’s around. For awhile, she can be a very sweet lady (the one I love and love to be around) but the other side of her is just plain C R A Z Y. She’ll have these mood swings where one minute she’s nice and then she’ll flip out over the STUPIDEST things. I have so many instances where this has happened but here’s a few; she got mad at me because I told her i was in the bathroom before she went out with the family (she texted me and assumed I thought she was crazy, which was never a thought in my mind and that was totally out of nowhere). She’s even accused me of doing things I didn’t do, majority of them are silly and she’ll stay mad at me for some time. She tries to correct people when it isn’t needed. She has this tone of voice when she gets irritated with what people do and say (nothing worth the attitude). She’s VERY snappy and has these crazy ass mood swings. She’s good at slamming things around/shutting doors when she’s mad. When she thinks you’ve done something and you try to explain to her, she ignores you: like wtf. She often hurts ppls feelings with the way she acts, but when she does it we can’t call her out on it because she’ll get pissed even more; but if we do it, she gets angry and storms and will hold it against you like we’re in the wrong. Again, all of her actions just doesn’t pertain to me, it’s happened to my dad and brother; I haven’t really seen it happen with my sister (which is actually my half sister; she’s my stepmother’s biological daughter) or her other children. I currently live with my dad and stepmom, and it’s honestly been so stressful because of her. My dad and I literally have to walk on eggshells just to not get her upset. I’m often in my room a lot so I won’t have to be around her for most of the day. I honestly think if I wasn’t here she’d be happier. I’m 25 and I live with them so I can build up my credit and to move out on my own. Sometimes I feel like I can’t do it because she’s bad energy for me. The last thing  I should worry about getting off from work or anywhere is to come home and deal with someone who’s emotionally draining and hard to be around. I also feel like there’s a wedge in me and my dad’s relationship. We’re not as close as we use to be before she moved in with us 4 or 5 years ago. I sense that she’s jealous when I spend time with my dad. I think she’s aware that I would much rather spend time with my dad than her; which is why I’ve kinda distance myself from them, more so my stepmom. My dad says and does things to appease her in hopes not getting her upset, which is another thing that’s bothersome for me. I’ve told him before that he needs to stand up to her. He does sometimes but not as good as he could. I also think my stepmom does have some abandonment issues, her mother left her when she was young. So with my dad’s infidelity and the abandonment, I feel like it’s why she acts the way she does. But by no means this should not be an excuse for her to act the way she does; my dad sort uses that as a reason to somewhat excuse her behavior. I DON’T AGREE WITH IT AT ALL. I won’t allow her childhood to be an excuse for her to treat ppl the way she does at times. She’s in her late 60’s and it’s been overdue for her to move past it and take responsibility for her actions and not to blame it on others. I’ve been very welcoming to her since she’s moved down here to spend time with her let her become a mother figure, but b/c of her craziness I honestly say To Hell With It. She mentions that we need to be close but how can I when does all of these things and when I think she doesn’t like me. What are your thoughts on this situation?

Due to our own personal reasons, we still live with our parents. 

The Closet: lived in this house for 12-13 years. My brother got the smaller of the two bedrooms upstairs. (About 8x10) whereas I got the larger (About 12x15). The reasoning for this was made by my parents. I believe it was due to the fact that my brother was reaching puberty soon and would need the privacy. Since I had the biggest room, I had the largest closet (About 3x15) that ran the length of my room. Brother had a closet that was outside of his room that was barely (2x3). So I completely understand that he’d need to use my massive closet to store his toys. 

The Problem: As kids can be, we were lazy as we cleaned our room. We’d simply shove things into my closet and close the doors and everything was “clean.” At a certain age, I realized what the consequences were of that and tried to clean it myself. I barely created a dent. So instead of adding to the problem, I simply kept the items I used in my room and taped my closet doors shut. My brother is a HUGE pack rat and doesn’t give a flying f*** about how I may want things. So, he continued to buy stuff, wreck the inside of my closet, and stack things until it got out of hand. Recently, every time I’ve opened the doors, I’ve had something fall on me (the mess was up to my shoulders at least). So, fed up, I tore everything out of there and sorted through it.

I can’t just throw away his stuff, he’s warned me not to multiple times (when I’d beg him to help me clean it) so I stacked all of his things into a pile I labeled as “maybe.” He bitched and moaned as he went through it. Got rid of a hand full of items and proceeded to dick around with the rest of them. Destroyed my pile, wasted my time, and crushed my hopes of an organized closet. 

So now I’m fuming because I spent the past 2 FULL days cleaning that damn closet, and it’ll be restocked with all of his shit and basically none of mine.

She wants to call the cops on him at work to show his coworkers what he actually did to her and most likely get him fired. She told me to keep a secret from him.

I find it hard to believe he hit her, he’s a stern guy yes, but he never gets physical, he’s just a yeller. 

She wants me to keep it a secret that she’s calling the cops and i don’t know what to do.

Please guys, i really need help, i might make a follow up post if we need more info.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry, I’m on mobile formatting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a huge fight between my dad, sister, and mom. Mom was angry at my sister and my sister was equally pissed at her. My dad is playing the middle man and tryin to diffuse the argument. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things escalate and mom threatens to hit sister. Yelling match ensues, my father snaps and yells at mom. &lt;/p&gt;

My name is Amnee Elkhalid and I am a researcher in the Communication Studies Department at the University of Missouri. I am conducting a study on narratives told by children from interfaith marriages and could really use your help. Stories help shape what and how we think, as well as the ways we talk about our identity and interactions with others. In this study, stories can help us understand children's identity formation and religious differences. I am still looking for participants and would love to hear from you! 

If you or someone you know is 18 years or older and has parents with two different religious beliefs or orientations (ex. Protestant, Catholic, Mormon, Muslim, Jewish, Atheist, etc.); I would love to have a conversation! Interviews would allow me an opportunity to hear stories about an individual’s experiences with parents from different religious orientations and the individual’s personal religious belief. The interview will last ½ to 1 hour depending on how much the interviewee wants to share. Confidentiality is important and your answers will ***not*** be connected to your identity. The interviewee can also choose not to answer any question and can end the interview at any time.

My mum (46f) and I (19f) had a fight, over her feeling as if I don’t do anything around the house to help (when I do try my best), that she feels like a ‘maid’ and she’d wish she could die because she’s so done with feeling like that. I’ve apologised so many times over the first day and two, crying (sorry, I’m just so emotionally unstable right now), but she just barely acknowledges me. 

I absolutely love my mum, and having her barely talk to me since is killing me. She’s distanced herself from me, and makes it clear to everyone else in my family how much she loves them. We haven’t spoken all day and have avoided each other - I still live with my parents but I’ve been hiding out in my room all day today. 

I’ve literally been crying countless number of times per day these last few days, having my mum act as if she doesn’t care about me hurts me so much. At first I was hurt, but now I’m just angry at her for making me feel like this, and vow to myself to never act this way towards my kids if I have any in the future, to make them feel so unloved. I’m especially mad about how she’ll talk about how she’s rather die than continue on like this, and that right there is one of my biggest fears.

I’m someone who can’t help but constantly worry about my family, messaging every few hours to see how they are. I’m not scared of death but more so the fact of them leaving me. I’m so paranoid that something bad will happen all the time, I couldn’t imagine how I’d cope if someone close to me died (even though I know we’ll all die one day). And my mum saying this stuff breaks me heart. Honestly, I think of how much life would be easier for her if I were to die - I can’t help it. 

I posted here a few days ago about telling them that I’ve had a boyfriend for the past two years, and how I was scared to break it to my parents - well that’s not going to happen anytime soon. My mum already pretty much hates me. Idk what to do anymore. I know it’s only been a few days, but I really feel that this time, my mum has just ... like ‘let go’ of me.

I scan my memories for happy bits with you because I don’t remember any. I remember you always angry, always frowning, always shouting. 
Disappointment painted all over your face. I don’t remember you ever playing with us as children. I don’t remember you being warm to us when we were kids. You are a ball of negativity. I remember you telling us how envious you are of other parents because we are not their kids. 

I think you never wanted a family. You never wanted kids. We took your freedom away from you. You were never happy. I never saw you happy. You were just always tired. And angry. Of cleaning up after us. Of feeding us. Of teaching us. Of raising us. You never wanted us. Or at least me. You never wanted me. You never made me feel you wanted me. And so my heart started to drift away from you. Slowly... drifting..

In grade school I was always part of the top 10 kids. But one time, I don’t even remember what I did.. But I clearly remember what you said and it stuck to me, until now. You told me, “What kind of grade is this? It’s embarassing that you are even part of the top 10.” And so I never wanted to be in the top 10 anymore. 

I don’t remember you talking softly to me. Or giving sound advise to me. Your face, I remember, is already frowning when I start opening my mouth. You were always so critical. Of every single thing I did. You never let me do anything by myself. Coz when I started doing things my way, you didn’t want it. You always wanted things done your way. But Mom, your way isn’t the only way. We are our own person. It doesn’t mean we’re doing things wrong. 

Growing up, I always felt alone. I grew up an introvert. My face always buried in fiction - comics and paperbacks alike. Because to me, the imaginary worlds in those pages were better places than where I was. I have few friends. I have a childhood best friend whom I always talk to. Maybe without this friend, I wouldn’t have made it through. I didn’t have a relationship with my siblings, either. They were introverts like me. 

You never supported my interests. You wanted me to study ballet. I didn’t. You wanted me to learn piano. I didn’t. I wanted to take guitar and drum lessons. You didn’t. Because “it doesn’t have a tune”, you say. You wanted me to take Nursing. I didn’t. I wanted to take up Psychology. You didn’t. Coz according to you, “what kind of work will you get?” (Smh)

I am my own person, Mom. I know I’m not the daughter you wanted. It’s always been clear to me.
One time in high school, during a Spiritual Retreat with parents, I tried reaching out to you by writing you a letter. I thought I was opening a communication channel between us. Wow was I wrong. You just got more disappointed and angrier. No wonder we didn’t have a relationship. But you.. you were wondering why I was so distant. You were telling all relatives that I was a rebellious teenager. You didn’t even try, at least try, to listen. Not even once. Not once. I don’t ever recall you letting me speak. Coz in your mind you were always right. And your child will always be wrong. 

I finally graduated from College. Finished Engineering coz I love Math and Physics. Nobody told me that if you love Math or Physics then just take Physics or Math. Hah! No regrets, it brought me where I am now — with above average pay grade. 
I dreamt of finally being financially free, to be emotionally and physically free from you :( being away from you.. it made me so happy. And, yes, free. Free from all negativities. I saw colors. I saw rainbows and unicorns. 

My siblings, when they finished their college degrees and moved out of the house, they became like shining stars in their own fields. They got friends like they never had before. Call it maturity or whatever.. but they’re not the introverts I grew up with anymore. 

In my late 20s I got pregnant out of wedlock. I didn’t want to get married, honestly. I didn’t love the man anymore. But you.. you insisted. I hope I did not listen. Now I’m stuck in hell. 

But having a child.. it changed me. It’s the best thing that ever happened to me. I never thought I was capable of giving so much of myself to anyone. And I never imagined receiving a love so pure, so true, so great from a little human. It is a wonderful feeling. So wonderful that I don’t understand why you.. seem to never have felt it. I do understand that raising a human suck the life out of someone. But it also gives back so much more..

You seemed happy seeing your first grandchild. I needed you. You seemed happy to help. And I thought to myself, we finally created a relationship after, what, almost three decades? I was happy. 

But then, after some time.. you were angry again. Because I needed someone trustworthy to watch over my child. Because child care in our country is not easy to get. My child is old enough to be left alone playing, but still young to be left alone in a house. Husband’s home only on weekends because work is far. So I need you, Mom. 

For some reason, you seem to be rejecting happiness. You don’t want anything to do with us anymore. I am not requiring you to do anything, just be with my child. But you don’t want it anymore. Instead of being grateful to the universe because, finally, we have a relationship.. you find something wrong with it. I don’t understand why. 

You never should have created a family, Mom. I want to be free from you again.. because you are not happy with us anymore. I pray you’d be happy, Mom. Really happy. I know it’s not me, nor my child, nor my siblings. Not even dad. Whatever it is that will make you happy, I hope you get.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Mom,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But thats just life. people get betrayed all the time, they end up lonely and thats how many of us will die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know?i was lonely too, many times in my life, some get used to it, and learn to live with himself only, or find friends&lt;strong&gt;. others never learn how to be alone but not feel lonely,and they dont find friends as well&lt;/strong&gt; - these are kinda doomed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so i rejected my dad and he gone total butthurt screaming at me etc ..&lt;/p&gt;

I've been holding this in and I just need to let it out. Believe it or not, I could have said more.

My parents (51M, 50F) had three kids: me (23F), my sister (20F), and my brother (18M). My mother is Asian and my father is Hispanic. Whenever my dad gets drunk he tells the same story of how my mother's family didn't approve of their relationship, ignored him, and would tell him things like ""you'll never end up together, why bother"". I never thought it would be an issue for me to date interracially considering my parents are in an interracial marriage.

I met my boyfriend (23M) when we were both 21. He's black, didn't finish college, and is from the inner-city. To me, none of that matters because he treats me well, works hard, and wants to go back to school. From the jump my dad didn't like him. He'd say that ""their"" culture isn't like ours, ""their"" values are not the same as ours, that they're not family-oriented and just use and impregnate their girlfriends only to leave them later. Awful, just awful racist things. My mom asked me not to bring my boyfriend to the house because of how my dad felt about it, so I didn't. I thought I was being respectful and hoped that eventually they'd come around.

I tried to invite everyone to my events to introduce them on neutral territory, but it was obvious that my parents didn't want my boyfriend there (weak handshakes, no eye contact, no conversation, etc.) Eventually, I just kept my lives separate. Friends and boyfriend over here, family over there. Due to financial reasons I live in my parents house several hours away from my friends and boyfriend, so there was some creativity (lies) involved whenever I wanted to see them. The lies were small at first, but they got to the point where I would shut my phone off for days so my parents couldn't track my location. Naturally, panic ensued when I wouldn't answer their calls/texts. They'd contact all my friends, the hospitals, the police, the morgue. They came to look for me, they put me on missing persons lists. It got out of hand. I was never in any real danger, I was just with my friends who would lie for me and cover for me because they too thought my parents were being overprotective and controlling.

After years of my lies and the tracking my phone/laptop/watch, I myself am torn over how to feel. On one hand, I've disrespected them by lying repeatedly about where I am, what I'm doing, and who I'm with. They raised me and supported me financially. My childhood was a happy one and they worked so hard to give me the things I wanted. I know my parents love me deeply seeing as how three doctors told them they'd never conceive a child on their own. And I know I've hurt them time and time again. On the other hand, I'm 23 and I don't feel like this will ever stop. I feel trapped and alone.

Two weeks ago, I asked if I could go to the city to spend my boyfriend's birthday with him. The result? A huge argument that ended in me leaving. I put a change of clothes into a backpack and had one of my friends pick me up. I slept at her house for a few nights then went to the city to be with my boyfriend. After several days, my parents said they don't want me to start my life living paycheck to paycheck and that if I come back home, we can work on our relationship. I came home because I really believed this was the start to something different. 

I know it's still early, but nothing's changed. In fact, I think things are worse than before. My sister and dad don't look at or talk to me. My brother and mom will only talk to me if we're alone. Currently, I'm listening to them have a movie night that I only found out about because I walked downstairs to get a glass of water. No one said anything until I started up the stairs and then it was all jokes and laughter. I know that they believe I should be the bigger person and work to prove that I'm different, but it's exhausting being the only one trying.

Overall, I'm just sad. I never should have come back. The day I left, I should have thought to pack more clothes and to collect my documents. I wholeheartedly believe they'd be happier as a family of 4 and every day being back has been proof to that statement. I feel so stupid because I truly believed things could change and now I'm stuck here for at least a year.

I had to leave my last therapist (who I was seeing for mostly depression related issues) a few months ago. During one of our final sessions he threw this line at me regarding my relationship: ""it seems like your hesitation about getting married has more to do with *you* than it does your feelings for your girlfriend."" Sadly we never got the opportunity to really explore this, but something came out this past weekend which may have provided a clue.

This past Saturday my girlfriend pushed the marriage conversation again. I'm definitely on board with getting married but I just... *don't*, for some reason. She kept asking what my reasons are and finally I starting talking about my family. My relationship with them isn't bad but it's been very distant for years now and I don't know why. I rarely visit them. My few conversations I ever have with them are purely superficial. My girlfriend, in contrast, is extremely close with her family.

I mentioned how I don't talk with my parents often. How I feel bad because my sister has a host of her own mental health issues that have prevented her from having her own independent life. How my brother has anxiety issues and (I'm told by my parents) has few romantic prospects in his life and is very lonely. And how all of this goes on without me really being involved or there to support them.

My girlfriend asked the obvious question: ""what does any of that have to do with getting married?"" Out of nowhere I suddenly felt my eyes well up and said ""I would just feel even more distant from them."" 

The conversation ended there, my girlfriend didn't want to upset me. I'm between therapists right now so I don't really know what to do with this bit of info. I've thought about calling my dad this week to try to broach this subject but stuff like this has always been difficult for me. Thinking about all this has made me more eager to propose but something in me keeps telling me I need to resolve something with my family first. Or at least start that conversation.

I don't know what sort of feedback I'm really looking for by posting this, just having trouble figuring out why poor relationship with my family would impact the strength of the relationship with my girlfriend.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally posted this in &lt;a href=""/r/adultdepression""&gt;r/adultdepression&lt;/a&gt; but maybe it&amp;#39;s more appropriate here. &lt;/p&gt;

During one of our final sessions he threw this line at me regarding my relationship: &amp;quot;it seems like your hesitation about getting married has more to do with &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; than it does your feelings for your girlfriend.&amp;quot; Sadly we never got the opportunity to really explore this, but something came out this past weekend which may have provided a clue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past Saturday my girlfriend pushed the marriage conversation again. I&amp;#39;m definitely on board with getting married but I just... &lt;em&gt;don&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt;, for some reason. She kept asking what my reasons are and finally I starting talking about my family. My relationship with them isn&amp;#39;t bad but it&amp;#39;s been very distant for years now and I don&amp;#39;t know why. I rarely visit them. My few conversations I ever have with them are purely superficial. My girlfriend, in contrast, is extremely close with her family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned how I don&amp;#39;t talk with my parents often. How I feel bad because my sister has a host of her own mental health issues that have prevented her from having her own independent life. How my brother has anxiety issues and (I&amp;#39;m told by my parents) has few romantic prospects in his life and is very lonely. And how all of this goes on without me really being involved or there to support them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend asked the obvious question: &amp;quot;what does any of that have to do with getting married?&amp;quot; Out of nowhere I suddenly felt my eyes well up and said &amp;quot;I would just feel even more distant from them.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation ended there, my girlfriend didn&amp;#39;t want to upset me. I&amp;#39;m between therapists right now so I don&amp;#39;t really know what to do with this bit of info. I&amp;#39;ve thought about calling my dad this week to try to broach this subject but stuff like this has always been difficult for me. Thinking about all this has made me more eager to propose but something in me keeps telling me I need to resolve something with my family first. Or at least start that conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what sort of feedback I&amp;#39;m really looking for by posting this, just having trouble figuring out why poor relationship with my family would impact the strength of the relationship with my girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

The gist of it is that I am a 33 year old male that is currently living at home with my mom and step father. Our daily life here is fine, I get along with my mom and step dad and I'm diligently working each day to get some things together so I can move out in the summer time. My mom and I have always had a pretty close relationship. However, the (main) issue is with my 40 year old brother, who does not live here but lives close by. He doesn't work, he doesn't do anything really. He has a history of drug abuse and addiction, some type of personality disorder and depression. Growing up he got kicked out of every school he ever attended. He was raised mainly by my dad who basically enabled his drug habits - gave him money all the time, never put his foot down with anything. My dad passed away a couple years ago and as a final 'gift' to my brother he left him a rather significant inheritance that enables my brother to continue not working at least for the better part of a decade. He isn't currently on any hard/street substances but is taking methadone daily and, I believe, other prescription medications. He did go to rehab shortly after my dad died and there were little glimpses of hope there for a while but it didn't last long.

The issue is this - I feel as though my mom has basically replaced my dad in enabling him. She'll pick him up to drive him random places like the barbershop, she'll drive him to get his prescriptions, she'll drive him to and from our house and make dinner for him. To all of this he shows absolutely no gratitude, in fact, he's a total SOB. He'll talk to her like crap a lot of the time, hang up the phone on her, make thinly veiled threats, throw tantrums, come over and eat and not even offer to help, and manipulate her in various ways. And generally speaking he walks around with a chip on his shoulder - he acts like he's better than people, he's condescending in his tone, he's someone you wouldn't want to spend an hour with. And my mom will get angry but she'll continue to take it all. She'll say she isn't going to help him out anymore but she'll continue to do so. It's a whole cycle that just continues to repeat itself over and over.

I have had the conversation with her a hundred times that she needs to put her foot down, she needs to stop babying this 40 year old man, she needs to set boundaries and stick to them. She will cry, get frustrated, say that I don't understand because I don't have children. And then she will continue to complain to me (literally daily) about his behaviour, how she's so upset, how she can't deal with it anymore, etc. She is a total softie. And on it will go.

I mean, I want to be there for her, I want to be there for my family, I do a lot to help my mom out and help out around the house and let her know that I'm grateful for what she does. But at the same time it is god damn grating on my emotional and mental well-being to just see this cycle continue to repeat and to see my mom get ground down by him.

Also, it is so difficult to have any kind of compassion for my brother. We had a terrible relationship growing up, he tormented me endlessly as a child to the point where I can remember literally wishing and praying that he would die when I was 8 or 9 years old. I've matured enough to realize that the way he is, in large part, isn't exactly his fault, but at the same time I have almost no compassion for him because there is no foundation to our brotherhood, there's only pain and shame and hatred.

What it comes down to is that if my mom weren't around I would absolutely have no relationship with him, I would likely not give him my address or phone number. He offers nothing, he only takes, he's like a vortex that just consumes everything. But, my mom is here, and I can't do that. I feel as though I have some responsibility to be a sounding board for her, to let her vent.

What do you guys think is the best approach here? Have you dealt with something similar. I assume some people will say therapy but, although I would agree, it will just never happen for us.

My mom is horribly, incredibly racist towards black people. She doesn’t hide her bigotry, but it doesn’t come out until after she encounters anyone she’s bigoted towards. 

She’s an Indian immigrant who has lived here in the United States for almost 30 years with her husband, my father, who is a white man, and she has two mixed kids, my older brother and me. I know she’s dealt with a lot to be able to live here, including I learned earlier this year about how my father’s elder siblings were absolutely horrible towards her and occasionally continue to be.

When I was much more naive, I’d have thought that maybe she’d be able to have sympathy for other people of color. I used to think that maybe she wouldn’t have wanted to give her kids’ significant others the same prejudice and verbal abuse she received from her in-laws. I once thought that she’d be able to accept whoever her children chose to be their partner in life so long as we were happy. Irony is, unfortunately, completely lost on her.

My brother is deeply in love with his current girlfriend, who he met doing community work abroad and moved in with when they both finished up their service. My mother hasn’t been happy about any part of his current relationship because my brother’s girlfriend is biracial. Specifically, she’s half black. Since his girlfriend has already met our parents, due to the fact that she and my brother live a couple cities south of us, and her parents were going to fly in to visit our part of the country, my brother wanted to have both our parents meet her parents over dinner. My mother refused immediately when my father brought up the topic, and they both got into a fight on their anniversary over it. My brother specifically wanted to have our mother be there because even with all the misery she’s giving him over this, she’s still the woman who raised us, and we both still love her in spite of her behavior.

These past couple of weeks, my mom has refused to speak to my father and has, per usual, twisted the situation so that in her mind it’s my father’s fault for ruining their anniversary by fighting with her over this, rather than admitting that maybe her staunch racism isn’t going to benefit anyone, especially not herself. She’s been sleeping on the couch and is even using my bathroom instead of hers, which I’m especially not happy about. When she does speak with my father, it just becomes another screaming argument that ends with her crying and threatening to move back to India.

I don’t want her to move back or even be threatening to move back to India. I don’t want her encroaching on my space in the house. I don’t want her to think that she can survive by being petty and mad over the fact that her eldest child is deeply in love with a woman who just happens to be half Black. I don’t want to have to think that she has control over this situation by twisting everything so she’s the victim in all this.

I can’t deal with this, and it’s wearing on my mental health and hurting the relationships in my immediate family. Any advice is welcome.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, throwaway account because I’m at my wits end and can’t stand this&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve always been her top priority and I go to college 15 min away from home so she sees me on weekends and a lot during the week. The time though that I was away at college was really rough on her. She admitted to being depressed and lonely (even when she was still with her Sue) and never really got out of the house much...she fills her time with cleaning the house and talking to me and doesn’t have any hobbies. ANYWAY...I’ll be away for 9 weeks this summer and I’m so worried about leaving her alone now that she and Sue have broken up.

She and her partner of 11 ish years (they don’t live together and I don’t view her as another parent) have always argued a lot and have broken up for maybe a day or two at most before...let’s just call her partner Sue. ANYWAY they’ve been fighting and yelling a lot at each other recently and actually broke up today. I THINK it’ll be for good this time. My mom has never seemed completely happy in her relationship and they’ve always fought a lot. Let just say there’s been a lot more negative vibes overall than positive. I’m also pretty devastated for my mom though because she doesn’t really have any other friends, and she works from home. I’ve always been her top priority and I go to college 15 min away from home so she sees me on weekends and a lot during the week. The time though that I was away at college was really rough on her. She admitted to being depressed and lonely (even when she was still with her Sue) and never really got out of the house much...she fills her time with cleaning the house and talking to me and doesn’t have any hobbies. ANYWAY...I’ll be away for 9 weeks this summer and I’m so worried about leaving her alone now that she and Sue have broken up.

I tried to not listen to her but its really hard.
The only thing i couldve done was to stay in my room all day and not talk to her. And so, when i have to go down to eat, she tells me new stuff like "" you stay in your room because no one invites you"", ""you dont stay with your family""...
And my stepdad hates to argue with her because it can last hours, so he always goes by her side (against me) and criticize me for a long time).

My mother is dying, and i havent been able to see her much.
We live in different states and she has been taking care of my 11 year old son whom my uncle and aunt adopted then my aunt (her blood sister) abandoned my son so she could do drugs. I was just 18 by two months when i had him so my options were scarce. Anyways, we are 7 hrs apart and i now have a 3 year old daughter. My daughter and son have seen one another once, after my mom had her first brain surgery. My son has always been there with my mother and he is so much like me, avoiding this whole situation with her.. If you mention it to him he says he doesn't wanna talk about it and ignores it..

Two years ago (almost exactly) she was diagnosed with glioblastoma stage 4 multiforme. Terminal cancer
They removed as much as they could that first year, it went from a racketball sized tumor to a golfball sized. They can't remove certain parts due to location on her brain and certain nerve damage associated with it. So, radiation and chemo was next, and they told her she had at best 18 months to live. Now, after two surgeries and all the chemo and radiation they can no longer operate because it has ""grown fingers"" in her brain and reached parts they can't safely get to. She then lost  circulation in her leg and fell, they eventually had to amputate her leg because of the infection and She has been bed ridden at her home ever since and then she started losing feeling in her arm. Completely out of it and reliant on everybody for anything, eating, going to the bathroom etc. 


I had a few chances to see her this year but avoided them because i was scared. I told her before if she is ready to stop trying to fight she doesn't have to stay suffering for anyone. Everything is up to her. 
I love her so fucking much and i am so scared that if i go down there, she will see us and finally let go after. But at the same time if she is ready i have to let her go. 

I don't know how to act or what to say to her

What do you possibly say to your parent on their death bed? Knowing it would be the last time you ever see them!??

Hey guys!

How to play the piano for kids by PianoCourse101 is based on the Bastien Piano Basic Series for children. The Bastien Piano Basic Series consists of four levels. There are the ""Primer Level"", ""Level 1"", ""Level 2"" and ""Level 3"". I will eventually be uploading all of the courses on youtube. The first few lessons of the ""Primer Level"" are free and available on youtube while the rest of the lessons will be available on my website, which will be announced pretty soon. Lesson 1, Lesson 2 and Lesson 3 are paid courses. I believe that PianoCourse101 offers piano lessons that is not only well structured by engaging for children. Utilising a white board with rhythm exercises, explaining terms in a visually presentable manner is one unique method in making learning fun for kids.

After being periodically homesick and waking up in the middle of the night crying because of dreams related to my dad, I've come to terms with how my family's interaction has affected me throughout the years. 

&amp;#x200B;

In my last year of high school, my dad suddenly wanted me to study for the medical school entrance exam after no career support or guidance for the past \~10 years. ""Okay, sure I'll take the exam,"" I thought, even though I wasn't 100% sure what I wanted to do after graduating. After missing the benchmark by approximately 5%ile, my dad felt devastated, but I could come to terms with this score as most people study for 2-3 years beforehand whereas I only studied for 6 months, whilst balancing final high school class/exams, hence the chance of me naturally passing was low. Still, this sudden desire my dad had for me to pursue medicine made me question why he wanted me to study med in the first place. I had always expressed my how little respect I had for parents who push their bright children to only study medicine for the high salary and social status, where nothing else would suffice, often placing immense pressure and psychologically affecting them and I always convinced myself I wasn’t in that situation. I still try to convince myself to this day, after finishing my first semester of university doing a rigorous double degree. Hell, I even had to bargain with my dad about doing this double degree as it allowed me to take pre-med units and apply for another exam to be qualified as ‘medical students’ and not ‘pre-med students’. 

&amp;#x200B;

To offer context about our family dynamic, my mum is the extroverted type who would often crack jokes and teasingly comment about this-or-that whereas my dad was introverted to the point where he did not have many close friends and was not very trusting of people. These personality traits would become fuel and fire when it came to the household because my mum’s witty comments and my dad’s lack of self-confidence and short temper would result in spontaneous fights about the most ridiculous things. Back when I was younger (8) and my mum was pregnant with my brother and the most vivid part of one of their fights I remember to this day (17) was my dad physically throwing my mum down onto the wooden floor and her laying next to the brick wall crying. I didn’t realise it at the time but obviously, this classifies as a major red flag and is domestic abuse. Usually, I try to step in-between of my parents when they’re fighting but one incident when I was genuinely terrified was when I tried to split them apart and my dad redirected his anger towards me and held me by my neck and yelled/spat in my face to move. 

&amp;#x200B;

These fights and acts of abuse would often occur periodically. Sometimes we’d be a happy family and other times my dad would create a sullen atmosphere for weeks because of something like ‘mum didn’t cater to his meals because she was sick’ or ‘he lost an important file because his office area is a mess’. 

It’s as if he is a child himself and expects my mum to take care of the kids (3), cook, clean, work and keep him happy. During arguments he’d refuse to listen and now when we argue, I have to flat-out state ‘if you want to talk to me, stop yelling and talk normally’ or ‘I’ll let you speak and explain your side without interruption’ to which I expect the same vice versa, but am rudely denied the opportunity. It feels unfair that I try to logically talk to the equivalent of a brick wall, and especially since I’m the oldest child of three, his inability to step-up to be a responsible parent meant my mum had to rely on me when raising my younger siblings. Back then, it was something I thought was expected but now I am at the point where I feel so burdened to watch out for my brothers (even being in a different state to them), that I am unsure if I want children of my own. No child should be growing or be exposed to such an environment and recently I’ve been using this logic to explain why I don’t want to pursue medicine. After repeatedly asking my dad why he wants to study medicine, to which I get no proper response, I often get so worked up and cry because of his tunnel-vision on medicine even though deep down I know I’m not cut out for it. I have such high respects to people who study medicine with a genuine desire to help patients that pursuing medicine without this passion of my own feels wrong and contradictory to my own beliefs. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess at the end of the day, I feel as if I’m not being supported by my dad with my choices and forced to do another degree (albeit I wouldn’t mind getting accepted for), even though I know (or I fear) I will not be good enough. My mum, on the other hand, is often caught in the cross-fire between my dad and consoles me by saying she supports me doing whatever I want to do – which consequently adds more fuel to the flame as my dad retorts back saying how ‘your mum is straying you off-path’ or ‘you’re just saying that to go against me’ etc. 

There are more influencing factors and incidents (ie. the police getting called to my house) but for now, I think this gives a broad enough picture. 

&amp;#x200B;

I like to classify myself as an extrovert who is willing to listen to other people’s problems and offer support, I haven’t opened up about this part of my life to anyone in my nearly 18 years of being alive. My closest primary school friends (elementary) don’t know about this, my closest high school friends don’t know and neither does my boyfriend so I guess the first people to really hear about this will be strangers on Reddit. 

Or my actual boyfriend will read this (coincidentally because he likes browsing Reddit) and not realise it’s me…

Our dad is toxic, violent (one time, he thew boiling water on my sister, and he said that if he had a knife, he would've stabbed her). 
We're terried of him (every time he comes home from work or whatever, we have to run to our rooms because he doesn't want to see us and know that we are here or that we exist). 

I don't know if it's a good or bad thing, but he doesn't yell at us ""directly"" : Our parents fight almost every day and we simply hear what he thinks and says about us. 

He's always criticizing and insulting us (and he makes weird remarks), for example : We're useless/failures/lazy, we'll never be successful, etc. We're asexuals (because we never brought guys home, don't try to understand, it's absurd) and apparently, if we sleep with a hot water bottle in the winter, it's because we crave the warmth of a man...???

Oh and probably TMI, but it's important : Yesterday, we found out that he was regularly peeing in a bottle, so he didn't have the misfortune of running into us (to go to the bathroom, you have to go through the dining room, which we're usually in). 

We can't take it anymore. We live in constant fear.

So I've had some family issues over the past 20 +years I've been alive, and genuinely I don't know what to do anymore as I just want to be left alone on this issue.

Me and my father's relationship was not abusive, and my parents had divorced when I was at an age when I couldn't understand what was going on so it's always been natural for me to see my parents separately.

My mother got custody of me, and my dad got to have me every other day plus every other weekend. I looked forward to hanging out with him every time I could.

The thing is, my father had this extreme way of thinking, and didn't listen to reality or think as clearly. And when he was particularly upset over my mother, he wouldn't keep his comments to himself.

No, what he would do is vilify her to me. Enough to the point where I believed it, as she was the only disciplinary figure in my life, and I was a young and confused kid.

But she raised me the best she could and did more for me in comparison (getting a car, apartment, college, etc.). Meanwhile he would neglect child payments and is still being harassed by the courts to finish them after 3+ years of me being an adult. Even going so far as to sell his old house that was literally down the street from me when I was about 12 , to moving down over 3 states just to get away from her. (didn't help it was around christmas too.)

Years passed, I visited him on occasion and thought nothing of it. I believed his every word and thought of him as an amazing man. He even gave me a tape recording of her ""infidelity"" confession (it was garbled nonsense I couldn't hear a thing).

I believed him for years, and grew to have a lot of emotional and anger issues over the years. There was always this uncomfortable knot in my stomach and I couldn't explain why. It makes me ashamed to even admit I took my frustration out on my siblings, bullying and being an awful older sister.

Well, I was sitting in a college club 3 states away from my home town when the realization finally dawned on me what my father had done, why I was so hateful towards my family, and why I was always so angry towards the woman who loved and raised me for years.

He hadn't done anything to help me over the years but he blamed my mother for everything. The woman who bent over backwards to make sure I had a good life.

I felt immediate shame and tears, and I had to run out of the room before I broke down. My roommate at the time found me and consoled me until I could shuffle to the bathroom.

There, I texted my mother and asked her finally,

""Why did you and dad divorce?""

And she told me. And it made sense. His laziness, his unwillingness to help raise me, but she still wanted me to be near my own father even during the divorce when he was angry at her for marrying another man.

Meanwhile he's never said a good thing about her, ever. He still would ask me even after I moved out to live with him, even when I've said no.

Ever since that day (about February 2018), I've refused to speak to him until I calmed down. Because I know if I tried, he'd get defensive, or I'd be unable to even say anything and just silently agree with him like an idiot to protect myself from confrontation. Even now I can't speak about him without being upset. He has had a way of speaking that made negotiations impossible. Especially when it came to politics and family.

He's attempted to contact me a few times. Through facebook and calling me but I'd blocked both by now. Now his mother and my mother are trying to tell me to forgive my father. My grandmother saying she had disapproved of him filling my head with his ramblings but he should be forgiven so I don't have any ""regrets"". Same with my mother.

My grandmother and mother have backed away a little, but they continue to ask about how I feel about him, and genuinely I don't know if I could look him in the eye with full confidence.

I think he's at the point in his life where he won't recognize mistakes he's made. I've told him repeatedly before my revelation to stop talking about my mom and such but he's always gone back to it.

Today I have enough things to be stressed out about, but I'm happier since I don't have to listen to him.

Should I stop listening to my gut and give him another chance? I've heard from his mother he's willing to try again, but this isn't new. This is just the one time I've finally put my foot down.

I get along with my mom's family a lot better since I finally got my shit together, and I make sure to spoil my siblings whenever I see them, and be the best older sister and daughter I can now. 

**TL;DR**

Dad can't keep badmouthing his ex to his very young child and grows up with a lot of emotional issues. After 20+ years she realizes he's full of shit and cuts off contact. Grandmother and mother asks her to forgive him, and she questions if she should ignore her own feelings and let him back into her life.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yoooo bit of a long one, so TL;DR at the end in case y&amp;#39;all need it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve had some family issues over the past 20 +years I&amp;#39;ve been alive, and genuinely I don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore as I just want to be left alone on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me and my father&amp;#39;s relationship was not abusive, and my parents had divorced when I was at an age when I couldn&amp;#39;t understand what was going on so it&amp;#39;s always been natural for me to see my parents separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother got custody of me, and my dad got to have me every other day plus every other weekend. I looked forward to hanging out with him every time I could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, my father had this extreme way of thinking, and didn&amp;#39;t listen to reality or think as clearly. And when he was particularly upset over my mother, he wouldn&amp;#39;t keep his comments to himself.&lt;/p&gt;

From Facebook I see that his wife talks to him a lot and he responds to his siblings but not me.

I spoke to his wife two weeks ago, following an argument, and she says they speak at least twice a day.

I’m afraid he went no contact with me over me asking his wife for money the week he left.  He progressively got more and more agitated with me, back when he would respond to my emails, and says he feels like his family of origin is shit!

I kind of blame his wife because she is rubbing the ways of her family off on him and he’s adopted their traditions and ways.  For instance, her family acts like asking for money is a sin, but they buy each other expensive gifts instead.  So I don’t see much of a difference.

Today I got a package in the mail for their “distance baby shower”
It was nice.  Custom M&amp;Ms, a mini plastic champagne, ultrasound photo and gender announcement.  On the card was their amazon baby registry and I see that majority of gifts are bought already.  So maybe she waited to send the package to me?! I don’t know.

Apologies for formatting- mobile user.

My brother has always loved video games, which I think is a pretty cool hobby. He's the type to always ask for a Steam giftcard whenever his birthday or Christmas rolls around. Sometimes I'll buy him in-game items if I'm feeling nice.

Recently, my brother has been clocking in around 8 hours a day in front of his PC screen. He's only supposed to be playing 2 hours a day. We used to have Microsoft screen time on the PC, but he did something and it no longer works. My mom and I get screentime reports and it's pretty....heavy hitting to know that my brother is perfectly fine playing 11 hours nonstop.

He rages a lot too. He yells slurs and throws chairs, sometimes threathening to hit our youngest brother for raising the ping too much and that it ultimately caused him to lose.

I love my brother, I really do. He's very smart and funny, and my mom and I would like to spend more time with him outside than trying to persuade him to eat dinner with the rest of us. But he has other priorities, I guess.

I don't know what to do. He was only supposed to play 2 hours a day in return for doing the diswashing after dinner everyday. Now, we're lucky if he does it after a week- it's as if he waits for either my mom or me to do it for him instead. I don't know how he got himself unlimited screentime- a few months ago I had to change ALL my passwords because it turned out he was giving himself unlimited screentime via my email.  I changed them again, but he still has unlimited. I don't know.

My mom can't reason with him because a) language barrier and b) he's too distracted. I can't reason with him because he just won't listen. My dad, the only authority figure my brother takes seriously, can't reason with him because he's in Asia every other month.

My parents and I thought giving him unlimited screentime for a while would let him get everything out of his system and slowly let him join us at dinner again. But it's clear that it's only fuel for the fire.

I don&amp;#39;t know how he got himself unlimited screentime- a few months ago I had to change ALL my passwords because it turned out he was giving himself unlimited screentime via my email.  I changed them again, but he still has unlimited. I don&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom can&amp;#39;t reason with him because a) language barrier and b) he&amp;#39;s too distracted. I can&amp;#39;t reason with him because he just won&amp;#39;t listen. My dad, the only authority figure my brother takes seriously, can&amp;#39;t reason with him because he&amp;#39;s in Asia every other month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents and I thought giving him unlimited screentime for a while would let him get everything out of his system and slowly let him join us at dinner again. But it&amp;#39;s clear that it&amp;#39;s only fuel for the fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reddit, what should I do?&lt;/p&gt;

However I come forth today to share with you my experiences and hopefully people could help me and my mental health as its declining steadily day by day. I think of killing myself on a weekly basis. 

So I'm going to start from the beginning for context. 
Firstly I'd like to add that I am of South Asian descent (I feel this is relevant to include as South Asian's are overly critical over how the females look and act.) 
Since I can remember, I have ALWAYS been compared to my sister, who is a year and a half younger than I am. Likewise to my mother, she has a petite frame and is shorter than I am. 
In contrast, I was a 'medium' frame girl and was tall as a child (I averaged out in my teens in regards to my height). 
Regardless of having a pretty face (tbh I was cute and have always had a pleasant face) I was ALWAYS called 'moti'  which translates as 'fatty'. 
As long as I can remember, I was labelled fat by my mum and my sister, who fed off of what my mum said. As a result, I BELIEVED them. And as a child in primary school, I perceived myself as a 'fat girl', which obviously negatively impacted on my self-esteem and confidence. 
It was things like ""you can't wear a summer dress for school because you look too big now"". This was in year 4! 
I believed her. I look back at photos and see a girl who is tall and healthy- AVERAGE  and I remember how I noticed things like my thighs. 
Things worsened in high school as I developed during puberty.  
The comments became worse from my mum, my sister and now my aunties from Bradford, who would always try to give me tips on how to lose weight etc. I naturally am I pear shape so I have hips. I remember always awkwardly posing for pictures, hiding my  hips with my arms - IN EVERY PHOTO. 
I repeat. Looking back at my photos - I was FAR  from fat!!! 
Age 15. Although I was very smart and excelled in academics, I was bullied alot in high school. Being the only Asian kid in the class,  and one with such low self esteem made me a prime target. 
Acne was another thing that plagued my life as a teen. I even had a dermatologist. Nothing worked. Acne was another thing everyone in my family scrutinised me on. Coupled with my negative body image and the bullying at school, I felt like  the dirt on the ground. 
I have a distinct memory of my mum telling me off on my birthday for having spots. I cried. 
She would use pure citric acid from lemons and apply it directly onto my acne. It burned. I still have scars on my cheeks to this day. Thank god for foundation. 

Simultaneous, my younger sister had her own issues and was going through an eating disorder - I would say she had borderline anorexia. 
She also had issues with being 'dark skinned' and was called 'kali' or 'monkey' often. 

As she got thinner and I stayed the same this triggered intensified comments about my weight to me. I would workout alot and eat little  and did lose a bit of weight but I was still 'fat' to  my family.  During my uncles wedding, my aunts made a comment to me that confused me but had also made me feel so inadequate. 
""Look, your sister and cousins (who were under 12 FYI) shop in the children's section. Look at you you have to go to the adult section.""
Why was a ridiculed for being a teenager that didn't have a childs body???
THIS WAS THE MENTALITY THAT SURROUNDED ME. 

I finished high school and in that summer I worked out so hard. I didn't eat much. I lost weight. I could see my ribcage stick out. 
I finally felt a bit thinner. 
I remember my mum saying ""don't lose anymore now"" as she saw my ribcage. 
Wasn't a positive - you look nice!! But I took it still as validation. 

Sixth form was great. I still wasn't SUPER confident. But I wanted to maintain this ""smaller than I should be"" weight. I had lots of friends and enjoyed myself. 
I was able to buy small clothes at the shops and fit into them. 
However, I still didn't get the comments i CRAVED from my mum like 'you look pretty' etc. 

Fast forward to university. I was studying for a teaching degree. I had a boyfriend. And I had friends. I was happy. 

However, I was beginning to slowly gain a bit of weight. The MINUTE that happened, it All began to happen again. 
When you are told that you are fat that is how you see yourself. I look back at my uni pictures and see a slim and pretty girl. But at the time I had no confidence. I ate because it healed the pain for me. I thought ""I am fat right? Might as well eat"". 

From then on I slowly slowly gained more weight. During my graduation I still was not 'fat'. I was chubbier than before but I was treated like I was Fat FAT. I remember crying 5 minutes before my graduation photo was taken as my parents had little regard for me and what I had achieved (because really I should have been a medical graduate according to my mum). My parents  had their own issues and thought my grauation was the best place to hash it out. Unlike my sisters graduation, which was a beautiful day, my parents were happy and so proud of my sister and made comments  about how beautiful she looked etc. 

Fast forward a few years. Just before I got engaged (my marriage is a standalone story in itself!! So much drama and stress!!) I had gained a bit of weight. I was a bit chubby. But nothing concerning. I was still pretty. I still looked nice. But NOOO not in the eyes of my family who continued to spew advice on weight loss. 
2 months before I was due to be married, aged 24, fatter than I'd like to be but still not FAT.  My mum had chose my wedding dress (are any of you surprised!?) which was a size 8. The size I was in 6form.  I was a size 12 and had 2 months to fit in the dress. I was not in the mental state to lose weight the normal way as there had been many blips and issues on my road to getting married. It had caused me to be very very anxious and is the point where I developed anxiety disorder. I was afraid the marriage wouldnt go ahead because my parents would change their mind or say my finance was not good enough etc. 
So I had opted to take part in a fad Diet. I had to essentially starve myself and only drank 3 shakes a day. 
Well it worked. 
I lost the weight and fitted into my dress. 

However. I became ill. I had made my gut poorly. And have been on medication since. The minute I got off my diet, the effects were horrific. I would eat ANYTHING and swell like a baloom. Going from a size 10 in the morning and looking like I was 6 months pregnant after I ate. 

It just demotivated and disheartened me. 

This alongside my parents OTT scrutiny of me and my married life. Asking about my money, telling me to stick to my culture and not to deviate, telling me I'm not doing things right, telling me I make shit choices, telling me Im lazy. Just lecturing. 

My anxiety went through the roof. 
I gained weight. 
I had anxiety walking past my mums house. 
I do this daily to get to mine. (I was pretty much forced to buy the house close to theirs) 
I just couldn't function anymore. 
As the weight piled on, the comments I'd receive would get nastier and nastier and to the point that it was a daily struggle for me to even go. 

I didn't mention this earlier but I have a younger sister who was born when I was in sixth form. She is my happiness in that house and I felt as though I was abandoning her by not going down.

Now here I am. 2.5 years later. 26 years old and the heaviest I've ever been. I'd say objectively that I am fat now. 

But I feel the same I've felt my whole life. 
What's changed the most is that my family treat me worse. 
My extended family comment on my weight. 
I can't go to my mums house without crying at least once. As my weight is mentioned so negitavely AGAIN AND AGAIN. 

I don't feel like a human anymore 

When you're actually fat people treat you like the scum of the earth. 

I have no confidence anymore. 
It's all gone. 
I wake up daily and feel as though I can lie in bed all day. 
I dont want to face the world. 
I don't want to see anyone. 
I feel like I shouldn't exist.
I wish I was dead ALOT. 

I wish I had a kinder family. 

I know one thing though. I will never Ever treat my child like this.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Reddit, this is my 1st post eek&lt;/p&gt;

It was super rough at first but we’re a lot more stable now. When we were younger they were always working and even now they leave the same time as I do for school at 6:30 am in the morning and come back around 8 pm. But because of that I don’t really have good childhood memories of them and if anything I don’t remember much at all other than mostly bad memories which sucks because I’m sure I was much more loved than I think but because all I can remember are mostly the bad memories, it’s hard to keep it from affecting my relationship with my parents. To be more specific they don’t really feel like my parents. If anything my sister pretty much raised me. But what sucks is that I love both my parents a lot. I know they had to go through so much crap to get us to where we are now and I know they love me and I know I should cherish the time I have with them but I just can’t. As soon as they get home it almost feels suffocating? Just less dramatic, it’s more like that slight annoying feeling. But I try to push it down and just go out and at least greet them before I retreat to my room. My mom usually tries to come and talk to me but this is where everything goes wrong. I’m already annoyed and don’t want to talk to her when she comes and obviously it shows in my attitude and she gets sad and I regret it but the feelings and annoyance just comes automatically and I try to fix it really but it’s so hard. Then my relationship with my dad is like just not very good. I think I belittle him. He’s kind of slow and since he immigrated but never learned English my sister and I have always had to take care of him and he’s the youngest in his family of like six older sisters so he’s a baby and it just gets frustrating sometimes. Like he’s so dirty and messy and it’s hard to respect him when he tells me to do stuff that he doesn’t even do. Even when he lived in Korea he went to college but didn’t end up doing anything with it and ended up with a manual labor job at my uncle’s company. The story of my parent’s meeting is super sucky and I’ve always wondered why my mom stuck with him. When I was younger they fought a lot and I never really liked my dad. My mom always told me to be nicer to him and to go easy on him when he’s being stupid or when he can’t control his emotions because he got into an accident once and was in a coma for a bit and I’m sure it has some influence but from my family’s stories he was like this before then too. But I think because of that his emotions are unstable. He’s always getting depressed and I’ve had to use find my iPhone to figure out where he is when he doesn’t come home until late at night cause we think he’s going for a drive since he’s depressed. His emotions are everywhere and it doesn’t happen often but when he gets mad he can’t control it. I came home at 11 once after hanging out at my friend’s house and I didn’t remember to turn on my ringer so I didn’t answer his phone calls and when I got home he kicked me out of the house after taking my stuff and my mom ended up picking me up when I was walking around the neighborhood. We’re a Christian family and so they’re always trying to talk to me like if they did anything to me they’re sorry and to tell them about it so they can apologize and talk through it but I’ve never talked to them about anything personal before. It’s so awkward and although I always just say it’s fine it’s ok because I know how much they love me and how much they’ve sacrificed for me, I can’t help but think I’m still affected by the times that was hurt by them and I still hold those grudges or something because I may be going through puberty or something but even I think it’s weird how uncomfortable I am around my parents and wish I could fix it. I don’t know what to do and I don’t think I’m going to end up talking about it any time soon so maybe distance will help once I go to college. I don’t know but I feel like this has just gotten worse since this was our first year alone without my sister to mediate between us. Because now all my parents have to worry about is me and they have nobody to talk to because my sister left for college. Sorry this was so long. I just needed to get it out.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m korean and my parents immigrated with my sister and I when I was four. It was super rough at first but we’re a lot more stable now. When we were younger they were always working and even now they leave the same time as I do for school at 6:30 am in the morning and come back around 8 pm. But because of that I don’t really have good childhood memories of them and if anything I don’t remember much at all other than mostly bad memories which sucks because I’m sure I was much more loved than I think but because all I can remember are mostly the bad memories, it’s hard to keep it from affecting my relationship with my parents. To be more specific they don’t really feel like my parents. If anything my sister pretty much raised me. But what sucks is that I love both my parents a lot. I know they had to go through so much crap to get us to where we are now and I know they love me and I know I should cherish the time I have with them but I just can’t. As soon as they get home it almost feels suffocating? Just less dramatic, it’s more like that slight annoying feeling. But I try to push it down and just go out and at least greet them before I retreat to my room. My mom usually tries to come and talk to me but this is where everything goes wrong. I’m already annoyed and don’t want to talk to her when she comes and obviously it shows in my attitude and she gets sad and I regret it but the feelings and annoyance just comes automatically and I try to fix it really but it’s so hard. Then my relationship with my dad is like just not very good. I think I belittle him. He’s kind of slow and since he immigrated but never learned English my sister and I have always had to take care of him and he’s the youngest in his family of like six older sisters so he’s a baby and it just gets frustrating sometimes. Like he’s so dirty and messy and it’s hard to respect him when he tells me to do stuff that he doesn’t even do. Even when he lived in Korea he went to college but didn’t end up doing anything with it and ended up with a manual labor job at my uncle’s company. The story of my parent’s meeting is super sucky and I’ve always wondered why my mom stuck with him. When I was younger they fought a lot and I never really liked my dad. My mom always told me to be nicer to him and to go easy on him when he’s being stupid or when he can’t control his emotions because he got into an accident once and was in a coma for a bit and I’m sure it has some influence but from my family’s stories he was like this before then too. But I think because of that his emotions are unstable. He’s always getting depressed and I’ve had to use find my iPhone to figure out where he is when he doesn’t come home until late at night cause we think he’s going for a drive since he’s depressed. His emotions are everywhere and it doesn’t happen often but when he gets mad he can’t control it. I came home at 11 once after hanging out at my friend’s house and I didn’t remember to turn on my ringer so I didn’t answer his phone calls and when I got home he kicked me out of the house after taking my stuff and my mom ended up picking me up when I was walking around the neighborhood.

I (18F) feel like everything in my life has occurred because of my own hard work. I am proud of myself though, I’m 18 now and have already finished my first year of college. I’m a comp sci/math major and finished my first year with a 88% average (finished with a 98 in high school). I have a crappy retail job, which I dont enjoy but push through, and a boyfriend of 3 years. This was all to show that from the outside, I am doing well and have a ‘desirable’ life. But inside I’m suffering and struggling.

My parents are divorced and I alternate between my mom and dads throughout the week. I can legally do whatever I want but I choose to keep the custody schedule I had as a kid to keep both my parents happy. My parents have been divorced since I was 2 and this is how it’s always been for me. I feel disconnected from my mom because of anger and what happened when I was a kid (she cheated and caused the divorce) and I feel disconnected from my dad because of the emotional turmoil this has caused (it’s awkward for me to show emotion). 

My sister is living with my mom full time and doesn’t visit my dad anymore. I would leave my mom’s house and live with my dad permanently, but I don’t have the strength to carry that guilt (I shouldn’t feel guilty based on the circumstances) or stop seeing my sister. I need stability and I can’t go on living like this forever. I want to cut it off with my mom but I don’t know how to prepare for that emotionally or even carry it out without feeling horrible. 

It feels as though I was the accident child and fit nowhere. I want to feel loved and have a family. I hate Christmas every year because of how depressing it is. Usually I disappear on Thanksgiving to avoid choosing where to spend it or communicate with my family (its awkward to be thankful). I am young and I know that I have so much life left to live but how the hell does anyone get through this. 

My boyfriend is wonderful but I feel the exact same way with him. I feel as though I’m always putting in the effort to make things work perfectly and keep everyone happy. He doesn’t really openly show appreciation or compliment that often so it’s hard to feel wanted (I need reassurance a lot). It may not actually be this way but it feels as though I love him waaay more than he loves me. I break down a lot in front of him out of thankfulness because no one has ever stuck with me this long or been this sweet and kind to me (I don’t think I deserve that type of love). It’s important to note that we don’t really have issues. 

Another hard situation is that I had a dark front tooth from hitting my mouth when I was 11ish and lived with it for 7 years. It humbled me to the core until I decided this year to invest 1100$ of my own money to get a crown. The crown is still slightly too dark and can’t be replaced because the tooth underneath is so fragile (it isnt worth risking). 

These are just a few examples but nothing ever works out for me. Stuff only works when I invest a ton work or effort (or money) into fixing it, if im lucky. No matter who it’s with it feels like I am always the person that wants the other person. I never feel like anyone wants me as much as I want them. And it hurts because I would do ANYTHING  for anyone and I’m trying so hard to keep everything going for me because I want to live and create the life I should have had as a child. How do I keep going when it feels like life is pushing me back constantly. I am so tired and some nights I just cry and wonder why all of this had to happen to me. I understand that stuff like this makes people stronger, but damn this is hard. I’m not depressed or suicidal in any way but I KNOW if I passed away now, everyone would miss me so much andshow their love but I feel and receive none of it now.

&lt;p&gt;He still apologizes and I believe him when he says that he doesn´t mean it. But it hurts a lot and I´m much smaller than he is and also bruise easily so I kind of want to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(he hits my other brother too but they´re on one level, strength wise. My other siblings all hit me and each other a lot as kids but grew out of it when they hit puberty. But my youngest brother never stopped)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I´m worried that he´ll never stop and that he´ll one day hit his significant other. He has hit friends before and he´s screamed at his boss before when he got angry at them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this still normal for boys? Is this abuse or just how boys treat each other? How can I stop him if he gets angry again? And what could cause this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(also sorry if this is a mess, this is my first real post and english is not my native tongue)&lt;/p&gt;

My dad to this day does not understand the trauma I went through in wilderness/boarding school, and still thinks it was beneficial etc. (He is a very bad listener and will never admit to being wrong).

My sister and I are 12 years apart, I’m 22 and she’s 34. We have never spoken much due to the large age gap and her never really living with me. About 5 years ago she moved back home with her boyfriend of 6 years at the time after losing her apartment and shortly after I went to college for four years so I never really got to be with her. 

Her boyfriend lost his truck driving job after losing his license due to a DUI and he never started working ever again, they moved in and my mom allowed them to stay here and they’ve never left (for the past 5 years!) both without working and both in their 30s (he’s 5 years older than her) the only thing my sister does for money is prostitute herself every once in a while when they need the money AND he’s aware of this... when she receives the money after a night “working” she hands the money off to him and he’s able to receive any gifts that he wants.. xbox, games, a huge brand new 4K tv, sneakers.. anything! but when she wants something for herself he tells her “she doesn’t need it” 

They are both alcoholics and will spend many nights all day up drinking, sometimes being abusive to each other verbally and physically 

I’ve expressed countless of times towards my mom that she should not allow this behavior in her house, but she would simply say she does not want problems with my sister and she can’t throw her out into the street. 

Recently, about 6 days ago, while I was packing up my apartment in my college town after graduation...I received 5 phone calls at 4am from my sister and a voicemail of her crying but I couldn’t really make out what she was saying 

It turns out that night my older brother (who is going through a lot mentally) was drinking with my sisters boyfriend.. things got a little mixy and my brother went to my sisters room to inform her that he and her boyfriend were about to fight and instead of trying to stop the situation she came out the room and encouraged her boyfriend to fight him and “hit him like a man since he wants to fight like a man” and when her boyfriend did not comply she proceeded to attack my brother ... (he has bruises on his whole body and scratches on his face) so he fought her back to get her off of him (she only has bruises on her legs) the entire time her boyfriend WATCHED as they both fought without doing anything

When the rest of the family came back after graduation she came to us alongside her boyfriend and started crying saying that my brother had attacked her. So of course I was furious with my brother, but she was playing victim .. as she always does when she does not get her way.. I did not find out the truth until my brother came in and told me about it 

I informed my mom of the truth in what had happened and she didn’t address my sister on the lie she told until they went to a BBQ and started drinking ... at this BBQ my sisters boyfriend began talking to my mom about how she didn’t do anything to my brother when he “went crazy and attacked my sister for no reason” except he didn’t know my mom knew the truth.. my mom went crazy .. how is this man who is almost 40, does nothing for a living, encourages my sister to prostitute herself for money, and pays no rent trying to get her to kick her own son out? She left the bbq and explained he was never allowed to go into the house again until later that night my sister called the police crying outside the door saying she can’t get in to the house and her daughter was inside .. now they’re locked inside their room and haven’t came out since 

OH YEAH and she has a daughter, 13 years years old, and has NEVER taken care of her. My mother raised her and I call her my younger sister. I have memories of me being 9 years old being handed a newborn baby and having to take care of her for hours alone because my sister would go for a “smoke” and come back 2 hours later. My sister gets food stamps for her but spends it all on her and her boyfriend or sells her food stamps for liquor. It has only been recently that (within the past year or two years) that my sister gives her money or anything at all. 

I know that is my sister but I cant encourage this.. she takes public assistance when she is very able to get a job and work she lies saying she’s disabled and constantly files police reports so they will give her her own public housing. I don’t know what to do .... I don’t even know who she is or how are we related .. I feel like reporting her or doing something but that’s family right?

It got a little better when she left for college when I was almost 14. She failed the same math class 2 years in a row and decided to take a gap semester. That was when I was 15. She’s been to an anger management class and hasn’t scared me as bad recently, however we share a bathroom and she refuses to clean it or share the space at all. A month ago, she killed a cockroach (we’re not gross we just live in a heavily wooded area) at the top of the stairs and left it under a clear bin for 2 weeks straight and cried when my parents yelled at her asking her to clean it up. Last week, she left her cats vomit at the top of the stairs for a week under some paper towels and refused to clean it (even though it is in EVERY way her cat, she adopted it without my parents knowing and pays every bill for it because the cat is truly a demon). She also never cleans the cats litter box and it makes our kitchen smell and embarrasses my parents and I whenever we have guests over. She’s in a local college that my parents are paying for (9000 a month) and won’t help with the bills for it in anyway. She bought herself a gaming PC, new clothing, junk food, decorations for her room, fast food every single day, and still won’t pitch in with her college bills in any way. I feel so sorry for my sweet sweet mom because she can’t get her hair dyed or her nails done (which helps her feel more confident at work since she’s older than her colleagues) until my sister graduates in August. I love my parents both so much and I understand they don’t want to cut off their own daughter but they think it’s what “normal” kids are like since my brother (25)  and I are very gifted academically, very clean, respective, and responsible. She won’t take any advice from my parents or I on how to get her life together and it’s frustrating that I can’t get through to her. She’s overweight, doesn’t have a sense of money management, can’t pick good friends, and doesn’t have a good personality either. I try to suggest little things to her about maybe working out at home since she’s too self conscious to go to a gym, eating better, trying to make new friends, etc.. but she never listens to me. I don’t know how to get through to her that she needs to make changes in her life to survive in the real world. She blames every inconvenience on someone else. Failed a math class? Teachers fault. Can’t pay rent? Job didn’t give me enough hours. Overweight? My boyfriend of 2 months when I was 13 ruined me. She has stressed out my parents to the point where I feel like they’re not here for me anymore. I have experienced horrible trauma in my life and I can’t talk to my parents about it, I can’t ask them for advice because my sister ranted to them for an hour and a half about some person at work and they’re tired of “complaining” for the day, I can’t ask for help with college (next year is my senior year of high school) because my sister has exhausted them.

She also forced me into violin, which I hated, and pretty much refused to let me leave the mold she had in mind for me. At the same time, she also teased me for my weight when I was a kid, and this evolved into body dysmorphia and an eating disorder that I still struggle with today. For example, in 3rd grade, I never wore shorts at all because I was insecure of my fat legs (she made fun of them a lot), and now I struggle with clinically diagnosed anorexia. 

Things got worse when I was 15 and came out to my parents. I didn't even come out willingly; I finally told them I had been getting bullied for pretty much several years after no longer being able to take it because I was starting to develop severe depression and suicidal thoughts (I hid this from them for a while), and my mom kept yelling at me to find the reason for it (instead of sympathizing with me...), so I told them. Ever since then, she's always made so many comments about my sexuality and really looks down on me for my feminine presentation. Fast forward to when I was 19 and came home after finishing my freshman year of college, and we had a massive longtime fight after she found makeup in my room (literally not even dramatic makeup; it was foundation and a brow pencil). I think deep down, she resents me for not becoming the model of a son that she always wanted. 

I find that these days, our relationship is worse than ever. She always forces herself into my business and makes side comments that really bother me (makes fun of my style and mannerisms), and she also does this weird thing where she tries to force feed me and always insults my body/weight (which is SOOO ironic because this is a result of the anorexia that she helped to give me). She also insults me for my major and always tells me I'm never gonna get a job (I'm an English major who wants to enter journalism), but I try to just ignore this since my parents are helping to pay for my tuition. I always tell her to stop, but she never does and gets mad when I confront her about this stuff. She's also terrible to my older sister and tries to restrict her eating and calls her fat all the time, and no matter how many times I tell her to stop, she never gets that this is a bad thing. 

I think the best way to summarize this is that my sister and I never fit the strict molds that my mom has for us (pretty, skinny, smart for my sister; masculine, STEM, straight, tall for me), and she always takes it out on us by commenting on our ""faults,"" overall being really cold, and refusing to understand that this hurts us. When I was in high school, I think I was able to ignore this a lot because I was so used to it, but now that I live away from home during the school year for college, I find it harder and harder to deal with her. She's also pretty racist and classist, which leads to a lot of arguments between me and her. I think the presence of a slight language barrier makes this harder. She speaks absolutely no English and only speaks Korean, and while I speak enough Korean to have been exclusively speaking to her in Korean for the past 20 years, I don't think I'm fluent enough to really engage in deep conversations with her about this stuff.

This was honestly more of a way to vent explicitly while still remaining relatively anonymous, but I suppose if anyone has any advice, that would be great, too.

Hot Car Deaths are sadly on the rise in the United States…

You can’t be comfortable with the fact that children are being left alone in vehicles for hours at a time, with the windows rolled up and the car turned off.

Would you be surprise if you were told that temperatures inside all vehicles are hotter than the temperatures outside and can reach over 100 degrees quickly, even with the windows, rolled down or cracked?

Or would you not believe it and continue to leave your child or children in hot vehicles.

When a child body temperature reaches a certain degrees, such as 104 degrees or less depending on the child, to 107 degrees or above, from being left alone, in hot parked cars, the child or children are at risk for not just organ damages, heat strokes, loss of consciousness, but deaths.

Some say leaving a child, in a hot, motor vehicle is neglect or abuse, even if the driver forgot the child was in the vehicle. Others say leaving a child, in a hot motor vehicle, can happen to anyone.

Take away: Children do play in unlock cars, as well as, the trunk…   
KEEP IT LOCKED!!!!

Whether it’s unintentionally (forgot) or intentionally (grocery shopping) leaving children in hot cars, which causes severe injuries, organ damages, heat strokes, loss of consciousness and deaths can be ruled a homicide.

Drivers upon exiting cars, SUV’S, School Buses and Daycare Vans don’t forget to take the child or children in the back seat or seats with you.   
Look back, get up and do a walk through…

I even offered to take most of the driving time on my end. I never heard back and no plans were made. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently he reached out to my mom saying that my youngest brother (I have 2 that I know of, there may be more) wants to meet me. According to my mom, my brothers mom is not doing well health wise and that is why he is now with bio dad and wants to meet me. I have no idea how old little brother is or anything about him other than his name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will I be the ass hole if I don’t want to meet him? Little brother is blameless but I have no desire to associate with that side of my family.&lt;/p&gt;

Sorry about formatting. Summary at the end. 

I love and appreciate my father very much. He lives close enough that I take my husband and kids to visit him and my mom about every two weeks. It brings me great joy to see my parents with my kids [2 and 5]. Over the last 6  months or so, there have been several incidents when he has gotten disproportionally angry at me (and today for the first time, my husband) and it comes out in fits of screaming in our faces in front of the kids. We don’t fight back. We just scramble to get our stuff together and get out of there as fast as we can. Then I spend the whole ride home trying to control my tears in front of my kids- not always so successfully. This has happened several times. 

We’ve been trying to help him with some home repair issues and granted, it is extremely frustrating for my dad but he is having disagreements with the neighbors over some of it and he is refusing to admit fault. He is so upset about it that he can’t be rational at all. I now understand that any discussion over anything related to the repairs will illicit this type of reaction but I’m afraid his anger will branch out soon to other areas. 

I’ve read a little about aging and depression and how it’s common for it to manifest as anger. He has always been hard to talk to and anything surrounding this issue is too frightening for me to approach with him. I don’t know what to say to him. His rationale seems to be waning as his years progress. He would never admit that he’s depressed and he would never talk to anyone about it. 

I’m too scared to call him because I feel like there will be no good outcome but I also don’t want to stop seeing him or my mom and I definitely don’t want to take their grandkids away. The kids don’t seem frightened of him, just concerned with how upset it makes me. 

We just got home from their house and I don’t know what to do next. My mom is no help. Despite admitting that it’s not ok to treat us this way, she thinks that we should just take it because he’s old and he’s depressed. I have no idea what to do next but thanks for reading to the end.

Pretty long overall so apologies in advance. 

My mother - 52F - Lives across the country from me (I moved away after graduating veterinary school, for work), just got back with her ex-husband (separated last summer). She has a history of relationships with ""bad"" men. She has poor self esteem and constantly requires validation from others, despite being an intelligent and hard-working woman. She also takes all advice as scathing criticism, no matter how well-intentioned, which makes her nearly impossible to give honest feedback to. 

My brother - 17M - He's ""too cool"" for us to have much of a relationship, plus a 10 year age difference, but we do get along fine. In high school, works part time, always out with friends/girlfriend. Mostly the odd Instagram DM or quick phone chat if I call my mom and he's around. It's a shame we're not closer, but it is what it is. 

Her ex (""D"") - 50sM - her fifth husband... I know... Long story. An alcoholic, angry, bitter drunk and petulent, immature man. A racist, homophobic ass. Also he's a rapist-sympathizer (""she was asking for it""). Can you tell I don't like him much?? Has a daughter in her 20s from previous marriage. 

The daughter - lives in another province from my mother and her ex. No relationship with her father except to ask for money. Drug addict (pills and coke maybe, from what I can gather), criminal (petty theft and possession) and can never hold down a steady job. Has mooched thousands off of my mother and D in the few years they'd been together. Dating a guy who is also.. Not a super productive member of society..

Me - 27F - as I said I live literally across the country. Have always been close with my mother but we have drifted in recent years because I find a lot of her behavior troubling, exhausting and I was tired of shouldering her burdens. A conscious decision to step back and keep our relationship at a distance while I focus on myself may be partially to blame for this situation...

The separation:
My mother and D had been together for roughly 6 years. They had been fighting a lot over the past year about his drinking and marijuana use (it wasn't legal at the time, she was worried he'd lose his job - as a truck driver) and him giving a lot of money to his daughter. Also he was constantly getting after my brother for... Being a teenager. Being out with friends, going to a party, having friends over, wanting to borrow the car, etc. He acted like a 16 year old himself 99% of the time so I don't see what his issue was but I digress. He threatens that either my brother moves out (again - he's 16!!!!!) or he does. Who even does that to a teenager. 

Eventually, my mom got fed up and kicked him out. Said if he could clean up his act and prove himself, maybe she'd take him back, whatever. I applauded her for standing up for herself and figured that was that. It was not.

His daughter comes to town and her and the unsavory boyfriend are at D's new apartment. They all get very drunk/high/who knows and the husband and the daughters boyfriend get in to a fight. Somehow, he ends up outside his apartment and they lock him out. He DRIVES to my mother's house, middle of the night, and wakes everyone up. He's covered in blood, clearly inebriated and recruits my brother and his friends (16 year olds at the time!!) to come back to his apartment with a ladder so he can break in the balcony and get back in. Where the daughter and boyfriend are, who are both criminals and obviously have no issue being violent. Not to mention he's DRIVING while intoxicated. Well my brother and his friends aren't dumb, they refuse to get in the car with him, and get my mother. She flips, tells him to leave or she'll call the cops, etc. He takes the ladder and goes.

Over the following few days he texts her constantly, asking for forgiveness. She isn't giving. Rightfully so. He endangered himself and my brother and his friends. He could have gotten them killed either in a drunk car crash or in a brawl with these degenerates or who knows. I was livid, and my mother was too. I thought thank God, it's over, she's finally seen what a terrible person he is and may we never see him darken the doorstep again.

Now:
She's posting photos on Facebook and he's in them. They're together, going camping, building a deck, walking the dogs. What. The. F%&amp;k.
She hasn't said a word to me. Not that they were talking again, not that he had been in touch, nothing. Just these photos.
I'm so angry. I can't believe she'd take him back. After everything he did, she's taken him back with seemingly no second thoughts or mention to me. I can't imagine how my brother must feel. This man was terrible to him.
I have no idea how to proceed. How to bring it up - ""so are you back with him?"" seems too easy, she obviously is. I want to yell, scream, tell her she's a damn idiot, but I know that won't work. It'll just cause a shut down or ""well fine you don't have to ever talk to me because I'm such a failure/embarrassment/bad mother/etc"". But at the same time, if he's living with her again then I'm not staying there. Full stop. If I go home to visit I will get a hotel, or stay with a friend. I will not be in the same house as him. I won't even see him, I will not subject myself to that. Also my poor brother?! I want to reach out, ask him how he's doing, but I'm not sure I'd get an ""honest"" answer. He's nearly done high school, and probably planning to move out soon anyways, but to have this man around, who is not quiet about his dislike... How terrible it must feel to have your mother choose him over you.. I want to shake her!!! She's better than this.. Or at least I thought she was.
Last but not least, I'm getting married. And I want to make it 1000% clear that he is not welcome within a mile of my wedding. I will not have him show up, get drunk, cause drama with my mother's family (who also dislike him) and my dad's side as well. With a ""split"" family this wedding is going to be painful enough without him hanging around.

I guess I just want to know if anyone has any advice on how to navigate the inevitable conversation I'll need to have with her. How do I keep my cool? How do I make her see this isn't about me not loving her as my mother, this is about him? She is welcome at my wedding, obviously, but he is not. I want to see her when I go home to visit, obviously, but I will not see him or stay in a house with him. Should I reach out to my brother? How do I make it not weird, since we aren't super close, but I am concerned about how he must be feeling? How do I make this terrible situation, a little less terrible???
Thanks in advance. Sorry for the length.


TLDR: My mother got back with her terrible ex husband. She hasn't told me, I've just seen photos on Facebook. How do I bring it up and tell her I will not be spending any time with her if he's around, and that he is not welcome at my wedding?

I&amp;#39;m so angry. I can&amp;#39;t believe she&amp;#39;d take him back. After everything he did, she&amp;#39;s taken him back with seemingly no second thoughts or mention to me. I can&amp;#39;t imagine how my brother must feel. This man was terrible to him.
I have no idea how to proceed. How to bring it up - &amp;quot;so are you back with him?&amp;quot; seems too easy, she obviously is. I want to yell, scream, tell her she&amp;#39;s a damn idiot, but I know that won&amp;#39;t work. It&amp;#39;ll just cause a shut down or &amp;quot;well fine you don&amp;#39;t have to ever talk to me because I&amp;#39;m such a failure/embarrassment/bad mother/etc&amp;quot;. But at the same time, if he&amp;#39;s living with her again then I&amp;#39;m not staying there. Full stop. If I go home to visit I will get a hotel, or stay with a friend. I will not be in the same house as him. I won&amp;#39;t even see him, I will not subject myself to that. Also my poor brother?! I want to reach out, ask him how he&amp;#39;s doing, but I&amp;#39;m not sure I&amp;#39;d get an &amp;quot;honest&amp;quot; answer. He&amp;#39;s nearly done high school, and probably planning to move out soon anyways, but to have this man around, who is not quiet about his dislike... How terrible it must feel to have your mother choose him over you.. I want to shake her!!! She&amp;#39;s better than this.. Or at least I thought she was.
Last but not least, I&amp;#39;m getting married. And I want to make it 1000% clear that he is not welcome within a mile of my wedding. I will not have him show up, get drunk, cause drama with my mother&amp;#39;s family (who also dislike him) and my dad&amp;#39;s side as well. With a &amp;quot;split&amp;quot; family this wedding is going to be painful enough without him hanging around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I just want to know if anyone has any advice on how to navigate the inevitable conversation I&amp;#39;ll need to have with her. How do I keep my cool? How do I make her see this isn&amp;#39;t about me not loving her as my mother, this is about him? She is welcome at my wedding, obviously, but he is not. I want to see her when I go home to visit, obviously, but I will not see him or stay in a house with him. Should I reach out to my brother? How do I make it not weird, since we aren&amp;#39;t super close, but I am concerned about how he must be feeling? How do I make this terrible situation, a little less terrible???
Thanks in advance. Sorry for the length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: My mother got back with her terrible ex husband. She hasn&amp;#39;t told me, I&amp;#39;ve just seen photos on Facebook. How do I bring it up and tell her I will not be spending any time with her if he&amp;#39;s around, and that he is not welcome at my wedding? How do I reach out to my brother who is caught in the middle, and still lives with her, but I am not super close to?&lt;/p&gt;

Why do I dislike him? He’s very judgmental and condescending. I can’t get through a single conversation without him coming off as narcissistic and know-it-all. Anything I say he automatically negates. 

He’s also an unsupportive piece of shit. He doesn’t support my career decision of becoming a tattoo artist and constantly puts me down for it. He never has my best interests at heart. He forces me to go to college even though I wanted to go to beauty and/or culinary school. I know it seems like he “cares for my future” but in my eyes he’s just forcing me to become something he wants rather than letting me choose my own path. I’m sorry if that college comment came off as entitled. I’m not opposed at college but I’m just not happy with the emotional implications of my father. 

There are many other things my dad is responsible for in terms of emotional damage. The list goes on so I can’t share every single thing. 
Aside from me, I don’t like the way my dad treated my mom (who is now divorced from him) and the way he treats my brother/treated him in the past. When my brother was about ten years old my dad told him “you’re never going anywhere in life” and called him “retarded” in a degrading manner along with other things. The list of things he did to my mom is also long. He allegedly cheated on her but I can’t fully take this as fact. All I know is he treated my mom very coldly and did not take part in raising me and my brother in our early years. 

Please don’t twist my words. He’s not some abusive and crazy alcoholic who beats his kids or something. He’s just a shitty dad. He’s not a bad person but he’s just not cut out to be a parent. 

Have I tried resolving things and working on our relationship? Yes. I’ve expressed all my grievances and suggestions on what he can do to make things better but he never changes. You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink the water. My dad may not be abusive but he is emotionally unavailable. In full truth, I am no longer interested in having a relationship with him. It’s toxic to me. However, I am forced to put on a facade since I’m financially dependent on him and have no means to move out. So this leads to the next question. 

How can I stop being a helpless 19 year old and take charge of my own life? What jobs should I get? How can I make a living so I don’t have to depend on my father? I NO LONGER WANT TO BE HELPLESS.

Names :

Kendra - little sister (30)

Jacob - fiance (26)

Aiden - fiancé's son from a previous marriage (six years old) 

Jessica - Kendra's daughter (seven years old) 

TLDR: the 4 of them live at my parent's house (probably because my parents try to give a much kindness to Aiden and Jessica as they can... Or something like that) 

My little sister Kendra is a narcissist. Worse, (she had bad l seizures as a child - had to relearn to speak - and was supposed to be seeing a doctor for evaluation for years but we were poor for a while and she stopped getting treatment). She has had a lifelong terrible attitude and drips venom and scorn on everything. She's also been basically tipsy to drunk on a daily basis and at every family event for the last year. 

Kendra lives with her fiance at my parents house, her fiance Jacob is an affable person but a piece of shit towards his six year old son. He and my sister cannot let this boy breathe. He only received custody of his son Aiden in the last year. Before that, Aiden lived with Jacob's ex wife. 

His ex lost custody In a court case, family services got involved because Aiden had been physically and emotionally abused... His ex would lock him in a dog kennel. She's a monster.

Aiden is a bit of a tough kid. He seems to have 'shields up' and a lot of time will not seem to hear anything said to him. He also is constantly yelled at for basically everything by Jacob and especially my piece of shit sister Kendra. (Kendra's daughter Jessica tries to get Aiden in trouble too. She's a year older than him, and has lived under Kendra her whole life)

To be fair, Aiden is remarkably resilient for all he has been through. I have never seen him do more than timidly cry/fuss a bewildered ""but why"" type of response (to the unreasonably controlling demands or put downs thrown at him). 

I want to call Kendra and Jacob a piece of shit and tell them to leave Aiden alone, but I feel like it will definitely not make things better for Aiden.

Does anyone have advice for dealing with this scenario? I don't want to not see my parents anymore because of the black holes of emotion that are Jacob and Kendra, but they drive my blood pressure through the roof. Additionally my parents try to pretend it isn't happening, and hope they can be nice enough to the children to compensate for the verbal abuse.

I&amp;#39;m the complete opposite, but have always tried to replicate some of his behaviours/activities (I started working out, got a better job, started rock climbing). 
Recently, i went through a pretty bad breakup, and realized I lost touch with A LOT of my friends. I figured I should start expanding my circle a little, and thought my brother would be a good place to start. However, the age gap, the fact that we dont really hang out much ever and differences in character, etc., I feel may get in the way initially. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could really use some help on how to approach him, asking if we could spend some time together, if he could invite me to some of his parties, something. I always wanted a brother, have one, but never really bonded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appreciate any advice. Need more info? Just ask!
Take care!&lt;/p&gt;

One day, she told us a story about her neighbor, being a nurse at the St. James Hospital (almost destroyed now), and what she witnessed.

Timeline: The past around the mid-80s.

Characters: My grandma, Friendly Nurse Neighbor, Angry Wife, and Poor Husband.

&amp;#x200B;

My grandma told us that she and her Friendly Nurse Neighbor over for tea and cookies. They were talking about the general things like the children, household, their ex-husbands, and work. Friendly Nurse Neighbor set down her tea and braced herself and told my grandma to brace herself as well for what she witnessed at her job the other day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Friendly Nurse Neighbor was doing her rounds on her shift. She said that it was busy, but not too busy where a nurse and doctor can actually sit down for a cup of coffee or water. Friendly Nurse Neighbor said she finally sat down with a cup of water in hand and drinking when the emergency alarm played. Friendly Nurse Neighbor finished her drink quickly before rushing toward the emergency doors to see the doors opening with a bleeding man (Poor Husband) on a stretcher and the EMTs beside him. The doctors and other nurses asked what happened to the Poor Husband and coming in after them was Angry Wife. Friendly Nurse Neighbor's eyes widened in shock and surprised when Angry Wife held up something into the air and screamed, ""**I TOLD YOU I'LL CUT IT OFF IF I CAUGHT YOU CHEATING ON ME!**"" The wife was holding the man's bloody manhood in her hand. 

&amp;#x200B;

My grandma nearly choke on her drink after her neighbor was done with the story. She asked if they reattached the man's manhood, and the neighbor said yes. She also said that the wife was arrested and the two are getting a divorce.

Every once In awhile I dont feel like talking or engaging. I try to stay polite about it.

My family, 2 younger sisters a mom and a dad, doesnt see it that way. They try to engage me when I'm like this and I try to be positive but they keep pushing and to be honest sometimes I snap and say something that triggers them (usually my mom.). They say that something must have put me in a bad mood and will keep asking about it. This just makes it worse. 

Dont get me wrong I like my family. However they sometimes make me doubt whether or not it's reasonable to be in a bad mood for no reason. I'm not saying I'm innocent in these situations because I'm not but I feel like as long as it doesnt negatively affect anyone else it shouldn't be a problem. 

What do you guys think I should do? Do you think it's fine to be in a bad mood for no reason? Does my family have a point? Has anyone else had the same experience? Any input would be appreciated.

I have a B.A from UCLA and currently going to law school but they are on another level with their education crap. I've had it up to here on how much importance they place on school.  Academia is almost like a marker they make sure they underline, bold, and enlarge the font when they talk about themselves or us (their children, my sister, brother and I) ...

I'm at one of the most stressful times of my life (college/uni apps) and it's recently gotten to a point where I can't stand being in the same room as them. I've tried to talk to them multiple times about their actions and reactions and how they're destructive to the conversation/solution. But before anyone responds, I need to provide some background information.

My mom was raised in the countryside in China. She lived in mild poverty (in terms of housing and clothes), but she never went hungry and was forced to learn to be independent at a young age (12-13). Because this was back in the 1980s, the Chinese still had it in their minds that boys were the more desirable gender to have. This caused her parents to neglect her and favour her younger brother. On top of that, her parents argued constantly in front of her and almost completely ignored my mom whenever she was upset or wanted to talk to them about something they disagreed with. As a result, she never learned how to deal with problems when they were to be solved vocally and even now always resorts to yelling and personal attacks. Knowing this, I understand why she behaves the way she does and I take that into account when I'm trying to talk to her. However, ever since my little brother has started causing more problems at home, school, and otherwise, she's been more irritable than I've ever seen her and my advice never seems to stick.

My little brother has a mild form of ADHD. He doesn't take medication for it as we were told it was unnecessary. He goes to the same school as me, one of which is an IB school so despite him being in the 7th grade it's still very rigorous. The school also requires everyone to have a laptop (it only has grades 7-12) so my little bro got my old one. He has a history of behavioural problems (physical altercations, offensive language, resistance to authority, etc.) but has gotten better in the past couple of years. Ever since starting grade 7 and having his own laptop, he's now started to cause problems at home (not wanting to take a break from the laptop, playing games when he shouldn't be, etc.) and at school (not submitting work or submitting work late, playing games during class, not listening to the teacher). Whenever my parents and I try to talk to him, he gets angry and refuses to acknowledge his problems. There are a lot more details to this but for the sake of time I'll leave them out.

Now, I like to consider myself a mature teen. I've learned to be aware of when to pick my fights and I try to empathize with the person on the opposite end as much as possible. I try my best to adapt the way I act and talk around them so I appear likeable. I've also recently started admitting to myself that I have been emotionally and verbally abused by my mom for as long as I could remember and that, coupled with my stress, has made me think about suicide quite often, which started when I was 11. My mental state is deteriorating and I'm emotionally drained at the end of every day. My bad mood has basically destroyed my work ethic and I no longer want to even try in school anymore.

I have suggested therapy. My mom refuses to admit she has an anger management problem and believes that having for my little brother a therapist will ""label"" him as mentally unstable and thus ruining any chances of entry to a university. My dad doesn't help either despite my constant begging of him to talk to both of them as he is level-headed himself. My older brother is gone in university and even when he comes back he barely comes downstairs.

Any suggestions on how to deal with this?

I am a 23 year old male who is quite aloof, reserved, and has a tendency to be rather forgetful. Throw in a job with irregular 12 hour day/night shifts and a 1 hour commute each way, a dash of depression, and you might figure my life is sort of a mess. This is something I hope to change in the future.

I get by with generous help from my dad. I get to rent my apartment from him at very fair price, borrow his old car to get around, and loads of advice.   

This past year, I've made some pretty dumb blunders such as missing my newborn sister's babtism due to oversleeping, missing a dinner invitation (in the evening) due to falling asleep in the afternoon, and forgetting to call my father on his birthday. All of this makes me feel very ashamed and inspires feelings of being an utter fuck up. 

Following each blunder, my father's wife has scolded me furiously, bringing up other things I need to improve on, calling me lazy and disrespectful, uncaring, selfish (that's a big one, more on that later), and that my father deserves better. I'm not certain how my dad feels. I have made it clear that I do none of this intentionally, and would never distress them on purpose.

I do understand where she is coming from, but also feel this may be somewhat of an overreaction on her part. One thing, I do take issue with.

10 years ago, my father cheated on my mother with this woman. It broke our family apart. My mother now lives in a different country with my sister, and my father is married to this woman and has two children with her. I was never told what happened, but I'm forgetful not stupid. I've never held it against my father, or even her. People are complex, and make mistakes. I have never confronted them about this, or let them on that I know why my parents divorced. I try to avoid conflict because in addition to being kind of a mess, I'm very much a human doormat (a whole different issue).

Her calling me selfish really hit a sore spot. I am afraid the next time I inevitably do something stupid, I will stutter through some variation of a piece of my mind. SHE does not get to call ME selfish after burning down my family unit and starting her own out of the ashes.

I'm just afraid this may sour my relationship with my dad, who I love very much.

&lt;p&gt;I thought a military man would take the responsibility and be a man about it. Be more understanding and caring type of person. I guess I am wrong. I guess I am not good enough for him but don&amp;#39;t want to change who i am to please someone but continue to be my authentic self. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never asked this. I never ask to be born but at the same time i&amp;#39;m grateful to be given this life even though I struggled and went through alot in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess wasted my time searching and looking for me then found out he has no interest in me. Yes, I was already prepared and aware the possibility of not going well where he might reject me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I ever want is to know my father. Bond and form a relationship with him. I&amp;#39;ve always wanted to know my father. I&amp;#39;ve always looked for him when I was a child till now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh well, I do not know what to say or do but I guess to move on knowing my father does not care and is not man enough to accept me as his child.&lt;/p&gt;

1: Berate my hair. Ms.helpful and sis #2 often do this. I'll be stepping out of the car and someone will say ""What is wrong with your hair?!"" Or ""Did you comb/brush it?"" Thanks mom and sis, because that is absolutely the first thing I wanna hear while walking into Walmart.


2:Accuse me of things I didnt do just because it seems like something I would do. I cant remember an exact example but it was extremely  frustrating when you didnt do something but get punishment for it.


3: make sis #3 the GC, mostly only my dad did this. I do remember one time when I was younger (like 8-10) and I was playing a game with sis #3 and JustNoSis. Sis #3 suddenly sat down near a corner somewhere and put a pillow to her face like she was crying. We spent like half an hour trying to get her attention so she could tell us what was wrong. Then, she lifted her pillow off of her face to reveal she wasnt even crying and was laughing instead. We were obviously sort of upset bc we spent like half of our play time dedicated to her and that happens. So me and JustNoSis storm off in anger. Like 2 seconds later Mr.SuddenHello bursts into the room and spanked us then left. We had no idea what it was for until he told us that we made her upset or something by getting mad or something like that. I dont remember the exact reason. There were a lot of times where sis #3 did crap and never got in trouble. Whereas if we said something the wrong way, were getting smacked on the butt with a belt.

A few years after my nana and papa’s wedding they decided to visit my Nana’s family in San Antonio’s Texas. While visiting family, my nana’s mother (we will call my nana’s mother granny) decides to invite her brother to hang out and meet the young couple of nana and papa. (I am sorry for all the family members but it becomes important). So granny invites her brother over to meet my papa and hang out (The brother will be referred to as William). My papa remembers that his uncle Billy lives in San Antonio as well and decided  to invite him over as well. Soon, the uncle billy arrives and my papa welcomes him inside. The second that Uncle Billy lays eyes on William he freezes. Uncle billy and William stare at each other in disbelief. Uncle Billy was the pilot, and squadron commander of a B29 bomber that flew bombing missions over Germany in world war 2. William was his navigator in World War Two. I was told that William had saved a few missions due to his quick thinking and readjustment of bombing zones that were different from maps at the time as well. He had also helped to avoid heavy flak zones that were improperly mapped as well. Without William very important bombing missions would have failed and everyone may have been killed. William was not only a great navigator but also was excellent in comparing things like topography and coordinates to map positions and correcting them. Uncle Billy recognizes this again when seeing William and made sure to tell everyone at the party how William was the best damn navigator possible and how he has made corrections to save a lot of lives and to make a lot more successful hits. Uncle billy was born  and raised in Wyoming and William in San Antonio Texas. But it gets crazier. On this bombing run only uncle Billy’s plan made it back home.

Crazy small world story I don’t know what is","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My dad’s side of the family has a long military history, and this is for both my dad’s mom (we will call her nana), and my dad’s dad (we will call him papa). A few years after my nana and papa’s wedding they decided to visit my Nana’s family in San Antonio’s Texas. While visiting family, my nana’s mother (we will call my nana’s mother granny) decides to invite her brother to hang out and meet the young couple of nana and papa. (I am sorry for all the family members but it becomes important). So granny invites her brother over to meet my papa and hang out (The brother will be referred to as William). My papa remembers that his uncle Billy lives in San Antonio as well and decided  to invite him over as well. Soon, the uncle billy arrives and my papa welcomes him inside. The second that Uncle Billy lays eyes on William he freezes. Uncle billy and William stare at each other in disbelief. Uncle Billy was the pilot, and squadron commander of a B29 bomber that flew bombing missions over Germany in world war 2. William was his navigator in World War Two. I was told that William had saved a few missions due to his quick thinking and readjustment of bombing zones that were different from maps at the time as well. He had also helped to avoid heavy flak zones that were improperly mapped as well. Without William very important bombing missions would have failed and everyone may have been killed. William was not only a great navigator but also was excellent in comparing things like topography and coordinates to map positions and correcting them. Uncle Billy recognizes this again when seeing William and made sure to tell everyone at the party how William was the best damn navigator possible and how he has made corrections to save a lot of lives and to make a lot more successful hits. Uncle billy was born  and raised in Wyoming and William in San Antonio Texas. But it gets crazier. On this bombing run only uncle Billy’s plan made it back home. Even crazier is that only two men survived this raid. Uncle billy and William were the only two to survive the raid and uncle billy crash landed on base. Both men had been best friends during the war but lost connection when the war ended. Uncle Billy’s nephew married William’s niece. If that isn’t is.

On our way there, my mom was supposed to get me some lunch because I didn't have lunch yet, so she was on her way to subway.

On our way, my mom was waiting to turn right on the road. I don't know too much about ""road words"" like freeway and highway and blah blah blah, so I'll try to explain this the best I can. The lady on the left side of the road was pressuring her to go, but my mom knew she couldn't. The lady on the left started to get angry, so she pressured her more and more, so my mom finally went. A car came speeding down to the right side of our car and SLAM! Airbags punched me in the right side of my face, and the car was just filled with airbags.

I screamed and jerked to the left right when the car slammed into us. We sat there for a brief moment breathing heavily. I expected my mom to mutter ""god damnit"" check if I'm ok, and kick the other person's @$$, but she did a thing I hadn't seen her do in a long time. She broke down crying and constantly saying ""I'm so sorry"". 

Seeing her cry was way more painful than the car crash. I love my mom so much that I brag about her, so seeing her cry just hit me like a truck rather than a tiny car. 

The lady pressuring her to drive just left the situation like she saw nothing!

When we got home, my mom checked my whole body for bruises and strains, but I knew I was ok becuase I felt no pain at all, only a minor bruise in my stomach area. She told me she feared of what **could've** happened. She was acting like I experienced a near death scenario, which I kind of did, but the car was going around 30-40 MPH, so the worst thing that could've happened to me was a ""whiplash"" on my neck.

Now she's just crying non-stop. It's been 4 hours and she's still crying. She asks me if I'm ok every 15 minutes, and whenever she talks, she sounds like she's holding in tears. I feel so bad for her!

What can I do? I've never seen her like this before, not even the time I got that one big scar on my hand!

Today, dad pointed out my insecurities about me touching my nose and then condescendingly saying ""what are you even talking about?"" I think it's important that i go into detail about this so that i can accurately look back at the situation in the future. 

How do i be a good person when i am insecure? How am i to be happy when I feel I can't trust the people around me, and not even my family. Today I said that I just want to be happy and when i said that i cried. I don't know why but all i know that this was different because for the longest time i've said things like ""I just want a nose job,"" and other 'superficial' things. 

Coming back from dinner I found myself tired of things I normally obsess about like YouTube videos with attractive people and images of pretty people in my Instagram feed. Ii wonder if i tired because i genuinely don't believe I am pretty enough or because I was just tired of even thinking about it or because I was tired or living life so sad and anxious. 

Being a girl wonder if that played into why I obsessed over my looks. Maybe it was just trading my unhappy life with something with a distraction I am not sure. The idea that looks are tied into the way you are treated in the world is one that I have tried to both reject completely and embrace completely at different points in my life. As I thought about what happened with my dad earlier I found myself remembering every mean thing he ever said, every way he made me feel worthless and all the worst parts of him that I didn't want to think about. Ii found myself getting angrier and angrier and then i thought, I don't want this, I just want to be happy. Not that I didn't wish II had those bad experiences, but rather that i wanted to let go of the hate that was growing in me and infecting me with self-loathing and hateful thoughts.

I find myself falling into a role that others put me in, like my dad who treats me like I am not smart and condescendingly compares me to his patients.

It was his phone. I went back into the bathroom, to think, and then came back out and he was in the bedroom. I said “oh hey have u seen my mom?” And he said she had left earlier.

&lt;p&gt;It was his phone. I went back into the bathroom, to think, and then came back out and he was in the bedroom. I said “oh hey have u seen my mom?” And he said she had left earlier. &lt;/p&gt;

For some reason these days he started to hate me out of the sudden.

My mother is acting weird, and I am still the burden of everyone. Sounds cliche, maybe it is, but I really wanted to let it out.

I applied to a part-time Food Service Worker seasonal job at a Yacht Club 5 days ago. They called me today saying they would like to schedule an interview tomorrow at 10:00am. I said, ""Sure."" This would be my first job. I'm 21 and never worked before due to bad Social Anxiety, but now I'm ready to start fighting my condition.

However I made a few mistakes. I told my family about it. They said, ""You've applied to a seasonal job? No you need a permanent position. Once the summer is over, you're going to be unemployed again."" I told them, ""This is something to start off with. I've applied to several other places over two weeks and this is the only place that gave me a call back. A seasonal job could lead to a permanent positon if they like me. And once this job is over, I would have some experience and references."" They said, ""If you were like 15/16 still in high school looking for a summer job, this would've been fine, but you're 21. At your age you need something permanent.""

My mother then asked me, ""Did you get the person's name who called you?"" I said, ""No I didn't."" She said, ""You always ask for a person's name."" I made a mistake there.

Also when the guy called me, he told me he had me down for a Locker Room Attendant position. I didn't apply for that position, I applied to a Food Service Worker position. I thought about correcting him, but figured I would just wait until the interview to elaborate on that. I also told them this and my brother told me, ""You should've corrected him on the phone and said you applied for the Food Service position not the Locker room position.""

Lastly, I still don't know how to drive or have a license. I put it off once again due to anxeity. My brother was going to drive me to the interview tomorrow since he's off work tomorrow. However he told me, ""You need to learn how to drive, because we cannot be driving you around everywhere you need to go. It's inconvenient for us. On my days off I want to relax, not have to worry about picking you up or dropping you off.""

I told him, ""I do want to learn how to drive and I plan on doing it this summer. I don't want you guys to drive me around anymore because it's not fair to you. I don't mind catching the bus to work and taking Uber/Lyft until I learn how to drive and get my license. I'm trying to find a job close by so I don't have a far commute. I want to find a job first before I start driving so I can pay for lessons.""

My brother said, ""Okay.""

I know I'm a bit all over the place, but I'm just a bit frustrated. I'm trying to break out of my shell and bad habits. I'm tired of wasting my life and being stuck in my parents house all day.

I know getting my first job and learning how to drive is something I should've been doing 5-6 years ago, but it's not too late. I'm still young. It's better late than never.

All in all, what do you guys think? I am going to call the job tomorrow and tell them I am no longer interested and going to continue looking for a permanent position. I still thought about going just to see what a job interview is like and just for practice. What do you think about that?

Even though I don’t have a timeline for meeting someone and starting a family, it’s hard not to feel like you’re falling behind when bombarded with the knowledge that everyone around you seems to be in a happy, stable relationship. 

I have great friends, a fulfilling job, and plenty of hobbies, but I miss being in a relationship and having someone to have tea with, or watch a movie with, or just cuddle with. Tonight I was feeling particularly down and discouraged, when out of the blue I got a call from my parents. Typically I chat with them early in the morning on weekends, so to get a call from them late evening on a weekday I assumed there was some type of emergency. 

In fact they were calling just to tell me they love me and that they’re proud of me. Having their validation and support means so much. I am a grown, independent woman in my late 20s, but their love and pride in me is so comforting. 

At one point I brought up the terrible dates I’ve had recently, and their response was that I shouldn’t rush things. Not having that pressure to have someone to bring home to my parents or give them grandkids is such a relief at times. What brought me to tears though was when they told my I was a complete person all on my own and did not need another person to complete me. When I find someone it will be a person who can be a true partner. 

I know children rarely tell their parents everything. I certainly don’t. They had no way of knowing that I was having an off day. But they were thinking of me and decided to act on it rather than wait until our regular call times. I guess what my takeaway is, it’s that if you are thinking of someone, whether it’s a family member, a friend, or someone else, don’t hesitate to reach out. Whether it’s a text or a call, it might only put a smile on their face, or it may turn their entire day around.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The past few weeks have been a little frustrating and sad for me as I’ve been on some awful dates while also getting regular updates on how great my brother’s and my best friend’s relationships are, seeing anniversary posts for married college friends, and being reminded that my parents met when they were my age.

At first, everything just fell into place. He was charming and nice at the beginning. But that all suddenly changed after marriage. You see this only happened once before I'm pretty sure, let me tell you about it. I just got out of an apartment fire and my mom and I got a new apartment(the company's name will be spared). We got our insurance money back and so we went to get all my toys back, where you might ask? ToysRus, the one and only thing I will love more than my pet lizard(Who passed away sadly) and my mom and dad. So I got a ps4 and Disney Infinity and we go home plug everything in, what do we realize? we needed a cable extender, but oh how fortunate were we when my stepdad heroically, LENT my mom an extension cord. So we plug it in, but oh no we realize that we don't have one in the bedroom anymore. So we call him, and this is his response, ""Did you know how hard it was to find that cord! It is under my bed and was so hard to reach!"" I'll spare you the details of what happened that night but let me say my mom wasn't happy, the only words I remember were, ""This is not what I signed up for!"". Saying that this isn't the man she wanted to be dating. Now let's move on 7 months. I'm at my real dad's house. \*, bring bring\* goes my phone. Hello? My mom tells me that my stepdad proposed. I'm just 9 at the time so I say. Ok. Nothing much. 1 more year passed by. They're happily married! Wow, we are gonna gave such a wonderful family right! Wrong. I do remember very vividly when I was a child. He was very sensitive and his little ears couldn't handle the sound of a door ""slamming"", but it wasn't slamming, just THE NORMAL SOUND A DOOR MAKES WHEN YOU CLOSE IT. He wasn't very happy. He said don't do it again, ok. I opened my door again to go get some water from downstairs and then go back up. Closes door once again. All I heard from downstairs. ""WHAT THE FUCK!"" Welp. This is the day I die. At first, I thought he stubbed his toe or something, but then I heard very loud steps up the stairs.  And my mom stands in my doorway. I go to hide in my closet, but I come out because I can't act scared. She says, ""I already told him"" He doesn't say a word to her. Walks right past her and yells in my face, ""WHAT THE FUCK DID I TELL YOU! STOP SLAMMING THE FUCKING DOOR"" at this point I'm in tears. He walks away. He comes back later that night and installs felt pads. When I'm 13 he comes home one night. I'm supposed to be with my dad this weekend. He sees my duffel bag which I take with me on my trips with my dad on the floor. And I'm not with him because he goes to Ecuador to see his mom 3 times a year. And it was this time of the year. I will spare the specifics but I will tell you what he did say. While I'm upstairs with my ear to the door. ""THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE OUR WEEKEND WHY THE FUCK IS HE HERE!"" ""I DONT FUCKING CARE THAT HIS DAD IS IN EQUADOR,"" My mom said something about how hard it is in Ecuador and he doesn't see his mom much. ""I DONT. FUCKING. CARE!"" I have many more stories but I'm writing this all in one night. Now I am still 13, it's 5/23/19 I am in 7th grade. And he is divorced. Now I may have spared you the specifics the whole time throughout this story because I don't feel like typing it all. But I am willing to share his personal life. Ready? Erick Weber. Alyssa Weber, his daughter. Doesn't speak to him mom much, his dad left him as a kid because Erick is just a fucking douchebag. Let me tell you something about his daughter, shall I? I may be evil for saying this but since he wasn't in work for 1 year and my mom paid off our house for all the time he was out and he didn't pay it all back, and he wants 50% for the house we are selling, fucking suck me dry. She was suicidal because she was fat and had no friends. She cut her thighs so she wouldn't die, very smart. Her mom found this and she was brought to a mental hospital. She said the following, ""LET ME OUT! LET ME OUT!"" ""I DONT BELONG IN HERE!"".

There you have it an overweight disgusting dad and an overweight disgusting pig of a daughter. Suck me dry. Try to steal our money? Burn in hell you assholes.

Hope. you. burn. in. hell.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I was about 9 years old when my dad and my mom met. At first, everything just fell into place. He was charming and nice at the beginning. But that all suddenly changed after marriage. You see this only happened once before I&amp;#39;m pretty sure, let me tell you about it. I just got out of an apartment fire and my mom and I got a new apartment(the company&amp;#39;s name will be spared). We got our insurance money back and so we went to get all my toys back, where you might ask? ToysRus, the one and only thing I will love more than my pet lizard(Who passed away sadly) and my mom and dad. So I got a ps4 and Disney Infinity and we go home plug everything in, what do we realize? we needed a cable extender, but oh how fortunate were we when my stepdad heroically, LENT my mom an extension cord. So we plug it in, but oh no we realize that we don&amp;#39;t have one in the bedroom anymore. So we call him, and this is his response, &amp;quot;Did you know how hard it was to find that cord! It is under my bed and was so hard to reach!&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;ll spare you the details of what happened that night but let me say my mom wasn&amp;#39;t happy, the only words I remember were, &amp;quot;This is not what I signed up for!&amp;quot;. Saying that this isn&amp;#39;t the man she wanted to be dating. Now let&amp;#39;s move on 7 months. I&amp;#39;m at my real dad&amp;#39;s house. *, bring bring* goes my phone. Hello? My mom tells me that my stepdad proposed. I&amp;#39;m just 9 at the time so I say. Ok. Nothing much. 1 more year passed by. They&amp;#39;re happily married! Wow, we are gonna gave such a wonderful family right! Wrong. I do remember very vividly when I was a child. He was very sensitive and his little ears couldn&amp;#39;t handle the sound of a door &amp;quot;slamming&amp;quot;, but it wasn&amp;#39;t slamming, just THE NORMAL SOUND A DOOR MAKES WHEN YOU CLOSE IT. He wasn&amp;#39;t very happy. He said don&amp;#39;t do it again, ok. I opened my door again to go get some water from downstairs and then go back up. Closes door once again. All I heard from downstairs. &amp;quot;WHAT THE FUCK!&amp;quot; Welp. This is the day I die. At first, I thought he stubbed his toe or something, but then I heard very loud steps up the stairs.  And my mom stands in my doorway. I go to hide in my closet, but I come out because I can&amp;#39;t act scared. She says, &amp;quot;I already told him&amp;quot; He doesn&amp;#39;t say a word to her. Walks right past her and yells in my face, &amp;quot;WHAT THE FUCK DID I TELL YOU! STOP SLAMMING THE FUCKING DOOR&amp;quot; at this point I&amp;#39;m in tears. He walks away. He comes back later that night and installs felt pads. When I&amp;#39;m 13 he comes home one night. I&amp;#39;m supposed to be with my dad this weekend. He sees my duffel bag which I take with me on my trips with my dad on the floor. And I&amp;#39;m not with him because he goes to Ecuador to see his mom 3 times a year. And it was this time of the year. I will spare the specifics but I will tell you what he did say. While I&amp;#39;m upstairs with my ear to the door. &amp;quot;THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE OUR WEEKEND WHY THE FUCK IS HE HERE!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I DONT FUCKING CARE THAT HIS DAD IS IN EQUADOR,&amp;quot; My mom said something about how hard it is in Ecuador and he doesn&amp;#39;t see his mom much. &amp;quot;I DONT. FUCKING. CARE!&amp;quot; I have many more stories but I&amp;#39;m writing this all in one night. Now I am still 13, it&amp;#39;s 5/23/19 I am in 7th grade. And he is divorced. Now I may have spared you the specifics the whole time throughout this story because I don&amp;#39;t feel like typing it all. But I am willing to share his personal life. Ready? Erick Weber. Alyssa Weber, his daughter. Doesn&amp;#39;t speak to him mom much, his dad left him as a kid because Erick is just a fucking douchebag. Let me tell you something about his daughter, shall I? I may be evil for saying this but since he wasn&amp;#39;t in work for 1 year and my mom paid off our house for all the time he was out and he didn&amp;#39;t pay it all back, and he wants 50% for the house we are selling, fucking suck me dry. She was suicidal because she was fat and had no friends. She cut her thighs so she wouldn&amp;#39;t die, very smart. Her mom found this and she was brought to a mental hospital. She said the following, &amp;quot;LET ME OUT! LET ME OUT!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I DONT BELONG IN HERE!&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you have it an overweight disgusting dad and an overweight disgusting pig of a daughter. Suck me dry. Try to steal our money? Burn in hell you assholes. She this to spread awareness about this fucking douchebag. Oh and also we celebrated the chinese new year. Alyssa didn&amp;#39;t come, but she still got money right? Yesssss. But she won&amp;#39;t be receiving help on buying her a new car or any more red envelopes you fucking faggot. I&amp;#39;ll update this post to see what happens with this divorce.

I (18f) have always had troubles with my mum. We both suffer from depression and are both seeking separate counselling and both on antidepressants. However she's always made me worse. Me and my boyfriend (now ex) used to have so many arguments because of her and the was she treated me.

Some people might say that it's nothing compared to what others have to go through, however it's killing me. If I try to sit down and tell her she cries and we end up having a screaming match and nothing changes. If I say that I'd rather stay at home instead of go out with her, she gets upset then won't talk to me. I can't even go sit upstairs in my bedroom without her making me feel guilty that I've left her downstairs on her own. We've got 2 Guinea pigs, I asked for them as I hated being left on my own in the house for days on end with no company.

Im currently on Sertraline and I'm doing so much better than I was last year. However...

She keeps calling me fat. I've been going to the gym now for 8 months, and have put on 6 lb in muscle. I had to undo my jeans in the car yesterday because I couldn't breath and the way I was sitting was digging in. And she called me fat and told me to stop eating so much. She called me fat again today when I said I couldn't get into my Size 10 Jeans anymore. And I can't say anything because she'll just cry.

There was so much pressure on me for college, as my grades started to slip and she was guilt tripping me into working harder by not telling my dad. If I booked a day off work for studies, she would get annoyed.

I'm hoping to move out in the next year, and terrified of telling her. I've had to force her to go see a counselor because I can't deal with the guilt of leaving my 13 year old brother to have to help her. She's so over protective and I've had to stop telling her about parts of my life, and I've been lying for the last 8 months about who I've been with and where I am.

As a young child I had a stepdad that was abusive in every way except sexually. He abused me and my sister daily and treated us with less dignity than a bug, we were absolutely mortally terrified of him and I recall crying myself to sleep most nights at around the age of 8. When my mum broke up with him he came to our house threatening to kill us so we moved far away and stayed with my nan for a while. 

Soon after arriving back in our home town my mum met another guy, married him and had a kid with him within the space of a year. He is my current stepdad and my mum has been with him for 8 years. I have so many issues with him. First of all he's narcissistic, selfish, extremely irritable, he's a bully and a hypocrite. Those are all the first things that immediately come to mind. I'm 18 and currently there are 5 kids in the house and one of them is his although my mum is pregnant with another. She will have had 6 kids with 3 different dads and each group of kids don't really get on. 

My stepdad will shout and swear at me for literally anything, and just as she did when I was little my mum will defend him and say ""that's just the way he is."" And that I can never expect an apology for his behaviour. When I was 16 he got in my face and threatened me and recently it's been getting on my nerves when he treats us all like dirt except his own son who he coddles and promises to buy him toys and games whenever he's throwing a tantrum. I recall a few weeks ago our dog jumped up at my mum and I said to her ""don't give eye contact and he will learn to not jump up and leave you alone"" and all of a sudden he looks up from his phone and shouts ""DON'T FUCKING TELL YOUR MUM WHAT TO DO."" Which really hurt me because I wasn't trying to command her or anything, I was more offering a suggestion/advice. He sees us all as a hindrance and it's so obvious that he dislikes us. He's so fuxking horrible to my sister and talks shit about my real dad despite not having any reason or right to. He's one of those people that thinks that just because he's ""man of the house"" that he can treat people like vermin and expect everyone to do exactly as he commands and respect him. He regularly upsets my mum and makes her cry and then acts like a child and messages my mum saying hes running away to his parents house despite actually just being parked round the corner from our house whenever they have an argument. he didn't even support her when my grandad died. He genuinely is so self centred and I don't respect him, how could? I know less about him than I would a stranger on the street, all I know is that he's an absolute prick. I even hate how he acts to my siblings that I don't particularly get on with because he can be so cruel and nasty.

For everyone's sake I wish him and my mum would get a divorce because it's so horrible having to live with him and I can't afford to move out despite him wanting me to.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will be a decently long post, you don&amp;#39;t have to read it all but I would appreciate any input.&lt;/p&gt;

Now that I am grown (20), the idea of ever having to rely on others for essential things, gives me anxiety. When I needed people to do things for me as a child, they either couldn't do it, wouldn't do it, or felt as though they owned me and could treat me like shit for doing it. 

I never ask people for money. Whenever or if I need a favor from someone, I always pay them. I never ask for freebies. 

I do everything myself, pay my own bills (phone, food, rent, utilities, credit card, clothes, etc). I am always making sure that I get into a profession (nursing), that will gurantee that I will never need anyone financially and for other essential things.

&lt;p&gt;Now that I am grown (20), the idea of ever having to rely on others for essential things, gives me anxiety. When I needed people to do things for me as a child, they either couldn&amp;#39;t do it, wouldn&amp;#39;t do it, or felt as though they owned me and could treat me like shit for doing it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never ask people for money. Whenever or if I need a favor from someone, I always pay them. I never ask for freebies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do everything myself, pay my own bills (phone, food, rent, utilities, credit card, clothes, etc). I am always making sure that I get into a profession (nursing), that will gurantee that I will never need anyone financially and for other essential things. &lt;/p&gt;

Our ages are 28, 25, 21, and 19; I'll refer to us by ages. 

28 lives with my mother after leaving and divorcing her own husband a year ago, moved in there with the guy she left her exhusband for, not ever paying rent, never actually asking if she could move in, just assuming. My boyfriend and I were renting part of 28's basement for half a year, I asked my mother if I could move in since 28's exhusband was kicking me out, and we offered to pay rent. 19 and her now husband moved out just before I moved in; 28's behavior made them so uncomfortable that they felt forced into buying their own home, they were mostly staying there in the first place to help my mother by paying rent. 28 moved in 2-3 months before I did, her exhusband wanted to wait until we were done with spring semester before kicking us out (kindly enough, even though I only passed 1 out of 3 classes due to the stress of the situation of finding a place to live). 28 was a horrible ""landlord"", left passive agressive notes around the house, even left a note on the bathroom mirror saying, ""it's flu season, wash your goddamn hands."" Meaning she was listening into my boyfriend's noises in the bathroom enough to know he doesn't wash his hands after taking a piss, which is fairly common for guys not to do? I have plenty of other examples, but that one just takes the cake. They made us uncomfortable as well, she spread gossip to all of our family and friends about how much of a horrible person my boyfriend is, basically that he's lazy and makes me do everything for him. She actually thought that he'd illegally drive my car without a license at night, when he was actually being picked up by friends but she was to lazy to look out the window to confirm it. When I first moved into my mother's, I found out 28 had taken my TV out of my old bedroom at my mother's. I took it back, and had to look around for the remote, which was in the bedside table drawer. She decided it was wrong of me to violate her privacy by going into her room to take those back, when she didn't get permission to take it in the first place, and decided to fight with me about it, attacking mine and my boyfriend's character, and then ending the argument with ""you better get your shit together and get out."" She's been living there with her boyfriend, rent free, for about 15 months. She took over the place the moment she moved in, and changes things in the house without asking my mother. She's even taken over the garage with her shit from divorce, instead of getting a storage unit, selling it, or moving tf out. I finally moved out of my mother's after 5 months, paying rent, and staying in my bedroom for the majority of my time spent there. 28 takes over the whole house, basically. She has a living area, with a couch and tv, in her own room, yet she spends most of her time at home in the living room with her boyfriend. I could never be in there, or in the neighboring kitchen, unless she wasn't home. This forced my boyfriend and I to spend a lot of money eating fast food. We also had one small cabinet for food and no fridge space, unless we shoved something in the crisper drawer. She'd purposely fall asleep on the couch instead of going to bed so she could keep tabs of people coming and going. She makes my mother and her boyfriend uncomfortable in their own home as well and are barely home when 28 and her boyfriend are, but my mother has let 28 walk all over her for far too long.

My mother's boyfriend, S, moved into her home the summer I stayed there. She has been with him for a couple years, unofficially even before then as 'friends' before my parents officially separated. He had just spent a year in jail for an OWI, with weed I assume. My mother still dated him the entire time, constantly visiting him like every weekend. I think he's a genuinely nice guy, I've had a couple chats with him. 28 decided that she didn't like him, and the first week he was there, she noticed one of her anxiety pills was missing, and blamed S for it. She's talked shit about being a drug addict him ever since. I recently found out from 19 that 28's boyfriend confessed to S that he was the one who took the pill, but never told 28 about it. S is on probation and his license is suspended, so he had some trouble finding a job straight out of prison. He eventually got a good paying job painting houses through 25's husband, helped my mom pay for a lot of things, including a new water heater. He hurt his back, on the job I think, only a couple months after he started. He's in severe pain constantly, he's been to several doctors and the hospital many times, but most of them couldn't find a problem, and wrote him off as a drug seeker. I think he found one recently that believes him, but he isn't receiving treatment yet. My mother has basically been supporting a family of four on her own for a year. She's got medical bills of her own and regular bills and was paying for weed and alcohol for her boyfriend to self medicate when doctors weren't believing him. She's constantly stressed over money; she's even had to dip into her retirement to be able to pay bills. 28's boyfriend paid one bill, ONCE. Apparently 28's paid half of the gas bill recently, but that's the only thing they've ever contributed. 28 has student loan debt and her bf has some debt apparently too, but they are definitely capable of paying rent and utilities and have done so for years before taking advantage of my mother. My mother should have forced them to pay something a long time ago, but she's really bad at confrontation and shuts down in arguments. 28 should have been offering to pay rent anyways, 19 and I both offered to the entire time we stayed there.

Recently, the day before mother's day, a shit storm rained down. My mother got her nails done with 28, 25, and 25's kids, and went shopping after. They came home, and 19 a planned on coming over to pick up some baby stuff my mom got her, 19's in her second trimester. 19 and 25's spouses had just gone fishing, and stopped by as well, unannounced to my mother. She felt as if she had to entertain everyone, and she hadn't planned on it. S is basically secluded in their room the whole night, as 28's gossip of him being an addict bum has made everyone dislike him and he is uncomfortable being around any of my family except for me and my boyfriend. After everyone left, my mom and S get into an argument. He let's out everything that's been bothering him, and my mom shuts down, doesn't want to talk. S is hurt, he brings up my mom not being divorced yet, which gives him a lot of anxiety, money problems, the fact that she's struggling so much financially with no help while she supports 2 grown ass babies that buy steaks and order expensive shit online and rule the whole house. She shuts down and doesn't want to talk. I guess at one point that night she took sleeping pills and is so tired she just wants to sleep and nothing else. 28 decides it would be a great idea to get involved and call the cops. My mom and S have to talk to this cop and convince him that there isn't a domestic violence situation happening, and S is very lucky he wasn't arrested because he is still on probation. My mother is pissed of at 28, tells her she needs to move out. There was no screaming, no violence, no throwing things, no threats, there was no reason to call the cops except to have S arrested. 28 wants S out of the house because he threatens her free ride and ruling of the house. She convinces 25 that my mom is in an abusive/toxic relationship and that he's using her. S is so hurt that night that my mom won't communicate with him over getting a solution to the problems in their relationship that he tells my mom that it's over. He packs his stuff up early morning, like 5 am. 28 asks 25 to have her husband move S out. 

I visited my mother late at night after I get out of work, at 11. I don't stay long because she's exhausted from being kept up all night and with everything going on. I wasn't told anything about last night except that they got into a fight and that he moved out that morning, not mentioning that they had broken up or anything. She had even told me that she was visiting him right before I came over.

Over the next couple days, I see some posts on Facebook from my mom and 25 that were a little strange, but I try to stay out of family drama so I didn't say anything. My mother making a vague post that she can make her own decisions, she doesn't tell you how to live your life, she's a grown woman. 25 shared stupid toxic relationship relatable shit, even made her own of #fucktoxicrelationships #saveyourself #sorrynotsorry. I didn't see any from 28 because I unfriended her months ago, but I'm told from 19 that she shared similar stuff to 25. 

Four days after shit storm, my mother messaged me asking if I was working, I said I wasn't, and she called me and we had a really emotional phone call. She asked me if I saw what was going on on Facebook, what 25 was posting, and I said yeah but I don't know what's going on. She tells me everything that happened that night, and then tearfully asked me to not like the things that 25 was posting. That is so fucking sad to me. How fucked of a daughter do you have to be, to only believe the lies of your narcissistic sister than to actually ask your mother what is happening? She just believes 28 so blindly it's disgusting. My mother is so hurt by her daughters' actions. I'm so glad she can find comfort in me. I tell her how 28's given me similar treatment, has talked so much shit about me and my boyfriend, tried to drive a wedge in between us and make my family dislike the both of us. Months ago, My bf actually gave me an ultimatum to either stand up to my family and show that I care enough to defend him, or he's done. I did that then, I told my mother that he's received harsh treatment from her for ""not helping out"". I was locked out of my car at her house one night, he was holding a flashlight for me and looking up ways to break in on his phone and she accused him of playing a game on his phone without really thinking about how it'd affect him. He was very hurt. I told her about it and she apologized. He's so done with my family that he refuses to go to family outings with me unless it's just my mom and S. I told her that the same thing was essentially happening with S, he's done with not being defended and treated poorly by my family; she needs to stick up for herself and for him. She agrees, she says she'd be talking to him later that night. I offered to message S and let him know that I don't believe the lies that 28's been spreading, and that he's a great guy in my eyes. She said she'd be really thankful for that, that S has been really depressed and anxious and has talked about suicide. S was really grateful that I reached out to him and told me that I'd always be in his heart, no matter what happens with him and my mom. 

5 days later, hours ago actually, I receive a group message including my other sisters from 25, essentially saying ""S's parole officer says that he will go to jail if he doesn't stop seeing Mom, and I (25) and 28 have decided not to talk to mom until that happens, we wanna know if you will to?"" 19 replies that she's ""not going to ruin her relationship with our mom over something that isn't her business, it's her decision to date him."" Which is a rational reply from anyone that isn't a fucking piece of human garbage that decides to get involved in other people's relationships. 19 privately messages me, ""why do we have nosey sisters"", and I reply that I'm fed up and about to block them. We talk a little about what actually has happened, she talked to our mom 3 days ago about it too. I tell my mother about the group message and she says that him being arrested for seeing her is completely false. I post my reply to the group chat and leave the group. 

""I refuse to believe anything you, (your husband), (28), or (28's bf) have to say about anything, basically. How about you grow the hell up and stay out of mom's business unless she asks you for help. She didn't ask for any one of you to be involved in her relationship. Calling the cops and having him removed from the house really wasn't up to any of you, only up to mom, and from what I've heard, she didn't ask for any of it. You're being super toxic children, and hurting your relationship with her. She isn't being abused, and even if she was, you're treating the situation completely wrong. Shaming her into leaving him? That's just going to alienate yourself farther from her. Brutally honest? Not really, just a narcissistic piece of shit. I hate the shit you post, I hate your attitude towards Mom and myself. Leave her and me the fuck alone.""

19 told me that 25 had 'like' reacted my comment. We talk back and fourth about the situation a little, talk about how 25 has said she would tell her husband to talk to 19's husband about helping out more around the house. 19 replied ""you know nothing about our relationship so stay out of our business!"" And nothing was ever said after that. 25 had also touched my bf on the nose and said ""once youuuuu start helping out"", referring to us unpacking after moving, when she also knew nothing at all about our relationship. Also talked  about how horrible 28 was to live with, and that we avoided being home at all so we didn't have to interact with 28. 19 and I are planning on having dinner at her home for our mom in two days for her birthday, and neither of our older sisters are invited.

I guess I'm not really asking for advice, but if you want to give any, that'd be cool. I don't plan on communicating with 28 or 25 voluntarily ever again unless they properly apologize and act like rational humans, and I plan on showing my mother endless support and encouragement to get through this. I just kind of wanted to share my story cause this situation has been bothering me for awhile.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have two older sisters and one younger sister, and the two eldest are too involved in my mother&amp;#39;s romantic relationship. Our ages are 28, 25, 21, and 19; I&amp;#39;ll refer to us by ages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;28 lives with my mother after leaving and divorcing her own husband a year ago, moved in there with the guy she left her exhusband for, not ever paying rent, never actually asking if she could move in, just assuming. My boyfriend and I were renting part of 28&amp;#39;s basement for half a year, I asked my mother if I could move in since 28&amp;#39;s exhusband was kicking me out, and we offered to pay rent. 19 and her now husband moved out just before I moved in; 28&amp;#39;s behavior made them so uncomfortable that they felt forced into buying their own home, they were mostly staying there in the first place to help my mother by paying rent. 28 moved in 2-3 months before I did, her exhusband wanted to wait until we were done with spring semester before kicking us out (kindly enough, even though I only passed 1 out of 3 classes due to the stress of the situation of finding a place to live). 28 was a horrible &amp;quot;landlord&amp;quot;, left passive agressive notes around the house, even left a note on the bathroom mirror saying, &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s flu season, wash your goddamn hands.&amp;quot; Meaning she was listening into my boyfriend&amp;#39;s noises in the bathroom enough to know he doesn&amp;#39;t wash his hands after taking a piss, which is fairly common for guys not to do? I have plenty of other examples, but that one just takes the cake. They made us uncomfortable as well, she spread gossip to all of our family and friends about how much of a horrible person my boyfriend is, basically that he&amp;#39;s lazy and makes me do everything for him. She actually thought that he&amp;#39;d illegally drive my car without a license at night, when he was actually being picked up by friends but she was to lazy to look out the window to confirm it. When I first moved into my mother&amp;#39;s, I found out 28 had taken my TV out of my old bedroom at my mother&amp;#39;s. I took it back, and had to look around for the remote, which was in the bedside table drawer. She decided it was wrong of me to violate her privacy by going into her room to take those back, when she didn&amp;#39;t get permission to take it in the first place, and decided to fight with me about it, attacking mine and my boyfriend&amp;#39;s character, and then ending the argument with &amp;quot;you better get your shit together and get out.&amp;quot; She&amp;#39;s been living there with her boyfriend, rent free, for about 15 months. She took over the place the moment she moved in, and changes things in the house without asking my mother. She&amp;#39;s even taken over the garage with her shit from divorce, instead of getting a storage unit, selling it, or moving tf out. I finally moved out of my mother&amp;#39;s after 5 months, paying rent, and staying in my bedroom for the majority of my time spent there. 28 takes over the whole house, basically. She has a living area, with a couch and tv, in her own room, yet she spends most of her time at home in the living room with her boyfriend. I could never be in there, or in the neighboring kitchen, unless she wasn&amp;#39;t home. This forced my boyfriend and I to spend a lot of money eating fast food. We also had one small cabinet for food and no fridge space, unless we shoved something in the crisper drawer. She&amp;#39;d purposely fall asleep on the couch instead of going to bed so she could keep tabs of people coming and going. She makes my mother and her boyfriend uncomfortable in their own home as well and are barely home when 28 and her boyfriend are, but my mother has let 28 walk all over her for far too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother&amp;#39;s boyfriend, S, moved into her home the summer I stayed there. She has been with him for a couple years, unofficially even before then as &amp;#39;friends&amp;#39; before my parents officially separated.

So I came back home from college, and my room smells like smoke. Like non-stop it smells like smoke, and my family has been asking me why it smells like smoke, and well I actually don't know why. I've been cleaning my room and I made a homemade diffuser, which I tried to burn tea leaves in, which didn't work and made the room smell a lot worse. My sister is at home studying for her USMLE exam and has been caught in the middle of taking care of my mom and dad ( which is a whole another problem). So my sister has been asking me why my room smells like smoke, to which I said I don't know and the time I burnt tea leaves I was trying to hide my embarrassment and told her I don't know. Long story short she finds the diffuser and my mom sees it and because it smells like smoke she loses her shit. She asks me about it right before we go to the mosque, I'm kinda taken aback and don't respond for a sec. Which she interprets as me thinking about a lie and I think to talk to her after the mosque, but she is livid. I tried to talk to her today and she is still livid. So what do I do? I mean I'm throwing out the diffuser and all my lighters and anything that would give credence to the idea that I smoke. The worst part of all of this is that I'm doing everything I can right, I'm fasting, I'm not cursing, I'm applying for internships, I'm going out for job interviews, I'm praying five times a day, and I'm doing everything else in my power not to piss her or my dad off, but this happens. Also I can't buy weed at all, like there are no dispos around me, I don't have a medical marijuana card, I'm not 21, and I don't own a fake id. also literally none of my friends can get me weed, so even if i wanted to, I can't.

Ever since we were young, my parents stressed the importance of obtaining a college education. They generously promised that they would foot the bill for our ***undergraduate degree***\*,\* and that any subsequent cost for master or doctorate degrees would be our own responsibility.

I applied to and was accepted to a ""Top 10"" (US rankings) university, along with my flagship state school (still a very respectable university) with a partial scholarship. My parents strongly encouraged that I attend the ""Top 10"" school, believing that the connections and perceived ""prestige"" from the university would be worth the cost. I did end up attending the ""higher-ranked"" school, but the cost of attendance totaled upwards of $240,000. To help offset this cost, I applied to every scholarship available, bringing the cost of attendance down to approximately $160,000.

My sister is currently applying to college. The only acceptance she received was from our flagship state school, and she was offered the same partial scholarship I had been offered. My parents will gladly pay the remaining balance, which is approximately $80,000. My sister, however, argues that they should pay another $80,000 for any subsequent master or graduate program she wishes to attend.

My parents disagree, countering that the promise was to cover the cost of a ***degree***\*,\* not to give each child the same amount of money. However, they do feel somewhat guilty because they are paying for her half of what they paid for me.

So, Reddit, which method is more fair? Give each kid equal amounts of money, or equal levels of education?

&amp;#x200B;

ETA: I understand that how my parents choose to spend their money is none of my business. My sister is upset that she didn't get into a ""better"" school and believes that the money is fair compensation. I strongly disagree, but I'll respect my parents' decision.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This question came up during a disagreement between my parents and my younger sister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since we were young, my parents stressed the importance of obtaining a college education. They generously promised that they would foot the bill for our &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;undergraduate degree&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;*,* and that any subsequent cost for master or doctorate degrees would be our own responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I applied to and was accepted to a &amp;quot;Top 10&amp;quot; (US rankings) university, along with my flagship state school (still a very respectable university) with a partial scholarship. My parents strongly encouraged that I attend the &amp;quot;Top 10&amp;quot; school, believing that the connections and perceived &amp;quot;prestige&amp;quot; from the university would be worth the cost. I did end up attending the &amp;quot;higher-ranked&amp;quot; school, but the cost of attendance totaled upwards of $240,000. To help offset this cost, I applied to every scholarship available, bringing the cost of attendance down to approximately $160,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sister is currently applying to college. The only acceptance she received was from our flagship state school, and she was offered the same partial scholarship I had been offered. My parents will gladly pay the remaining balance, which is approximately $80,000. My sister, however, argues that they should pay another $80,000 for any subsequent master or graduate program she wishes to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents disagree, countering that the promise was to cover the cost of a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;degree&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;*,* not to give each child the same amount of money. However, they do feel somewhat guilty because they are paying for her half of what they paid for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Reddit, which method is more fair? Give each kid equal amounts of money, or equal levels of education?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

Sweet as can be.  She loves to draw, color and make videos with her stuffed animals.  She's really into make believe and I love every single thing about that.  But I feel bad for her in so many ways.

  Aside from me, I feel she's been robbed of men in her life.  Her grandfather (my wife's dad) died about 4 years ago when she was 5.  He was a good man and treated her and all his grand kids with love and respect.  My father is a good person but very stand-offish with her.  He wanted us to have a son.  And since we didn't, he doesn't seem to want much to do with her.  My brother is a bit of a jerk.  He wanted nothing to do with my family because my wife was the reason that our ""party"" days stopped.  And he didn't want that.  So anything that has anything to do with my wife or daughter, he loathes it.  And my brother-in-law is rarely around.  

  I know how important it is for a young girl to have good strong male role models in her life.  And I know that I am the most important male role model she has, being her dad.  But I just feel sad for her because she's really never had that opportunity.  That grandfather who jokes with her and talks with her as she grows up, that goofy uncle who plays pranks or jokes on her, etc.

  She doesn't seem to mind, though.  She's pretty strong-willed.  She loves her immediate family so much and that seems to be all that really matters to her.  She's caring and compassionate but she's also there for those who are there for her.  I know...She's 9 years old.  lol But she takes after her mom when it comes to inner strength and mental strength.  She takes after me when it comes to empathy and compassion.  I'm proud of her for having both.

  Sometimes it just feels like weight on my shoulders.  I'm 38 years old and the thought of death pops into my head a whole lot more than it did 15-20 years ago.  And if something was to happen to me, who would step up and teach her how to love herself and find strength in herself that she would need to find the right man in her life?  Mothers teach their daughters these things too.  Don't get me wrong.  But the job of the father is to teach her what a real man is.  And his job is to also teach her to accept the beauty she possesses.  Both inside and out.  By encouraging her, loving her, uplifting her, praising her, teaching her right from wrong, encouraging her, pushing her to do what she loves.  And I feel there's a difference in the teachings between the mother and the father with these things.  Both are vital.  So I just worry that if I'm gone, she won't have that male role model in her life to lift her up.

  Anyway, just felt like sharing my story a little.  Anyone else relate?  Or have anything to add?  I appreciate it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My daughter is 9 years old.  Sweet as can be.  She loves to draw, color and make videos with her stuffed animals.

My sister (f 50) wants me to give back my smart watch that she bought me as a Christmas gift. I plan on selling it for $100 so I can pay some of my bills. I haven’t used this watch in a year because my boyfriend had bought me a new iPhone in May of last year. And this last Christmas my boyfriend had bought me a Apple Watch and as soon as I told my sister about it she asked me for my galaxy watch back for her boyfriend’s phone (that isn’t even a Samsung phone). I am a struggling almost 20 year old. I really do need the money I will be getting if I sell it but I don’t want to be on bad terms with my sister.

&lt;p&gt;So s1 randomly came into town. My mom and step-dad are pissed, I’m pissed and in pain, and s2 is following s1 around like a lost puppy. Apparently s1, her husband, and her husband’s mom are coming for dinner tomorrow night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, I have also have a procedure. It’s a blood patch, to help with the spinal headache that I’ve dealt with for the past four days as a result of a spinal tap. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;s1 hasn’t texted me at all in the past seven months other than holidays. She texted me last week saying hi, asking about my head, etc. but it was very insincere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already know what I’ll be doing while they’re over for dinner. I am going to be in bed and reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pissed. I want to be upfront and honest about how she’s acting, but I know it wouldn’t do a thing. I am in-touch with my emotions, and very sensitive and empathetic. I show my emotions easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How blunt and sassy should I be? I feel like I need emotion relief.&lt;/p&gt;

I  need some advice and possibly second opinions on what i should do with my situation. My parents and I havent gotten along since I started my relationship with my partner. My partner and I consider eachother endgame, but my parents dont agree with the relationship solely because of the race of my partner which makes me absolutely disgusted with them. 

This along with the fact that my parents, namely my mom, are the cause of my anxiety which leads to depression has pushed me to the point of wanting to disown them and start a new life without them around. Our most recent argument started because I did not follow a curfew I didnt know I had. I am 20 and the past 8 to 9 months I was at college without a curfew and even when I came back for winter break I did not have a curfew. I did during the summer before I left for school, but I understood it because of the fact that I had not been away from home my freahman year of college. The only reason the curfew is placed now is because my partner is in the area and I want to visit them when Im free. 

I hadnt had a curfew for so long I dont want to go back to having one just because they are against the race of my partner. I tried to make myself pretend to be okay with their racism and be okay with the curfew just so we can have an okay summer, but I cannot make myself stand by such a disgusting mindset. I keep trying to but I just cannot. 

My mom has gaslit me about things shes said as well as use emotional blackmail and manipulation. My dad has just been very passive agressive and only concerned about his image in his community which would view him in a negative way if they knew my partner and I were together, or so he feels. I dont know his community as much so I cannot say that it will happen. 

I am at the point where i want to permanently break myself away from them and start a new life away from them. The issue is that they forced themselves to pay for college when I didnt want them to and refuse to cosign for a loan. I want ro graduate from college, but I also made the mistake of picking a college with mandatory on campus housing which would put me in further debt with interest pilling up if I am even able to get a loan. Not only that but I dont own a car, I dont have enough for health insurance, car insurance if I do ever get a car, and no place to live during the summer if I start detatching now. I plan to get a basic flip phone plan from Verizon because its only $5 a month. Ive tried so hard to make things okay with them, but they won't change. Ive tried to be respectful of their culture and put up with them, but I cannot just let their racist beliefs slide anymore. They want me to be with someone of the same race and religion as when when i dont identify with the religion or even the culture because of the environment I grew up it. I love my partner and we have no intention of leaving eachothers lives.

My older brother has been married to his wife for about 8 years, they now have three children. My brother and I have always been close and I've had a pretty good relationship with his wife for years but we have always had differing opinions on a lot of stuff and we butt heads frequently. I come from a VERY big family where we fight one day and get over it the next - I've become very disassociated with relating emotions to arguments and disagreements because of that. My sister in law is very emotional and sensitive and comes from basically the opposite upbringing, and my brother has even said how much adjusting he's had to do to deal with issues with her as they've been married.

So in November, as I always do, I went to set up our adult sibling gift exchange via our family Facebook group to get a count of who would be participating for Christmas. My sister in law suggested that we include the children of the siblings (not just hers but all my other siblings children), to which I said I preferred to keep it adults as we have always had, and my mother and a few sisters agreed and suggested a grand kid gift exchange instead. After some discussion, I said something along the lines of, ""I don't think i'll participate if the children are involved, but i'd be happy to still coordinate it and be there when it takes place."" My sister in law apparently thought that meant I hated her children and didn't want them involved in anything. She didn't mention it to me, I never saw her posting anything about it, my brother didn't mention it to me, and soon to find out months later she refused to do a gift exchange at all because of what I said.

&amp;#x200B;

So now we are in May, and her and I still have not spoken, but I've seen my nieces and nephews many times and my brother here and there, and she has me blocked on social media. I don't feel sorry for what I said or how I said it, but I do feel sorry that she was upset and hurt by the way I said it. It has taken me some time but I sent her a message and my brother on Friday basically stating what I just said - i'm sorry that she was upset by what I said and I want to move forward. My brother then indicated to me that she would be open to moving on if I accepted responsibility and said I was sorry for what I said, which I will not do. I feel like I've done my part, and I don't think I need to say sorry for something i'm not sorry for saying. Am I in the wrong here?

I've a tad bit cause of concern.
My gf has mentioned on various occasions that her mother's bf has made her very uncomfortable saying things such as ""i wouldn't be here if it weren't for you."", my gf stated that comment weirded her out, she thought it creepy as he is dating her mother, for her to voice that to me and state it really weirded her out says a lot, as she's not big on talking.

Keep in mind my gf and her mother are very passive, unassertive people. The one day i was over her mother's bf was hugging her extra long and my gf gave me a ""help me"" look. I could only stand there and smile stupidly as her family was around. I do not want to get involved.
My gf is a very introverted, sweet woman, who has obvious self esteem issues and past traumas and can be very very timid about matters and speaking her mind.
 Her mother doesn't work and her bf is always taking my gf out to ""help"" with random machinery chores and to eat. My gf has voiced to me it makes her nervous and anxious to eat in public and her mother's bf always takes her to eat inside places. The only problem with that is my gf has social anxiety bad and freaks out as her mom's bf ""eats very slow and picks seating where everyone can see them"".
My gf knows nothing about machinery and it seems odd that her mother's bf would take her instead of her mother. Her mother doesn't work and is in excellent physical shape. He also made a comment jokingly for her mother to take off her shirt, so i take it maybe the mother is giving him blue balls; a man has needs. Her mother seems to ignore her bfs attempts at affection and my gf is hot.

As for her mother's bf, he seems like a really awesome guy. He always gives me a pat on the back or man hug and makes me feel accepted.

My concern is that my gf is so introverted and shy I'm not sure what else she's keeping bottled up or wouldn't say. Her mother's bf calls her ""breezy."" as a nickname, which means a ""broad"" or ""easy broad"" and he does this with no shame. I let my gf know the meaning and she was ill at ease. She is very much a people pleaser type and is attractive, she's just not assertive at all, which makes her a ""perfect victim.""

I honestly don't know what to make of all this. My gf is 34 yrs yet she's some setbacks.

It's certainly odd her mother's bf spends so much time with her, when her mom is free and doesn't work. Her mother is also a very passive type of person, in denial to the point my gf's older sister refuses to have anything to do with their family stating they are ""dysfunctional"" from past traumas.

What should i do? I do really like her mother's bf, as he's a really kind man. However my gf knows that and has stopped voicing when he makes her feel uncomfortable as much.

Please, advice is needed. I do not want to see her victimized.
I'm not sure what to make of this. It seems more appropriate for her mother's bf to take my gf's brother (2 yrs younger) or her mother to ""help"" with machinery. My gf is very feminine and doesn't even drive a car, let alone know how to work on tractors. Her brother could really benefit from such things.

Normally i wouldn't even post this, yet do to the comments my gf has made several different times about her mother's bf making her uncomfortable, I'm wondering if i am the naive one.
Also it is important i do not get in the middle of family drama.

To provide in a little context: my father has a serious drinking problem. As a result, my mother finally (after 20 toxic years) decided to end her relationship, and move my siblings and herself to a new house. In the weeks that followed, my father managed to loose his drivers license, get arrested, and probably loos his GP practice as well. This is the 'stressful' situation I referred to. 

&amp;#x200B;

Although my mother says she can handle it, I notice how she suffes; emotionally as well as physically. She won't ask for it, but I help wherever I can. My siblings notice how the situation is dealt with more directly when I get involved and they seem to have more faith in a solution when I am around. I also notice how my mother can focus more on the things which are important when I am involved, however, there is something blocking her from acknowledging that. This is what frustrates me. 

&amp;#x200B;

She and I have very different opinions on how to handle things like the up-coming divorce, police involvements, the interference of family members, etc. This makes us clash a lot lately, and within those clashes she seems to forget that we as children have a say in this matter too. Moreover, she seems to forget any earlier situations in which I helped out, and in which my involvement turned out for the better. Simply every perspective that is different to that of her own is seen as an 'attack' on the way she handles things. She gets very defensive every time we discuss these kind of things, and every time we end up fighting. This hurts me a lot, because my mother and I have been through some traumatic shit together, and we have bonded on a very deep level. Therefore, I worry a lot about her, also when its not necessary. This makes me the one who always apologizes after a fight or intense discussion: I just don't want to loose her. However, today I put my foot down.

&amp;#x200B;

After yet another fight in which she accuses me of an attack and I accuse her of being unnecessarily defensive, I told her I do not want any contact anymore until she apologizes to me. I want her to take the initiative for once, but it hurts like hell and I can barely resist the urge to pick up the phone. The idea that something might happen to her and the last thing I said to her was in an angry tone tears my mind apart.

This hurts me a lot, because my mother and I have been through some traumatic shit together, and we have bonded on a very deep level. Therefore, I worry a lot about her, also when its not necessary. This makes me the one who always apologizes after a fight or intense discussion: I just don&amp;#39;t want to loose her. However, today I put my foot down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After yet another fight in which she accuses me of an attack and I accuse her of being unnecessarily defensive, I told her I do not want any contact anymore until she apologizes to me. I want her to take the initiative for once, but it hurts like hell and I can barely resist the urge to pick up the phone. The idea that something might happen to her and the last thing I said to her was in an angry tone tears my mind apart. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anybody have a similar experience? How do I deal with this?&lt;/p&gt;

I live about 40 minutes from most of my family and my mom was the only person who visited me while I was in the hospital for 15 days and while my baby was in the NICU for 3+ months. 

And she wasn’t exactly the most empathetic and supportive person throughout my pregnancy and delivery. Examples: 1) she was upset that my friends came to visit me the hospital and 2) when she asked how she could help me while I was on bedrest, I told her I’d appreciate her helping me to do my laundry and straighten my house...her response was that she’s not my maid! 3) she called once I was discharged from the hospital and said she really wants to see her grandbaby but knew that I’d have to go with her and said never mind.

It’s been a pretty traumatic and exhausting journey to parenthood and I am struggling to come to terms with the lack of family support. Even more heartbreaking is thinking about my daughter not having a relationship with my family. 

When I try to create peace, my mother says that I need to apologize to my family for being so rigid about people needing to be vaccinated and not smoke around my baby (doctors orders).

He also encouraged me to post “something nice” on social media to make her feel better. She’s basically making herself out to be a victim.

TL:DR

Should I stay with a manipulative, somewhat narcissistic, financially unstable, lying mother just to save up for my dreams and deal with the emotional stress that it effects me with? Or do I move out and If I do move out do I still keep in contact with my family even though I've wanted to disconnect and lose communication with my family for basically since 8 years give or take now. knowing the emotional stress it'll cause them and the fact that my moms a hoarder and if I do move out my mom will have to move to a 1 bed apt due to our landlord a smaller apt will kill her emotionally. Keep in mind that moving out kind makes it harder to reach my dreams.

​

Backstory

Ever since I could remember I've had trouble with all of my family members, but this is mainly for my mom. Going through elementary school. I felt like I had a normal mom she'd do everything I thought she was basically who everyone else's mom is. I never really acted out in elementary school.

​

Middle school I was truthfully being a pain I'd lie, I'd steal money, I'd sneak out, and be out past my curfew.

​

in High school freshman year to sophomore year I had the same issue but also basically ran away but grew out of it junior year and senior year. I graduated back in 2014. I stopped acting out because I came to a realization that if I really want to leave or what have you I obviously just need to suck it up and deal with it.

Now I know I didn't put myself in the best light I just couldn't talk about my mom and not talk about me like I'm a star child.

​

Now I'm a very calm kid and I usually think before I act nothing really gets to me it's all about intention with me. I can 100% tell you that I've barley been in any fights outside of my house and never really yelled or argued with anyone outside of my house. I've never really been popular but I also wasn't classified as a nerd either I've been in the middle all this time. I saw that just to give you guys perspective. on the type of person I am I can guarantee you that if you talked to anyone in my circle and outside of my circle that have known me or my past jobs especially customers I work sales before that a grocery store and customers have given me tips, hugs, pizza, girl scout cookies, etc. because I was so nice and patient with them. The only person that stresses me out or people that get under my skin is my mother and my family.

​

Growing up with my mom

Now nothing really happened in Elementary school, my mom and father had separated because my father attacked her. My mom has raised me ever since. We are a Haitian family but English was my first language but ever since I could remember my mom has never really needed my help with signing papers reading stuff anything, she functioned just fine in my eyes. Like I mentioned before I thought she was just like any other mom, but I had a connection with her. She also had a boyfriend I want to say since 3rd grade I want to say and he was great.

​

Middle school same thing she didn't really need my help, I mean I'd always be called to help or bring stuff around the house again simple stuff. At the same time me and her would get into fights and she would always yell unnecessarily and a lot of the times she wouldn't make sense or the thing that she was arguing about held no value or I'd get blamed for things that were not my fault. For example I'd get yelled at because there are random scratches on her bed frame or that I broke stuff or moved things around or cut her flowers. mind you I never did that I had no motivation to do that lmao that's childish even though I was a kid. I'd somehow get yelled at and have an argument because I moved two inches to the left and not the right, I was too skinny I was this or that just very random arguments that made no complete sense to me. It was because of these random arguments and other things that happened around the house that made me act out.

​

High school I started noticing these manipulative behaviors she had. here's some examples, also I'll go off in a tangent here because I can't really remember everything in order. Around this time the boyfriend she had was still around. There was one time she told me to call him and fake call the ambulance. To tell the boyfriend that she fell and is unconscious and if he could bring her to the hospital. She was perfectly healthy though and literally lied on the floor when he came by while leaving the stove on.

Other instances she'd want me to take pictures of herself when she's in the hospital whenever she had a surgery or something simple and send it to everybody.

She'd lie a lot and would argue with you to keep her lie. She'd make you feel bad for her, we've also went to ""therapy"" where it would be her friends listening and giving advice for the both of us. When my mom tells a story she'd make it sound like she's an angel and make it sound like I was yelling and sounded like a demon. which usually isn't true and she'd be the one yelling. I've said ""why are you yelling?"" to my mom so many times since like 2010.

By 2014 towards the summer after my graduation. My mom and her boyfriend had broken up.

​

After the breakup

Ever since the break up. I've found out that my mom can not read, nor write. I've had to write and read and so almost everything for her. since then, I text, I email, I write cards, I fill out job applications, I fill out checks, I write down the addresses on mail, I have to drive her unknown locations that she doesn't know how to get to for work even though we have a gps in the car. OH yeah did I mention that her boyfriend took back the car that she bough for her so we were weeks without a car. I eventually got my own car as well. Being with her I knew that she would get into a car accident because well one I'm good at reading people especially since it's my mom I've been with her my whole life. A year later even though she's never been in a car accident before that I know of, she totals the car the accident wasn't bad she just lost control of the car and destroyed the underneath of her car and the passenger side of the car.

I have now been sharing the car that I've bought with my own money with her since the start of 2017 up until the end of 2018 I now pay for 2 cars because she can't pay for her own car. Why? Because she isn't financially responsible and can't hold a job because she always gets into fights at work even before the break up and because of her lack of being able to read and understand English.

Even when we shared my car I literally had to pay for the insurance which was $210 literally I was at college and could only work part time. So I paid $400 each month for my car payment. Now I work full time at sales trying to save money for school but also paying off my credit card debt.

the rent has been $749 for a while I've had to pay $100 a month last month because my mom didn't have the money I had to give her an extra $300. so in total I've given her $200 for her car and $300 for rent. that's $500 in total she has also been asking for money here and there. The rent is going up to $1000 next month. I was planning to give $400 because I have no other choice but if she asks for more money that'd just be ridiculous.

I can't even enjoy myself as a kid I've literally had to work since 16 because my mom isn't financially stable and literally sucks at saving money.

She even got married to this guy that her friends referred her too after the breakup back in 2017. she talked to me about it and I literally told her to wait because she hasn't even met the guy only online yet lied to everyone else saying that she's known him for a long time. since he moved in it's been non stop fights where my mom is usually the one acting ridiculous, he has since left literally after the wedding basically and has never come back. While my mom was left in debt for the wedding. pointless.

​

The Question

What do I do though? I wanted to save for school the place I want to goto I'd need $20,000 but due to these random expenses because of my mom and stuff my credit sucks and I'm only at $8,000. For the longest time I've wanted to move out and cut communication with my family because I literally don't want to deal with them but I am really not ready for the emotional reaction due to that action they will come after me. Do I just move out and continue communication?

Also does it make sense for me to do so only because now I won't be able to goto the school I wanted to goto anytime soon if I do because It's in another state and I wanted to move only to goto the school then move out when I came back. I mean at this point I'll be paying $400 for rent and $200 for her car I'll be paying $600 if I stay here with my mom but with her being unstable financially like this past month where I had to add in $200 more (which to be frank I knew was coming also because of her debt to income ratio I've literally been guessing everything that has happened with her that would affect me.) Yet if this does happen again Instead of paying $600 monthly I'll be paying $800 or more some months. Do I suck ip the touture and the way it affects me daily and stay with her or move out? keep in mind this will put her under emotional stress plus my mom is a hoarder and the way our apt works if the landlord knows I move out. my mom will have to move to a 1 bed apt. our apt currently is filled with a bunch of boxes.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to preface this by saying that I&amp;#39;m gonna see a therapist at some point but I wanted other peoples opinions. this is going to be pretty long so get out while you still can or just sit back for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​
TL:DR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I stay with a manipulative, somewhat narcissistic, financially unstable, lying mother just to save up for my dreams and deal with the emotional stress that it effects me with? Or do I move out and If I do move out do I still keep in contact with my family even though I&amp;#39;ve wanted to disconnect and lose communication with my family for basically since 8 years give or take now. knowing the emotional stress it&amp;#39;ll cause them and the fact that my moms a hoarder and if I do move out my mom will have to move to a 1 bed apt due to our landlord a smaller apt will kill her emotionally. Keep in mind that moving out kind makes it harder to reach my dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backstory&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since I could remember I&amp;#39;ve had trouble with all of my family members, but this is mainly for my mom. Going through elementary school. I felt like I had a normal mom she&amp;#39;d do everything I thought she was basically who everyone else&amp;#39;s mom is. I never really acted out in elementary school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Middle school I was truthfully being a pain I&amp;#39;d lie, I&amp;#39;d steal money, I&amp;#39;d sneak out, and be out past my curfew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in High school freshman year to sophomore year I had the same issue but also basically ran away but grew out of it junior year and senior year. I graduated back in 2014. I stopped acting out because I came to a realization that if I really want to leave or what have you I obviously just need to suck it up and deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know I didn&amp;#39;t put myself in the best light I just couldn&amp;#39;t talk about my mom and not talk about me like I&amp;#39;m a star child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m a very calm kid and I usually think before I act nothing really gets to me it&amp;#39;s all about intention with me. I can 100% tell you that I&amp;#39;ve barley been in any fights outside of my house and never really yelled or argued with anyone outside of my house. I&amp;#39;ve never really been popular but I also wasn&amp;#39;t classified as a nerd either I&amp;#39;ve been in the middle all this time. I saw that just to give you guys perspective. on the type of person I am I can guarantee you that if you talked to anyone in my circle and outside of my circle that have known me or my past jobs especially customers I work sales before that a grocery store and customers have given me tips, hugs, pizza, girl scout cookies, etc. because I was so nice and patient with them. The only person that stresses me out or people that get under my skin is my mother and my family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up with my mom&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now nothing really happened in Elementary school, my mom and father had separated because my father attacked her. My mom has raised me ever since. We are a Haitian family but English was my first language but ever since I could remember my mom has never really needed my help with signing papers reading stuff anything, she functioned just fine in my eyes. Like I mentioned before I thought she was just like any other mom, but I had a connection with her. She also had a boyfriend I want to say since 3rd grade I want to say and he was great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Middle school same thing she didn&amp;#39;t really need my help, I mean I&amp;#39;d always be called to help or bring stuff around the house again simple stuff. At the same time me and her would get into fights and she would always yell unnecessarily and a lot of the times she wouldn&amp;#39;t make sense or the thing that she was arguing about held no value or I&amp;#39;d get blamed for things that were not my fault. For example I&amp;#39;d get yelled at because there are random scratches on her bed frame or that I broke stuff or moved things around or cut her flowers. mind you I never did that I had no motivation to do that lmao that&amp;#39;s childish even though I was a kid. I&amp;#39;d somehow get yelled at and have an argument because I moved two inches to the left and not the right, I was too skinny I was this or that just very random arguments that made no complete sense to me. It was because of these random arguments and other things that happened around the house that made me act out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High school I started noticing these manipulative behaviors she had. here&amp;#39;s some examples, also I&amp;#39;ll go off in a tangent here because I can&amp;#39;t really remember everything in order. Around this time the boyfriend she had was still around. There was one time she told me to call him and fake call the ambulance. To tell the boyfriend that she fell and is unconscious and if he could bring her to the hospital. She was perfectly healthy though and literally lied on the floor when he came by while leaving the stove on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other instances she&amp;#39;d want me to take pictures of herself when she&amp;#39;s in the hospital whenever she had a surgery or something simple and send it to everybody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;d lie a lot and would argue with you to keep her lie. She&amp;#39;d make you feel bad for her, we&amp;#39;ve also went to &amp;quot;therapy&amp;quot; where it would be her friends listening and giving advice for the both of us. When my mom tells a story she&amp;#39;d make it sound like she&amp;#39;s an angel and make it sound like I was yelling and sounded like a demon. which usually isn&amp;#39;t true and she&amp;#39;d be the one yelling. I&amp;#39;ve said &amp;quot;why are you yelling?&amp;quot; to my mom so many times since like 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2014 towards the summer after my graduation. My mom and her boyfriend had broken up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the breakup&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since the break up. I&amp;#39;ve found out that my mom can not read, nor write. I&amp;#39;ve had to write and read and so almost everything for her. since then, I text, I email, I write cards, I fill out job applications, I fill out checks, I write down the addresses on mail, I have to drive her unknown locations that she doesn&amp;#39;t know how to get to for work even though we have a gps in the car. OH yeah did I mention that her boyfriend took back the car that she bough for her so we were weeks without a car. I eventually got my own car as well. Being with her I knew that she would get into a car accident because well one I&amp;#39;m good at reading people especially since it&amp;#39;s my mom I&amp;#39;ve been with her my whole life. A year later even though she&amp;#39;s never been in a car accident before that I know of, she totals the car the accident wasn&amp;#39;t bad she just lost control of the car and destroyed the underneath of her car and the passenger side of the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have now been sharing the car that I&amp;#39;ve bought with my own money with her since the start of 2017 up until the end of 2018 I now pay for 2 cars because she can&amp;#39;t pay for her own car. Why? Because she isn&amp;#39;t financially responsible and can&amp;#39;t hold a job because she always gets into fights at work even before the break up and because of her lack of being able to read and understand English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when we shared my car I literally had to pay for the insurance which was $210 literally I was at college and could only work part time. So I paid $400 each month for my car payment. Now I work full time at sales trying to save money for school but also paying off my credit card debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the rent has been $749 for a while I&amp;#39;ve had to pay $100 a month last month because my mom didn&amp;#39;t have the money I had to give her an extra $300. so in total I&amp;#39;ve given her $200 for her car and $300 for rent. that&amp;#39;s $500 in total she has also been asking for money here and there. The rent is going up to $1000 next month. I was planning to give $400 because I have no other choice but if she asks for more money that&amp;#39;d just be ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t even enjoy myself as a kid I&amp;#39;ve literally had to work since 16 because my mom isn&amp;#39;t financially stable and literally sucks at saving money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She even got married to this guy that her friends referred her too after the breakup back in 2017. she talked to me about it and I literally told her to wait because she hasn&amp;#39;t even met the guy only online yet lied to everyone else saying that she&amp;#39;s known him for a long time. since he moved in it&amp;#39;s been non stop fights where my mom is usually the one acting ridiculous, he has since left literally after the wedding basically and has never come back. While my mom was left in debt for the wedding. pointless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Question&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do I do though? I wanted to save for school the place I want to goto I&amp;#39;d need $20,000 but due to these random expenses because of my mom and stuff my credit sucks and I&amp;#39;m only at $8,000. For the longest time I&amp;#39;ve wanted to move out and cut communication with my family because I literally don&amp;#39;t want to deal with them but I am really not ready for the emotional reaction due to that action they will come after me. Do I just move out and continue communication?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also does it make sense for me to do so only because now I won&amp;#39;t be able to goto the school I wanted to goto anytime soon if I do because It&amp;#39;s in another state and I wanted to move only to goto the school then move out when I came back. I mean at this point I&amp;#39;ll be paying $400 for rent and $200 for her car I&amp;#39;ll be paying $600 if I stay here with my mom but with her being unstable financially like this past month where I had to add in $200 more (which to be frank I knew was coming also because of her debt to income ratio I&amp;#39;ve literally been guessing everything that has happened with her that would affect me.) Yet if this does happen again Instead of paying $600 monthly I&amp;#39;ll be paying $800 or more some months. Do I suck ip the touture and the way it affects me daily and stay with her or move out? keep in mind this will put her under emotional stress plus my mom is a hoarder and the way our apt works if the landlord knows I move out. my mom will have to move to a 1 bed apt. our apt currently is filled with a bunch of boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

Right now I feel so overwhelmed with emotions that I don’t know what to do with myself, I feel like I’m spiralling and this is probably going to be really long but I am just typing as I’m thinking. I just need to get this off my chest 

Context: 9 years ago my mum found out that my dad had been having an affair for 3 months with a woman that he knew from his childhood. He devastated our family and walked out on us and moved in with his new girlfriend, who I’ll call “maria”. He walked out with no remorse and no attempt to reconcile a relationship he had been in for over 20 years. Within a couple of months of their relationship he pushed myself and my 7 year old brother to be involved with Maria and her 4 year old child, he even insisted on us calling her our sister and told her to call him ‘dad’ from now on. All whilst never wanting to see us more than once a week- that turned into once every two weeks when we got a bit older. What’s more is that, in their 9 year relationship all Maria has wanted is to have a baby with by dad. But in amongst this they have ‘broken up’ (including my dad actually moving out) twice due to her forcing him out of her flat because she felt like it. Maria has also been diagnosed with a host of mental health issues that she has used in the past as a scapegoat to entrap my father, and it has worked every. Single. Time.
They’ve tried for a baby numerous times and she has miscarried twice due to drinking and taking drugs whilst pregnant. Eventually the doctors told her she couldn’t get pregnant so they stopped trying. But Fast forward to about a month ago Maria started to act out violently, emotionally and outright abusively. She would go to our local pub and tell everyone she was leaving my dad and that she didn’t like him anymore, and even spent an evening at my house with my mum (they’ve become somewhat friendly over time) saying that she was so sorry for breaking up our family because she didn’t want him anymore and tried to kiss her. My dad finding out about this naturally caused a huge riff in their relationship to the point that, up until three days ago my dad was organised to move out into another rented property and they were officially split up.

That is until today

When he took me to the beach and told me that Maria was pregnant with his baby and they were keeping it. Now i don’t know if this is just me being outright selfish and childish for my response but I couldn’t physically stop myself. I just cried. Cried and cried and cried for hours. Even now typing this I feel just a tight hideous pain in my chest. I feel horrible. I want to be happy for them, I really do. But something inside of me is seething with a fiery rage that I can’t stop feeling 
I wanted to scream in his face that they’re being selfish and inconsiderate of everyone around them. My step-sister is 13 now and she lives with my dad and Maria in a two bedroom flat. I said to him will you move? And he said they have no intention of moving and my SS will just have to share rooms !! I feel such a deep sadness for her. In early adolescence and teenage years sense of privacy and personal space is so important. How will she get that with a screaming fucking baby in her room?? Or in two years time when she sits her GCSEs will she get enough space and quietness to focus?? What about when she’s in her late teens and has a boyfriend? Will her 4 year old sibling still be so welcome then? 

And my brother. God. My heart hurts so much for my baby brother. He is currently in the middle of exams and I have told my dad not to tell him until they are over. My fathers emotional distancing and suppression of feelings towards me and my brother is something that I have grown numb to, I have hardened myself to being repeatedly let down time and time again. But my brother struggles to understand, and believes it to be a reflection on his own self worth and I can never forgive my father for that damaged he has caused. And I go to university in September, a chapter of my life I should be looking forward to but I am so scared to leave my brother. Its been hard enough on him to be an outsider looking in on a family not bonded by blood, but now? Well I just don’t know how he’ll take it

And I hate myself for looking at this situation so subjectively and how it will affect me but my dad wasn’t around to raise me from the age of ten and he’s made minimal effort to do so since he walked out on us all those years ago and I am just so hurt and angry. I can’t help but feel like he’s pushed a reset button, and the birth of this baby will destroy any shred of relationship I have with this man, my dad. Whether he likes it or not his full undivided attention will be on raising and investing into this new baby, new family. It’s barely a month grown and I already resent an unborn child. I resent the life its going to have. The dad that’ll raise them, a dad who was never bothered to raise me. 

It has taken me 9 years to compartmentalise the trauma and distrust and hurt that my father has pushed onto me from such a small age, I have tried my best to continue a loving relationship with him despite never truly being welcomed into his new family unit, especially by Maria. She has always resented us remaining as a part of his life, she has made it no secret in the past that she would like a clear split between his past relationship and the one he is currently in. And I can’t help but feel that this baby is that opportunity. Maybe I’m wrong but I feel it in my gut. I feel like I’m losing parent and nobody’s died, I feel betrayed, I feel forgotten, I feel unimportant. Why couldn’t I be enough for him? Why wasn’t my love enough for him?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;so this is my first ever post on reddit and normally I don’t do stuff like this but I have not stopped crying all day.

She has fallen on hard times over the past 12 years, but it was due to VERY poor decision-making on her part - like moving to the other side of the country without a job or a place to live and expecting her immediate family (whom she alienated) to support her. That obviously didn’t take well with her family and, at one point, I was homeless with my mom for a few months. When she attempted to move across the country again, I put my foot down after my friend let me stay with him - and predictably, she became homeless again.

Talking to her on the phone makes me anxious and irritable for days - and I need to be strong to ensure I make it to work to support myself. I myself am getting counseling. Despite my repeated advice to get counseling, she refuses.

It’s a fine balance between being charitable, while also being an adult. I love my mother dearly, but there’s not a whole lot I can do.

I can't swipe and don't want to swipe the big damn smile of my face! 

But before that a little background. I(M, 23) am the youngest of 3 siblings. Not only that, but also the youngest among my maternal and paternal cousins.
My eldest sister got married in 2012 and had a boy in 2017. He's a little more than 2 yo. I was pretty excited when she said they were expecting. Because you see I've never had someone younger in family to show my affection. 

My sister stayed at our place(yeah, I live with my parents. Cause this is India) for about 6 months after she had him. I was in last 3 months of my grad then. I used to skip last few classes and come home early to play with him. I absolutely love the little guy. 

Now cut back to today. I had to drive my grandma to doctor's(which is about 4km away from home) because she's having some problems with her health. On the same road lives my brother-in-law's sister, and my sister, brother-in-law and of course, my nephew were at her's for a dinner. Coincidentally as they were leaving I was also driving home. I saw their car and immediately called my sister. She said she saw me, and they had stopped 200 meters from where I was. I u-turned my car. So did my brother-in-law. Now we were on the opposite sides of the road once again. So I shouted stay there I'm coming. 

Now, my sister gets out of her car and is standing on the side with my nephew. The clever little guy recognises my car and is jumping in her arms. At the same time shouting ""MAMA! MAMA!"" (which literally means uncle in my mother tongue). I hear this and there's immediately a big grin on my face. I cross the road, meet him and he's still saying ""mama, mama."" with of course a smile on his face.

I'm 37 years old and I want to have a baby. I don't think it's going to be easy. 

I don't have a partner and I don't really want one. I had a very bad relationship in my past that made me just not want to be with anyone anymore (and it's not like anyone's knocking down my door either). This is my first issue. I have two therapists that both think having just a mom would be ok but they also think that my extended family would be important (I have a dad and stepmom, mom, and 2 sisters and brothers-in-law with 2 nieces).

Secondly, I'm diabetic and have PCOS, and being 37, I'm also old. I don't know if I will be able to conceive anymore if I manage to find a donor.

I started to think about adoption but tonight I've been reading some things from adoptees and how it's traumatic for children. I'm feeling bad now for even thinking about adoption.

I'm also not rich.

Am I just destined not to be a parent? Am I selfish for even thinking about this? I feel extremely selfish although I wouldn't think a traditional family was selfish for wanting kids.

It sucks that if I had ended up married and trying for a natural pregnancy, these issues would probably not come up at all. I'm thankful I live in a time when it'll be easier for me to have a child than it was in the past, but it just sucks to have so many obstacles and to have wound up in this situation kind of by chance.

I put driving off for a long time because I had bad driving anxiety. However, I am making plans this summer to learn how to do it. I'm taking online classes right now to get my Associate's degree, I've been submitting job applications to try to get my first job, and I also want to look into getting therapy to treat my Social Anxiety problem.

So I am trying to implement changes to my life now.

My brother told me, ""I was eager to get my license at 16. You show no motivation whatsoever."" I told him, ""I wasn't ready to drive at 16. Everyone is not ready to drive at 16. Many people learn as adults.""

I also didn't learn how to ride a bike until I was 20. I was VERY delayed in that because you have 5 year olds doing it. I taught myself how to do that. I told them this as well. I told them, ""I didn't learn how to ride a bike until I was 20. I am also delayed with driving, but I plan to change that soon. It's better late than never.""

However, it is embarrasing that little 16 year olds are driving and I'm not. I definitely don't want it to get to the point where my 13 and 16 year old cousins are driving before I am.

 I couldn't believe what I was hearing and questioned my daughter.

 I then confronted my dad face to face,he said he can't believe it and in no way has he ever touched her in that way. I said I didn't want my mum to hear this as it would upset her, he said maybe she should as this is unbelievable.So my mother was informed of this as well.

 Skip a day of questioning my daughter and the next step for me was to take her to the police station, which I did.
 In the meantime my father booked a polygraph test and passed with flying colours he was repeatedly asked 3 questions relating to the incidents for 2hrs during questioning. 

 Now my daughter is going to be interviewed by police and social workers and she is still insisting this is what has happened . 

 Now.. this is where I'm going to sound heartless ,I think my daughter is lying. She was getting into trouble at the time she came out with this because of her cheek towards my grandad . She says these moments she was touched only happens when she tries to grab the laptop from my grandad and it lasts 2-3 seconds and she runs away. 

 Tdlr , my family is wrecked, either my daughter or father is lying , my daughter is going to need councelling regardless of outcome.

So for a bit of context, we are both 18 and soon 19 F. I share a room with her, and I hope soon to get my own bedroom. Now, my twin had a bit of a handicap, she can't walk properly and never leaves the appartment so that means she is ALWAYS. HOME. Never a second for myself.
If I want to be alone, I have to go into my parents room, while she scoffs behind my back that doing that is childish.
I have a boyfriend(distance relationship) since almost one year now and everytime he calls (Discord)she complains and tells me that we are disgusting, and ""Why does he always bothers us with his calls"" and calls me disgusting when I sweet talk with him.
Since years, she asks for respect that she doesnt give me back. When I got my dental surgery and needed calm to rest, she put music full volume, singing her lungs off, and if I was to complain, I would get ""You don't live alone here!!"" And when she wants to rest, I have to stay silent and fuck off or she gets violent towards me. 
She stalks everything I do, gets in my business, judges everything I say/do, and she often follows me trough the appartment to see what am doing and ordering me to come back to the bedroom.
I have no freedom here because of her. I cant talk to my boyfriend without being told to shut up or insulted if I sweet talk with him.
She is always on her phone when we go to bed, volume, high lightning, and I can't complain or I get told to fuck off because again, ""You dont live alone here!"" 

And there are many times when she has been violent. Yesterday, I used my phone and she saw the lightning and got upset, telling me that ""you shouldn't use it that late, your wifi shouldnt even be on, stop answering to messages"" and I ignored her. She climbed in my bed, tried to take the phone off my hands, and when I wouldn't let it go she bit me hard on the back, and after a few seconds she said ""It's the cat!"" (Mind you the room was dark and the cat not even in my bed, he fled after she angrily grabbed me to stop me from moving) and there are so many other examples.

My mom know about all of this. She just says she is tired of ""the way we act towards each other"", and everyday I endure her listening to the same music full volume over and over, have to restrain myself from talking to my boyfriend and tell him what I want or do what I want, play what I want on my laptop because she doesnt want me to... and much much more.

This all happened yesterday and a still on going thing so I will keep you guys updated .

So before I begin , just a quick summary of my dysfunctional family , my parents had been together for 16 years , had four kids ( including me ) and had a lot of marital issues . I’ve had issues with both of my parents for the longest and honestly , it’s been really shitty.Around  Christmas my dad has been caught watching porn in our family computer and after a week he was “forgiven” even though the website he went into , were those sites where they stole credit card information and was later found out these websites took at least a thousand dollars from their bank account . 

So it all started yesterday morning , my class starts at 7:50 and because of this new policy at my sucky highschool , if I were to get 13 lateness , they’d mark it as an illegal cut (??) and this would result in suspension which obviously goes onto my record . It was 7:30 and I’m searching for my mothers car keys and it was no where to be found , I checked everywhere and when I went to the car to see if someone left it there , it was locked . I assumed they keys were locked inside ( there’s one set of keys and a spare ) and I decided to walk to school but by the time I looked at the time it was already past 7:50 and there was no one at the time to give me a ride and I had to miss school which honestly I couldn’t afford it but in no way was I going to take the suspension .  My mother understood and I was doing a lot of errands ( walking my youngest brother to school , picking him up , getting groceries, walking my dog , watch my sister ) and by the time my dad gets home , he starts screaming on why I didn’t go to school . I explained to him repeatedly that I would’ve gotten a suspension then he became quiet . My mother yelled at him asking why he took the spare key (  he takes it to work but has his own car ?) and my dad took out MY MOTHERS KEYS ! and said “ these are my keys” (wtf?!) and I got so mad and he was demanding to know where his spare key was and my mother left the house to his car to find his key to prove to him that he was in the wrong. 

so as this is occurring , I’m sitting on the couch just minding my own business and my dad proceeds to scream at me , asking why I didn’t go to school..again. I explain to him again but this results to more anger and aggression and he starts screaming for me to leave the house ( again,wtf?) and I said okay and was about to walk out until he demands for my phone . At this point he’s a foot away from , he already made a fist and you can literally see the rage in his eyes , now I have terrible anxiety and especially with him so I pushed my sisters play time crib in between us and he still is screaming for my phone , and I could feel my heart racing because he became so freaking angry and scary and I screamed back at him and said “Why?? So you can watch porn on my phone too!?” I guess my mom heard all the commotion because my youngest brother , who was witnessing all of this goes out to get her because he was in fear, and walked in the living room at the exact moment I said this . 

- 1 month ago - I was going through my google account search history to find a website for my school and found numerous of results of these porn  websites and they were just on a whole other level , it was just purely disgusting and not even normal ?? , he was searching up all this shit under my account that has important information but him being dumb , doesn’t understand. I checked the times and I was infuriated because these were the times where he  randomly disappear from the house FOR HOURS while I had to take care of his kids and be the parent he never could be , he’d make me feel like a slut every opportunity he could get ( the fact that I dyed my hair blonde , clothing choices , guy friends etc) and that’d bring my self esteem to the floor . I kept this from my mother cause well obviously there was no right moment “ hEy! Love this quality family time , it’s possible your husband is cheating on you and rather spend his time away from the family by watching porn ! “ 

Now fast forward to now , as soon as I said that , my dads expression was blank and went upstairs , my mother started to break down because this actually hurt her and i ended up exploding and told her that he was doing this every single day , every morning , night , afternoon ( unhealthy ?) and he came downstairs with his bag of clothes and started to blame everything on me . “ you separated us “ “you always wanted this “ “ how could you repay me like this” “goodluck with your life “ and some more bs that I couldn’t even comprehend cause it was just plain stupid and not even logical. So he left and hasn’t come back and it’s been two days and um yeah. He hasn’t called or anything and I’m writing this for someone else’s  perspective of this situation , was I wrong to tell my mom? Was this actually my fault ? ugh I have no idea , I’m sixteen , already stressed with school and exams , have no one really to turn to so here I am!

UPDATE : its been four days now and today my dad came back home and my mom had already threw all his stuff in a bag. they start arguing and screaming once more and my dad didn’t look at me or talk to me at all and he was insisting that he never looked at any porn and oh! The best part , he says “ I hate them so much , I never want seen them again “ ( he refers to me and my brother because of all this chaos , we’ve resented and lost all respect for him) my dad then goes upstairs to “cry” and my grandpa who lives close knew what was happening and tried to become the mediator of my family and went to our house , grabbed my parents into the bedroom so they could all talk. I was eavesdropping because I had finally put my sister to sleep and I needed to know what was being said because I knew the blame would be put on me anyways all I hear is my dad “crying “ and saying how his “friend” looked it up on his phone . He never once admit that it was his fault and that he was a victim ( ??) and he claimed that he needed to seek therapy ( but knowing him , he’d probably go once , claim he found god or relief then go back to his usual ways ) so my grandpa came back downstairs where me and my siblings were and told us that we needed to respect him and he needed to respect us . My grandpa implanted this idea that If we can tolerate him just for a short amount of time more , he could take us and go to Texas where we’d all live peacefully ( the idea seems nice ) anyways after he left me and my brother , sister and mom went out to the store to buy groceries and my youngest brother who’s only nine years old , stayed with my dad . 
We came back after an hour and my little brother pulls me back outside  to tell me that my dad said “ I hate grace “ ( my name .. he told his nine year old son that he hates his daughter ..?!) “ I’m going to leave and never come back” “you’re going to need me one day and I won’t be there “ “everything is a lie “ 
Now this got me pissed because why would he drag his own son like this? Why the fuck won’t he admit to his actions , why does he keep acting like a child , so I stormed back inside the house and I was furious , I yelled “ how could you said this to your son ?! What does he have to do with this? “ you really hate me and think I’m lying ?” . I guess he took everything I said and just twisted t by screaming at my mother “ why is she talking to me like this?! Who the fuck does she think she is? If she doesn’t respect me I’m leaving“ I immediately go upstairs but still close enough to hear what he was saying and all I could hear was how he should’ve hit me , how dare I to disrespect him , he was going to hurt me and he wouldn’t care if he went to jail , and that I was going to have do everything by myself without his help which is nothing new .He then proceeds to rant how he is also a victim and that he doesn’t give a shit about me , and my brother .  

I’m really just pissed and hurt about all this , I know I didn’t have the right to scream because it worsen the whole situation and the blame for my broken family is still on me. I never saw him as my dad and always saw  my uncle and my granddad as father figures , my dad really fucked me and my family up so many god damn times and honestly ? I don’t feel bad at all for saying and thinking of this but if he touches me , hits me , anything , I’ll be so relieved to call the police , I’ve endured too much verbal and physical abuse from this man and I can’t  handle it anymore , I don’t look at him the same way anymore and I feel like a shitty daughter but I can’t help to feel like this","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey! This all happened yesterday and a still on going thing so I will keep you guys updated .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So before I begin , just a quick summary of my dysfunctional family , my parents had been together for 16 years , had four kids ( including me ) and had a lot of marital issues . I’ve had issues with both of my parents for the longest and honestly , it’s been really shitty.Around  Christmas my dad has been caught watching porn in our family computer and after a week he was “forgiven” even though the website he went into , were those sites where they stole credit card information and was later found out these websites took at least a thousand dollars from their bank account . &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it all started yesterday morning , my class starts at 7:50 and because of this new policy at my sucky highschool , if I were to get 13 lateness , they’d mark it as an illegal cut (??) and this would result in suspension which obviously goes onto my record . It was 7:30 and I’m searching for my mothers car keys and it was no where to be found , I checked everywhere and when I went to the car to see if someone left it there , it was locked . I assumed they keys were locked inside ( there’s one set of keys and a spare ) and I decided to walk to school but by the time I looked at the time it was already past 7:50 and there was no one at the time to give me a ride and I had to miss school which honestly I couldn’t afford it but in no way was I going to take the suspension .  My mother understood and I was doing a lot of errands ( walking my youngest brother to school , picking him up , getting groceries, walking my dog , watch my sister ) and by the time my dad gets home , he starts screaming on why I didn’t go to school . I explained to him repeatedly that I would’ve gotten a suspension then he became quiet . My mother yelled at him asking why he took the spare key (  he takes it to work but has his own car ?) and my dad took out MY MOTHERS KEYS ! and said “ these are my keys” (wtf?!) and I got so mad and he was demanding to know where his spare key was and my mother left the house to his car to find his key to prove to him that he was in the wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so as this is occurring , I’m sitting on the couch just minding my own business and my dad proceeds to scream at me , asking why I didn’t go to school..again. I explain to him again but this results to more anger and aggression and he starts screaming for me to leave the house ( again,wtf?) and I said okay and was about to walk out until he demands for my phone . At this point he’s a foot away from , he already made a fist and you can literally see the rage in his eyes , now I have terrible anxiety and especially with him so I pushed my sisters play time crib in between us and he still is screaming for my phone , and I could feel my heart racing because he became so freaking angry and scary and I screamed back at him and said “Why?? So you can watch porn on my phone too!?” I guess my mom heard all the commotion because my youngest brother , who was witnessing all of this goes out to get her because he was in fear, and walked in the living room at the exact moment I said this . &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 month ago - I was going through my google account search history to find a website for my school and found numerous of results of these porn  websites and they were just on a whole other level , it was just purely disgusting and not even normal ?? , he was searching up all this shit under my account that has important information but him being dumb , doesn’t understand. I checked the times and I was infuriated because these were the times where he  randomly disappear from the house FOR HOURS while I had to take care of his kids and be the parent he never could be , he’d make me feel like a slut every opportunity he could get ( the fact that I dyed my hair blonde , clothing choices , guy friends etc) and that’d bring my self esteem to the floor . I kept this from my mother cause well obviously there was no right moment “ hEy! Love this quality family time , it’s possible your husband is cheating on you and rather spend his time away from the family by watching porn ! “ &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now fast forward to now , as soon as I said that , my dads expression was blank and went upstairs , my mother started to break down because this actually hurt her and i ended up exploding and told her that he was doing this every single day , every morning , night , afternoon ( unhealthy ?) and he came downstairs with his bag of clothes and started to blame everything on me . “ you separated us “ “you always wanted this “ “ how could you repay me like this” “goodluck with your life “ and some more bs that I couldn’t even comprehend cause it was just plain stupid and not even logical. So he left and hasn’t come back and it’s been two days and um yeah. He hasn’t called or anything and I’m writing this for someone else’s  perspective of this situation , was I wrong to tell my mom? Was this actually my fault ? ugh I have no idea , I’m sixteen , already stressed with school and exams , have no one really to turn to so here I am!&lt;/p&gt;

I do everything I can for my mom and my sisters. I come over and do yard work every week I come over and help them with any computer or car problems.

 However my family is under the assumption that I am the family punching bag. They feel the need to attack me personally.  They bring about failure I have or once or twice they brought up my anxiety issues as a personal attack. And I am still made out to be the bad guy.

 Now of course as a man I would never physically assault or get rough with my sisters however they get aggressive with me, and I'm not talking playfully aggressive I'm talking assault aggressive and nothing is done my mom doesn't seem to see it as an issue.

I have been dealing with a lot this past year. First my dad died last June, the day he died is coming up soon.  My mom she is the main issue I am having.  She is an alcoholic and she sees no reason to stop drinking.  She is mean as hell towards me and my family.  Anyway when I went to my dad's funeral she refused to let me in her house during the time I was there. The last day I was there she did let me in.  It was a nightmare seeing her house.  It was very bad, it smelled awful.  She also had 4 big hound dogs in the house.  It looks like something from hoarders.  I start to try to clean some and she just screamed at me.  I stopped and said I can help you. She didn't want my help.  I had to leave to soon. My kids were still in school and my husband couldn't miss anymore work.  On the road I got called by her and she would cuss me out that I left.  I had to turn my phone off she kept calling and cussing me.   Anyway I get home for a few months grieve for my dad.  I have problems with this.  I miss my dad.  She doesn't understand why.   She bad mouths him. Yes he wasn't perfect but who is.  Anyway she would call it text me saying she is starving or it's too hot or something.  I am 16 he drive away.  I have no way to help her. Sometimes she would text she is going to kill herself.  She has done this a lot over the years.  I would say I am calling the cops when she says it.  I would have her sister check on her for me.  Anyway things got bad around October.  There was a hurricane Micheal that wiped out the town.  My family drove down with supplies and we get cussed out that she doesn't want them.  I dropped them off at the church.  Anyway a couple of weeks later around Halloween she calls and she is drunk.  Screaming and cussing incoherently.  I hang up and get text that she has fallen down.  Then I said for her to call the ambulance or something to help her.  She said no she won't.   I told her to call different people that I knew was down there that might help. Well she didn't want to do that.  At this point I have been tired of her cussing me and talking to me bad. I thought it was just a bunch of bullshit.  Anyway I get more text and she said she got a man to get her up.  Then the next day I am getting text from her neighbor saying she fell down in the yard and been there over 24 hrs.  Then her sister called me saying she trying to convince her to get to go to the hospital.  I finally got her to go and I was on my way down there by plane and car. It's a 4 hr drive from the nearest major airport.  I get there and the dr says she dehydrated and has a lot of alcohol in her system. She has a very old fracture in her back.  He is also saying she has something wrong with her liver.  Anyway she sends me to feed her dogs and cat.  Her dogs wouldn't get near me and they were growling when I tried to get closer.  The cat was locked up in her room.  The house was a lot worse then I saw it after the funeral.   She was and is in complete denial of how bad it was.  She saw nothing wrong with the way she lived there.  It was filled with dog shit and piss everywhere you walked.  There were rat pills and roaches, I also saw a snake.  It was horrendous going in that house.  Because of how bad the house was, I decided to bring her home with me.  I convinced her to stay with me.  I am now not sure if we should have done this.  I had her sister help getting the dogs out of the house. I took her cat with us.  I just couldn't handle 4 big dogs that were going to attack me when I got close.  Anyway they were probably put down. I don't  know, her sister said they were adopted by the town vet.  Mom thinks they got put down.  I don't know.   It's been a rough 6 or 7 months living with her.  My kids are autistic and they are now confined to just being in there rooms.  She is staying in my livingroom because she can't get up the stairs. She just stays on the couch all day and night.  We all have to leave the livingroom by a certain time and it is usually when the kids eat dinner at 6 p.m.  We get cussed out if we stay any longer.  She throws her 2 cents when my kids have meltdowns and makes it worse.  She screams in my face, like gets less than an inch away and screams in my face, cusses me.  The other day something was on the news about a school bus being stopped and a car almost hitting a kid. She said that almost happened to me when I was 5 or 6 yrs old.  She then said I knew how to cross the road and that I should have known better.  I got upset and said how was I to see a car coming around a bus? Then she started screaming at me. I went upstairs to get away from her.  Then my 5 yr old get home and fix his lunch as usual.   She starts back screaming. I told her I can't handle this no more.  She starts crying that I did this to her.  She wanted me to hug her. I tried to.  She cried that I made her homeless and killed her dogs.  Then she was screaming at my boy and I told him to go upstairs.  He was scared and crying. She said I want him here. I  said no he can't take this. Then she started the suicide talk. I said you are going to do this with my kids here in their house?  I will call the cops or something.  Things are now starting to calm down but I can't deal with no more.  I can't eat, she puts me down about my weight.  I am starting to throw up everyday.  My husband and I constantly fight now. We haven't been together in months.  My kids have regressed in therapy's.

As soon as my grandpa got out the car, he looked at us, sighed, and walked over to the man in the red pickup truck. No asking if we were okay, or worrying. He was only concerned about how much money he’d lose.
2 weeks later, he got into another car accident. A hit and run in a casino parking lot. Quite a contradiction considering what he did 2 weeks back. Oh, and he had the gall to say that we caused him to get bad luck.

The 7 year old boy has ADHD and ODD and I think bi polar as well. He is on medication--Lamotrigine 100mg 2 tablets daily + Amphetamine-dextroamphetamin5 1 tablet by mouth morning and 1/2 tablet afternoon. I think his meds are messing him up. Their adopted parents are never home as they are always working or out of the country, and when they are home, they don't really acknowledge or help their kids. 

Recently; the boy has been acting out a lot, more than normal. He has been hitting his head on the walls for 30 minutes straight, having night tremors and having anxiety attacks/bursts of crying for up to 2.5 hours. I really have no idea what to do anymore or how to help. He really misses his mom and always has energy. He is getting bullied at school as well.

Into the girl, she is also being bullied at school but she's the ""good child"". She doesn't throw many fits, (maybe I've seen one) but anytime she asks her parents a question they dismiss it and send them to their room. I basically just spent 2 hours explaining sex, menstral cycle and body parts to her. 


They fight a TON. Which I get is normal, mainly because the parents choose favorites based on the day and who's being more helpful. That's how the attention is divided out.

Let me preface this with the fact that my parents have gone through a messy divorce in the last 8 months. It started with my dad having an affair with a coworker he's fallen in love with about 2 years and is now moved in together and whom I myself am very fond of. Over the years he's felt very distant to my mother in every sense both physical and mental and it's taken a harsh toll on his self esteem and his happiness. He felt a lesser man with each year. This decline had started 10 years ago when his older brother passed from a brain tumor that caused him violent seizures until his heart gave out. My mother had not been there for him much at all through one of the most trying times in his life and it was then he realized she couldn't be there for him when he needed her. They had been married 27 years until last year and are almost through with the divorce.

I'm now almost 21 years old myself and don't really remember a time they were ever affectionate toward each other so I perfectly understand why the divorce is necessary and I agree with it 100%. My dad has been very calm throughout all of this and attempted to make peace where he can with my mother. He lost a job that paid him over 300K a year, his house, and is now taking a traveling consultant job and is unable to see my little brother who is 16 as often as 50/50 would entail that they had agreed upon.

My mother, on the other hand, has no idea how to cope with any of this. She and I have always butted heads but I will agree she did raise me to be a very open minded and critically thinking person who has a lot of compassion. I'm one of the most forgiving people I know, even to people who have thoroughly fucked me over in the past and today. But I can not understand how my mother has been able to take out so much onto me, my brother, every person my dad has ever been close to and his family, and also my gf who is almost 19. My mom has never been supportive of our relationship even though I've never been happier in my life with someone. We now have joint finances, live in our own apartment that we pay for from our part time jobs while we are also full time college students. She and I are starting a business together on top of that. I would say with confidence that we are very mature and very able to handle our lives together, and my gf has shown me a new light to this world where I used to see only sadness and apathy. I have a mild form of depression, and for me it had always meant that I tend to become apathetic when I need to feel the most. It's a numbing sensation that had taken a toll on me over the years through some of my hardships such as losing my best friend 2 years ago to suicide. I can easily say that my girlfriend is the one and I'll always want to be with her.

My mother can't see any of that though. She only understands pure rage and has had this mindset for years even before the divorce. She has always been negative toward life. She's never helped me accomplish the many goals I've set out to do, and we frankly just don't see eye to eye. She has consistently harassed and, frankly, bullied my gf into hating her. And mind you my gf is not the hateful, scornful type one bit. She's said so much shit both to my face and behind my back to both my gf and myself and I don't know what to do. I currently am not letting her know where I even live because I don't want to see her in my sanctuary. I texted her on mother's day but that's the only communication we've had in weeks. In spite of all this I've still tried to visit her to try to get her to understand why we're hurting because of her but she'll take no accountability in any of it. She believes she's truly right in all of this to cause all this hardship on so many people she's close to. She's also been pretty shitty to my younger brother whos forced to stay over there because he's still a minor. I'm afraid she's alienating him as well as my self.

My question for Reddit is: what can I do?

I'm at a loss of action for my mother and I don't know how to get her to see the selfish antagonizing on everyone she's been doing for almost a year at this point. She's demoralizing herself and has lost a lot of people on this path of hatred. I've explicitly told her exactly how me and my gf feel over what's she doing and she won't apologize or even attempt to make amends. Shes in the mindset that my gf has driven a wedge between my mother and I, and is stuck there. She can't see that she has caused this and no one else. To her, it's always someone else's fault.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty long story so don&amp;#39;t feel bad skimming. &lt;/p&gt;

Over the years he&amp;#39;s felt very distant to my mother in every sense both physical and mental and it&amp;#39;s taken a harsh toll on his self esteem and his happiness. He felt a lesser man with each year. This decline had started 10 years ago when his older brother passed from a brain tumor that caused him violent seizures until his heart gave out. My mother had not been there for him much at all through one of the most trying times in his life and it was then he realized she couldn&amp;#39;t be there for him when he needed her. They had been married 27 years until last year and are almost through with the divorce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m now almost 21 years old myself and don&amp;#39;t really remember a time they were ever affectionate toward each other so I perfectly understand why the divorce is necessary and I agree with it 100%. My dad has been very calm throughout all of this and attempted to make peace where he can with my mother. He lost a job that paid him over 300K a year, his house, and is now taking a traveling consultant job and is unable to see my little brother who is 16 as often as 50/50 would entail that they had agreed upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother, on the other hand, has no idea how to cope with any of this. She and I have always butted heads but I will agree she did raise me to be a very open minded and critically thinking person who has a lot of compassion. I&amp;#39;m one of the most forgiving people I know, even to people who have thoroughly fucked me over in the past and today. But I can not understand how my mother has been able to take out so much onto me, my brother, every person my dad has ever been close to and his family, and also my gf who is almost 19. My mom has never been supportive of our relationship even though I&amp;#39;ve never been happier in my life with someone. We now have joint finances, live in our own apartment that we pay for from our part time jobs while we are also full time college students. She and I are starting a business together on top of that. I would say with confidence that we are very mature and very able to handle our lives together, and my gf has shown me a new light to this world where I used to see only sadness and apathy. I have a mild form of depression, and for me it had always meant that I tend to become apathetic when I need to feel the most. It&amp;#39;s a numbing sensation that had taken a toll on me over the years through some of my hardships such as losing my best friend 2 years ago to suicide. I can easily say that my girlfriend is the one and I&amp;#39;ll always want to be with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother can&amp;#39;t see any of that though. She only understands pure rage and has had this mindset for years even before the divorce. She has always been negative toward life. She&amp;#39;s never helped me accomplish the many goals I&amp;#39;ve set out to do, and we frankly just don&amp;#39;t see eye to eye. She has consistently harassed and, frankly, bullied my gf into hating her. And mind you my gf is not the hateful, scornful type one bit. She&amp;#39;s said so much shit both to my face and behind my back to both my gf and myself and I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I currently am not letting her know where I even live because I don&amp;#39;t want to see her in my sanctuary. I texted her on mother&amp;#39;s day but that&amp;#39;s the only communication we&amp;#39;ve had in weeks. In spite of all this I&amp;#39;ve still tried to visit her to try to get her to understand why we&amp;#39;re hurting because of her but she&amp;#39;ll take no accountability in any of it. She believes she&amp;#39;s truly right in all of this to cause all this hardship on so many people she&amp;#39;s close to. She&amp;#39;s also been pretty shitty to my younger brother whos forced to stay over there because he&amp;#39;s still a minor. I&amp;#39;m afraid she&amp;#39;s alienating him as well as my self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question for Reddit is: what can I do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m at a loss of action for my mother and I don&amp;#39;t know how to get her to see the selfish antagonizing on everyone she&amp;#39;s been doing for almost a year at this point. She&amp;#39;s demoralizing herself and has lost a lot of people on this path of hatred. I&amp;#39;ve explicitly told her exactly how me and my gf feel over what&amp;#39;s she doing and she won&amp;#39;t apologize or even attempt to make amends. Shes in the mindset that my gf has driven a wedge between my mother and I, and is stuck there. She can&amp;#39;t see that she has caused this and no one else. To her, it&amp;#39;s always someone else&amp;#39;s fault.&lt;/p&gt;

I have some thoughts I wish to shared and hope for some opinions.

A little over a year ago my father suddenly passed away, nothing out of the norm it happens to everyone at some point though I have not yet dealt with it.

Some context, In my younger days (32m this year) I never had an issue with my father he was a busy man and emotionally closed off but included me in a lot of the weekend activities he did ( shooting, farm work, etc) until I got to around 16 to 20, my parents split and he withdrew even further and sort solice in front of a computer.

He found a new gf flew her from the states to aus with her daughter, neither were very bright, lacked personal hygiene but were nice enough. Then he started doing all the family things with them and excluding me from those plans, had alienated my younger brother and later found out he was using my boarding money on them and was behind in his bills.

This blew up in various ways and we did not have contact for more than a decade. My mother always told me I should try and connect with him as I would regret it one day.

Then out of the blue one day long after I had moved away was engaged and doing well my father popped up on fb as a suggested friend. I spoke to my then fiance to see if she thought I should add him. Long story short I added him, he accepted and we gradually started talking in and off followed by seeing each other, etc and finally invited him to my wedding.

The following 2 years after my wedding and even my bucks weekend I started to really enjoy his company on an adult level. He even managed to hug me and tell me he loved me which he had never done before. Things were a lot better, not perfect but was on track to be a functional father sun relationship.

Then a couple of days before my wifes birthday I received a call from my mother (who found out through a family friend as she didn't speak to him and I didn't speak to any of his family) to tell that my father had passed away.

Fast forward the necessary evils of putting everything together for funerals, cleaning his house, solicitors and finally finding out how he died and the situations leading to him passing that could have been prevented by his side of the family that lived up the road from him, I am here now still working on his house (he hoarded everything! Lol)

What I have not yet done is dealt with it. I am similar to him and am very closed off. I don't talk to my wife about it unless I have had a few drinks but have explained to her I am not ready yet to deal with it properly and she understands.

However time keeps going by and I am still no closer. I understand he has gone, I have his ashes in a cabinet at home but I refuse to deal with it or mourn I guess. Yes I know this is not healthy I don't talk to anyone I know as I have always grown up believing a man deals with his own problems and the wife is a stress head but advice from strangers is easy as ultimately nobody here knows me.

My question is has anyone been through something similar and how did you handle it?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gday all,&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks,NoTrash6","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;-In august of 2018 my brother transferred from a local community college to an out of state university&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-In my brothers first semester he got a Cish GPA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-In the middle of my brothers second semester my dad saw a purchase on the credit card they share and saw him make a payment near a hookah shop&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Out of fear we drove to the out of state university confirmed with him and the bank that the purchase was actually a withdrawl from a ATM near the hookah shop&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-My brother on that day we visited him about the hookah bar purchase also went to a &amp;quot;party&amp;quot; the next day before we left we met him real quick and he seemed normal tho &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-My brothers 2nd semester just ended and he had a D GPA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-My brother also lacks contact with my family and also goes out alot on uber purchases,movies,eating out etc but doesn&amp;#39;t respond to our messages for some reason &lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

this is a bit of an odd question but i find that I have a lot of trouble communicating well with my parents. Its difficult to say without sounding arrogant and disrespectful, but sometimes their communication styles are a bit childish. My mother has always suffered from anxiety and my father is probably somewhere on the spectrum; not obviously so but he is kind of, hyper-focused a lot. a bit of an over thinker, and while hes not an aggressive person at all,  he tends to shout over small things. Perhaps the biggest thing is that I feel sometimes as though they're both hiding? I think they both have real problems with self confidence and self expression.

&amp;#x200B;

I love them both, but as I get older I'm finding it hard to have a good relationship with them because it isn't easy to have a real conversation with them. Some of that is my fault certainly, I've had my own problems with depression and anxiety and I certainly haven't always shown them my best side.

&amp;#x200B;

in some ways its such a subtle thing that its hard to describe and hard to bring up, but I've had conversations about this sort of thing with my sister so I don't think I'm being crazy.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like it would be a good thing if the two of them had a little more self awareness of these things, and at least made more of an effort to address them. I have raised the issue with them before and they basically dismissed it immediately. so I'm wondering what you all think? is there a polite way to bring it up that they won't dismiss immediately?  am I just being too critical?

So my best friend let's call him Mike. He and I have been best friends for almost twenty-five years and are closer then brothers. He was my best man at my wedding and the godfather of my daughter. He has been dating this girl lets call her Ami for the last six years. On Monday May 6 Mike finally proposed to Ami. Real beautiful moment. I was so proud of him.

So Mike and I have been talking non stop about all the details untill Mike got a call from His father we call paul. Now Mike hates his father Paul. he would do real cruel and abusive things to Mike when he was younger. And I have no love for him either as I'm biased and will defend Mike no matter what.

Now paul called because he heard of Mike's engagement form an aunt he told about it. Surprisingly pual was happy for his son and wanted to mend the fence between them. Because pual got help with his abusive nature and had even remarried after Mike had left. And Paul's wife we shall call Jill was pregnant. Paul wanted Mike to be part of the team for the baby and be in the baby's life. 

So Paul invited Mike and his fiance. To go out for dinner, Mike added as a stipulation that me and my wife go too just in case. So yesterday night Tuesday May 15 we go to have dinner at this restaurant that Paul chose. So it's me my wife Mine, Mike and Ami in my car and drive.
We get there and Paul greets us as he has already precured a table to commadate us and we are shortly seated. And then Jill walks over and sit down next to paul. And Ami jaw almost drops. It turns out Jill is Ami mother...  and then the startling realization hits us as Ami explains this. Ami doesn't keep up with her mom so and knew the basics that she got remarried. Ami at heart was a daddies girl so she didn't really care about her mom.

Dinner is about over Paul pledges to do right by Mike if Mike would give him a fresh start. 

Now the ride home was one of quiet then tears then screaming... Mike isn't deterred by there parents revaluation. He still wants to marry Ami. But now it's in this gray limbo point and nobody is sure how to proceed... Or the legality of it all.

Any advice... Or words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated. Or even just some legal advice would be great.

I will update this post as I get information","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok posting this for a friend as he and I were both in the story.&lt;/p&gt;

Thank you for reading my long story. I am from a traditional Chinese family. Our family kind of resembles tiger mom family but it is just worse.  My dad went out for work since I was 4 and I only got to see him once a year. My mom sacrificed her career to take care of me, she put all the hopes on me and has been harsh on me since I was little. I am being compared to others constantly , no matter what I do I am never good enough for her. When I was younger she physical abused me as punishment , then she controlled my money and commanded me to only study else she would cut my tuition.  Now I am 24, finally graduated from graduate school, all I wanted was her to love and approve me. But no she still says mean and nasty things to me

one example would be I graduated with a master but she isn't happy , because I started as a phd and I couldn't finish it, instead of understanding me for what I ve been through , she said ' you are just lazy as fuck , someone else worked 12 hours every day , why can't you ?' I started to have a non-Chinese bf , she kept saying ' oh those xx(insert my bf's race) are lazy , if you divorce in the future, don't blame me , I already told you'

I have been to counselling for half a year, I have very low self-esteem and use her words to define who I am. It's not working that well yet. Tonight I finally got the gut to tell her how it made me feel and how it hurt me , she literally said ' I think you are too weak and you have so many problems , why can't you improve yourself so others have nothing bad to say about you '?  things got escalated quickly I blocked her on everything. But it has happened before , I went back , it went toxic again , this pattern has lasted for 6 years, averagely once per month ish. 

I am here hoping to get an insight of what others do with their toxic parents, they are toxic to me but they also supported me financially before. fyi, I have been financially independent for a while. my dad doesn't want to get involved in this , he just says 'hey you should just ignore it' every time. My major issue is that I feel I owe my parents but bc of this long term abuse I am having mental issues and feel like I need to work so hard to earn love and I don't know who I am. I would really appreciate it if people share some insights with me, thank you so much !","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello:&lt;/p&gt;

We have had 2 baby showers and a wedding, each had a registry and neither had anything outlandish on them. 

Baby registry items: diapers, wipes, more diapers and wipes, a couple of breast pump supplies(tubes, flanges, gaskets) a glider(biggest item on the registry), pacifiers, and a few other day to day items. 

Our wedding was so close to our son’s baby registry that we just used that as our wedding registry. 

We had very few outfits for our second registry because we saved all the gender neutral items, and our friends who recently had daughters gave us about 100 outfits from NB to 12-18 month range. We had no nursery room items, we saved everything from our son, and we saved all the car seat peripherals. 

From the registry we got 1 pack of diapers, a mobile, dreft(for washing baby clothes), and a pack of wipes. 

We also got about a dozen outfits, supermarket brand diapers, toys and stuffed animals(something we saved from our son) other useless stuff. All of the useless stuff we got was listed as items we already have plenty of when the invite was sent out, and it was emphasized that we need diapers, listing off a specific one from Pampers. 

A few guests did it right, they either got a registry item and/or gave cash. 

For our wedding many people got cash, but a good amount of people got us useless stuff that we ended up throwing away. Our wedding registry was also our son’s baby registry. We didn’t need any housewares or typical wedding registry stuff, so we just sent out our baby registry in place of making a wedding registry. Our son’s baby shower was 2 months after our wedding so it didn’t make sense to have our guests buy us two rounds of gifts. 

On top of going rogue and not getting items from a registry, no one included tags and receipts. We cannot return these items or swap them out for what we actually need. We will end up donating them to our local family center so that they go to good use. 

Moral of the story, if there is a registry please shop off of that, or give cash. The family has made the registry because that is what they need for the baby/wedding. If you do go rogue, please also get a registry item. 

One person doubled up. They went rogue and made cloths and a blanket, got the mobile and included cash. They won the day.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So my family pretty much sucks at shopping off of a registry. &lt;/p&gt;

It's a very long story that I have made as short as possible, in chronological order, so please bare with me. 

23/f

- At the age of nine, I spent quite a lot of time at my grandparents house. Oneday in the shed my uncle (P) tried to touch my ""breasts"" which were pretty much nothing. He realized this upset me and apologized.
- At the age of 10, two of my sisters and I moved in with my grandfather (M) and grandmother (Z). My ""favourite"" uncle P still lived with them so was always around. Shortly after moving there, P dropped me at my friend's (B) house and didn't like the look of her dad (N).
- I believe that P spoke to his Police Seargant mate who disclosed that N had a record for sex offences. I was grilled by multiple adults but maintained that N had never done anything inappropriate to me. Despite this, I was dragged into the Police Station on a Sunday afternoon and subjected to a formal interview, without a parent or guardian present. 
- I maintained that N had never done anything but did begin to cry at one stage during the interview as I was stressed out by the irony of the situation. 
- The teachers at my school were instructed that N and B were not to come near me. When N realized that something was up, he called my father (D).
- D advised N that P had disclosed that N had a record for sex offences. N advised that at the age of 19, he had consensual sex with a 15 year old. He did a year for this and it's permanently on his record. 
- Nothing further came of this however I was still not allowed to have anything to do with B or N. 
- I lived with M, Z and P for the next 3 years and maintained a very close relationship with  P. He would go out of his way to do things for me and would wrestle with me and take me places, buy me things, attended school awards etc
- At the age of 13, a week before Z succumbed to her battle with cancer, P approached me one night and propositioned me for sex. I was horrified and we didn't speak for the week after this until her death.
- A week later when Z passed, I packed a small bag quickly and returned home to my parents farm with D. Both M and D were both visibly confused by this. 
- The day after Z's funeral, I got off the school bus to find my belongings in a pile on the lawn. He had thrown it all in his ute and pushed it out on the lawn and driven off. 
- I had a volatile relationship with my mother (S) and just before my 15th birthday, we had another fight and I moved back to M. 
- I spoke only to M however for my birthday P left a cake, fifty bucks and a card. I took this as a peace offering however things were very awkward and forced between us. 
- Around this time I began to date my first boyfriend C. 
- Gradually P began to pick me up from my fast food job more regularly instead of M. He would always play this disgusting Bryan Adams love song as soon as I got in the car. One day he told me that his second car (hiyundi getz) was now mine. I accepted but knew I wasn't actually accepting that ever
- I stayed at my sisters (G) house in town over the May long weekend. She offered to drop me home the next day so that M didn't have to drive in to town. I called M and he agreed. 
- Both P and G's partner (W) were there to pick me up when I finished my shift and P demanded that I come home. As soon as we collected my bags and lefts G's house, he started screaming at me about me being a whore for sleeping with that boy etc. He raised his hand to hit me at one stage but lowered it when I started yelling. 
- He had gone through my room and read my diary, hacked my laptop and been through my wardrobes and drawers. He saw the pills (that D and S had both agreed to put me on when I was living with them due to cramps) and lost his shit saying that I was sleeping with C. 
- He made me pack my stuff then dropped me off at my parents. He got out of the car without saying anything and walked up to D in the shed
- A couple of weeks later P called D raging that I was telling people that he had Gonorrhea. As a 15 Yo virgin I didn't know what this was, but in rage I screamed out to D, S and my sister (R) that P tried to fuck me when I was 13.
- D suggested we go an confront P with these allegations but I sent him alone. The next day D played it off to me as though P was joking and I had misunderstood. I didn't talk to D for a bit but it was pretty much swept under the rug by D
- D made it really difficult for me to see C after all of this, despite discussing the need to use protection when we had first started dating. I was only allowed to go into town for my fast food job and would be picked up straight after. 

I've come to the realization, eight years later, that I was groomed by a pedophile and my Dad covered it up. I called him for his birthday and put my theory to him that P had admitted the truth to him and he had concocted the joke analogy on his own... This fkr didn't deny it!! He also said that P had helped him. 

I'm currently investigating to get all of the details but I want to put my Dad in his place. He's a good, hard working and humble man, and always the pacifist, and it's just messed me up.

I’ll try and summarize and make it short my current situation. I’m a 23 year old female. Me and my father never seen to get along. I feel like he’s always against me, he has insulted me in the past, has torn me down, always shoots my ideas down, I feel like he never supports me fully, I feel like he never lets me have a voice of my own and when I try and defend myself, he takes it as an insult and direct attack against him, which only results in him getting more hurt/angry. He contradicts himself all the time by saying he “supports me and can approach him about anything”, yet when I do, he’ll lash out at me and tell me I don’t know what I’m doing and that I’m making all the wrong choices in life. My father has a very old school mentality and always explains things in a way that “this is the way it is and that’s THAT”, there’s no reasoning with him, no trying to change his opinion or perspective, it’s either his way or it’s wrong. 

Now being in my 20’s, all of the negative things he’s done to me in the past have really affected the way I see my father. I have no trust in him, no confidence in approaching him about things in life, and in turn this makes him feel left out when I share things with my mother and not him. 

My mom explains to me that my father is a reflection of how he was raised at home and unfortunately both of his parents have the same negative characteristics he now has, therefore he “doesn’t know anything else”. While I can understand that, I still don’t think his behavior is okay and I don’t accept it. It not only hurts me that he never apologizes for anything he’s ever done to me, but makes me feel like he doesn’t care to fix anything and would rather just brush it off than suck up his pride and own up to his mistakes. 

I do not feel like I am a forgiving person. I tend to hold onto grudges and this does not help me with my father’s mistakes. 

I can accept that his ways may never change, but I cannot be held accountable for the way he chooses to act towards me. It is very toxic to me his behavior and I choose to stay away from it. I do not live at home anymore either because of our relationship.

On Sunday May 12, 2019 i lost a dear friend. He was on his way to work on his motorcycle when he was struck by a vehicle and passed away. My brother has been friends with Adrian for over 8 years. In those 8 years, Adrian impacted so many lives surrounding me. From being a hard working young man to a humble dark humor friend. 

I first met Adrian when my brother brought him over to hangout and watch movies. I soon realized that this friend was different. He was always quiet but whenever he spoke everyone loved what he had to say. My brother  soon built a strong bond with 4 other friends (including Adrian) and they would all come over the house. I consider all 4 friends as friends too, but Adrian stands more because I knew him more after he also became my coworker. 

Me and my brother got our first job at a kitchen inside of a healthcare facility. After a year working at the facility, he vouched for Adrian to our supervisor and began working with us. I was in charge of training Adrian all the positions that I also worked. I grew a stronger bond knowing that he had a hard working mentally and he actually cared about the product he represented. The kitchen was a subgroup of friends and would occasionally hangout at the bowling alley which we called ""ravioli nights"" (Jersey shore reference). A few months later, I had an opportunity to move up in the company. I took that chance and applied and got hired in the admissions department. Little did I know that my sudden departure would result in Adrian having a bigger workload. He never complained to anyone about not having a day off in over a month. He stuck through the awful schedule and just recently my brother told me that Adrian was studying and starting to cook at the facility. 

I did not end up working long in the new position due to personal circumstances. Whatever new job I had, Adrian was there to support. 
There was about a year between my departure from the kitchen and last time I saw him. The last time I saw him was Saturday, May 11 2019. 

He was invited to my brother's gender reveal party and I was excited to see him when walked through the door. I vaguely remember, but the one thing that will stick in my head forever is that met my brother's old coworker that also in motorcycle accident. He begged you to always wear ALL your gear even if you were driving down the street. We talked about bike safety and it hurts because that was our last conversation. 

17 hours after I told you goodbye, my brother got a phone call that you had passed away 1 block from your house en route to work. We both were in denial and did not want to believe it. The next 24 hours were the longest hours I have ever encountered. All the memories I had with you rushed into my head but the last night I saw you will forever be burned into my brain.

Little did I know that my sudden departure would result in Adrian having a bigger workload. He never complained to anyone about not having a day off in over a month. He stuck through the awful schedule and just recently my brother told me that Adrian was studying and starting to cook at the facility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not end up working long in the new position due to personal circumstances. Whatever new job I had, Adrian was there to support. 
There was about a year between my departure from the kitchen and last time I saw him. The last time I saw him was Saturday, May 11 2019. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was invited to my brother&amp;#39;s gender reveal party and I was excited to see him when walked through the door. I vaguely remember, but the one thing that will stick in my head forever is that met my brother&amp;#39;s old coworker that also in motorcycle accident. He begged you to always wear ALL your gear even if you were driving down the street. We talked about bike safety and it hurts because that was our last conversation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;17 hours after I told you goodbye, my brother got a phone call that you had passed away 1 block from your house en route to work. We both were in denial and did not want to believe it. The next 24 hours were the longest hours I have ever encountered. All the memories I had with you rushed into my head but the last night I saw you will forever be burned into my brain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adrian Z. 
22 years old 
Gone too soon 🖤🖤🖤&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking your time to hear my story of a dear friend I lost too soon. 🙏🙏&lt;/p&gt;

Some backstory first:

My husband took a job overseas back in 2014. Before he took the job we had some financial issues and my parents helped us out a bit. Well my parents moved from Michigan to Louisiana to be by an aunt and uncle. 2015 rolls around, and my mom informs me that they had to file for bankruptcy. They were having financial problems and weren't sure if they were able to afford their apartment much longer. I end up sending her some money to help out. Well then I get the bright idea of maybe I should just move down there and rent a house and split the rent with them until they get on their feet. At least until they can get their credit scores normal again and some money saved.

Well fast forward to July of 2018. I have a sister who has been in all sorts of trouble. She managed to get herself into hardcore drugs, in and out of jail for stealing, and hung around some pretty shady people. She had been living in Florida with my brother at the time. My stepdad begs and pleads with me to ""let her come live with us"" that we can save her from herself. I tell him no it's not happening. She's 27 years old she can figure it out. I also don't have the tools or resources to help a recovering addict. So for months I receive snide remarks from him about how I am abandoning my family etc. And of course, I get sick of listening to that crap.  So I talk with my husband and we look into moving to Arizona (his new job he recently obtained is based out of there.)

We had plans to move in the fall, but recently our plans got expedited to July. Why? Because my stepdad told my sister that it was okay for her to show up on my doorstep. So about a week ago, he sneaks out the door before anyone is up, and goes and picks her up from the bus station. He then hides her in the bedroom. My mom has not approved of any of this. She has been pretty upset over the whole situation. She had planned on moving back to Michigan to take over my grandparents old house when we moved in the fall. I have a 3 bedroom 2 bathroom house I am renting. I do not have room for her as my third room is my work from home office. I am not accommodating her at all. She has been sleeping on my couch because I do not want any conflict with my stepdad (he has a nasty temper and he owns guns.) I don't trust him because of this situation. He's been extremely defensive of her etc. I have to hide prescriptions, money, car keys, wallets, etc. I hate feeling on edge in my own home.

Neither of my parents are on my lease. We signed a 1 year lease in 2015 and we weren't required to sign another, it just went to a month to month basis. So we can move pretty much at anytime we want as we aren't locked to anything. I am at a loss of what to do. I really want to throw them all out and tell them to find their own place now. My mom is super upset and she makes me feel extremely guilty. She's only really been the one who gave a rip about me growing up. Step dad never was emotionally available let alone physically (he would leave the house every chance he got.) There was a lot of favoritism revolving around my sister growing up and there still is. It's actually kinda sad to watch. I'd very much allow my mom to live with me in Arizona, but I don't want the other two around.

My mom is concerned because she thinks they won't be able to afford a place on their own at this time. Stepdad is about to have neck surgery end of this month and he will be out of work for a month. So I told them I would give them until beginning of July to figure it out. We have been looking at a place for mid July to rent in Arizona. I am super tempted to just give my mom money so she can move back Michigan when we move. I am so tired of the whole situation I just want it to go away.

What irritates me the most is they had 4 years to save up money. Rent currently split including utilities, internet, etc is $300 a month per person. So to me I figure there is absolutely no reason that they couldn't save anything. They claim they don't have enough money. I am just dumbfounded at this whole situation and I am not sure how to handle it. I don't like guilt trips and I am tired of putting up with other people's problems. Am I being mean for expediting my move? Or am I justified because they have had 4 years to get their affairs in order? Should I even bother giving them money? How do I know they aren't just trying to get more money out of me because they know i'm upset? I have all these things that run through my mind at once. The stress is obnoxious :/

I really feel like there's some shady stuff with my sister/stepdad thing. Just a gut feeling. Can't really explain it. Just want to get away.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a long one! Some backstory first:&lt;/p&gt;

I feel like I have no one to talk about this with openly. I appreciate any comments/advice.

I am about to go to 4 year university close to home. So my plan was to live at home, work, and save up during these 4 years. I live with my parents, two sisters, and most recently, grandpa.

He and grandma got divorced 20 years ago. Grandpa has cancer. He's been living with us for the past three years.

I'm honestly tired of it. I know he's old and doesn't mean to bother me but it's getting really hard.

I used to have my own room but when he moved in I was left with a little office space with no door, so all I have is one of those chinese sliding doors for SOME privacy. He has a room but he still sleeps in the living room and watches cnn all day with the volume up and it really bothers me that I can't study at home where I'm comfortable and have to drive to the library for it.

When i go to the kitchen he just stands there staring at me and i feel really uncomfortable sharing a space with him. I try to avoid him because he'll start talking and talking and talking. I like spending time in my the house, but with him there it's difficult.

I know dad wants grandpa to move with one of our other family members, but I honestly don't think he'll be moving out any time soon and it's difficult to slowly watch someone die.

Am I entitled and selfish? Is it time for me to take on some personal responsibility and find a higher paying job and roommates? I pick up my sisters from school, drive them to their tennis and gymnastics classes, and babysit when mom and dad go on dates, and I love doing this. But i don't want to live with grandpa in the house, so if i get more hours at work to be able to afford moving out I wont be able to help my parents put with my sisters.

I really don't know what to do or how to handle this situation properly. 

TLDR; Grandpa lives with us, now I don't have a room of my own. He got my room but he sleeps in the living room. Hate watching him slowly deteriorate. If i move out, I won't be able to help with little sister because I'd have to work more hours to afford rent. Don't know what to do.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;RANT.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m honestly tired of it. I know he&amp;#39;s old and doesn&amp;#39;t mean to bother me but it&amp;#39;s getting really hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to have my own room but when he moved in I was left with a little office space with no door, so all I have is one of those chinese sliding doors for SOME privacy. He has a room but he still sleeps in the living room and watches cnn all day with the volume up and it really bothers me that I can&amp;#39;t study at home where I&amp;#39;m comfortable and have to drive to the library for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When i go to the kitchen he just stands there staring at me and i feel really uncomfortable sharing a space with him. I try to avoid him because he&amp;#39;ll start talking and talking and talking. I like spending time in my the house, but with him there it&amp;#39;s difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know dad wants grandpa to move with one of our other family members, but I honestly don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;ll be moving out any time soon and it&amp;#39;s difficult to slowly watch someone die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I entitled and selfish? Is it time for me to take on some personal responsibility and find a higher paying job and roommates? I pick up my sisters from school, drive them to their tennis and gymnastics classes, and babysit when mom and dad go on dates, and I love doing this. But i don&amp;#39;t want to live with grandpa in the house, so if i get more hours at work to be able to afford moving out I wont be able to help my parents put with my sisters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really don&amp;#39;t know what to do or how to handle this situation properly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR; Grandpa lives with us, now I don&amp;#39;t have a room of my own. He got my room but he sleeps in the living room. Hate watching him slowly deteriorate. If i move out, I won&amp;#39;t be able to help with little sister because I&amp;#39;d have to work more hours to afford rent. Don&amp;#39;t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

This will be lengthy please forgive me. 

My mom passed away in October and I was living in the midwest while my parents lived in the southeast.  This was done on purpose due to my parents being toxic please keep in mind this was mainly my mother, but my father had his toxicity as well. 

When mom passed I immediately came to my dad to help him out with the funeral and because he has very little other family. I immediately did as I have always done and what was ingrained in me I took over. Cooking,  cleaning, planning the memorial service and making sure my father took his medication and ate properly. 

My father spent the holidays up in the midwest and was absolutely convinced he wanted to come and stay.  My husband and I both told him we would welcome him with open arms, but suggested he not make any huge changes right away. He immediately gave up his apartment despite our concern and the holidays were spent bouncing back and forth between the southeast and midwest. 

He can't drive the trip by himself, so I was dragged with him for every single trip. He begged and pleaded finally in the Spring for my husband and I to move to the southeast near him because he hated snow and refuses to give the midwest a real chance. 

We finally despite both of our hatred moved to the southeast.  My husband is basically estranged from his family and my father is the only immediate family I have.  

Since having moved here my father has been chasing women and absolutely treating me and my husband like garbage. Dad is 66 and has been chasing women literally from the ages of 25-71 and I have even been confronted by workers at the local big box store and asked if I can ""do something to control my father"". 

As his adult daughter I have tried everything including begging him to get therapy, trying to explain why he is acting inappropriately and it always ends the same way with him saying I don't want him happy and I'm standing in his way etc. 

I want to add my husband and I had to sell or leave behind almost everything we owned and at a great price emotionally and financially. My health is horrible and getting worse everyday as stress makes my chronic illnesses worse.  

My dad is very unsympathetic and doesn't understand why I'm worried about him and goes between well if you don't want to be here then leave I don't need you... and then saying he wants to die, forgetting or just not taking his meds. I have literally spent hours talking him down from suicide and I don't regret it a second.  

All of this being said I also feel like that I'm sinking back into the situation that forced me to be estranged from him and mom. 

I need therapy myself but I'm spending 24/7 making his schedule,  making sure he's taking his meds, testing his sugar and eating.  I go to the doctor with him or he won't go. 

In all this including my dads multiple sobbing suicidal weeks my husband has been a champ. Supporting me in trying to save my dad even though he believes I'm basically going to have a mental breakdown myself. He's giving up time, money,  almost everything we own and I have brought us both back to a location we hate, yet he knows I cannot afford to just abandon my dad.

Please tell me what I can do? Should I just walk away from dad? It will take months to save up and leave here. And my father has always been either all or nothing. I either leave and never speak to him again or I stay here and lose my sanity, my marriage and eventually my life. 

Please understand that my father is a disabled veteran and has mental illness.  PTSD being only one of several that has been diagnosed.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my first post on reddit and I&amp;#39;m new here in general so please forgive any mistakes I make.

This went on for almost two years,at the start i had a job and savings but by the end i had lost my job and had almost nothing in savings compared to what i started with.

I used some of my savings and took a trip to visit friends in the state i wanted to move to while i was there i decided that i wanted to stay and i did. I was so tired of her excuses. She seemed pretty happy for me at first but then she started calling me at random times crying and saying things that made me feel so guilty. Talking about how she couldnt believe i abandoned her and my family,saying that i hated her,ect.

She really wanted me home for the holidays so i came home and everything seemed fine between us,we had a good time and were best friends again. I packed all my stuff into a rented car and drove back to my friends. Then the calls started again,her life fell started to fall apart and that made me feel even worse.This went on for maybe 4 months or so and just recently stopped. I think she finally figured out that she couldn't make me come back and her life finally got back on track. I set up some boundaries and we talk once a week now. She sends me a 100$ once a month to help out with bills or food which im so thankful for.

So that brings us to yesterday,mothers day. I was pretty busy that day but i still called her and wished her a happy mothers day,talking to her for a while and checking in.

I was unsure why i needed to post all that when i just said it to her? So i went about my day and ended up forgetting about the posts. The following text message conservation happens at 9 pm.

Mom:hey...no message on facebook for me

Then she sent me six spam messages saying Hi.

Mom:pffft

Mom:others put messages on facebook for their mothers

More spam hellos.

Mom: You may forget this and i may forget to send you money tomorrow. No shit,i can forget too

Me:that is extremely childish.

Mom:i know,its funny.

I had put that 100$ in my budget for the month and i needed it to get food this week. So even though i wanted to tell her to forget the money i couldnt so i made a post on her wall.

Mom: im glad you didnt forget! Goodnight i love you!

 
Im just really unsure on how to deal with her behavior, i find what she did to be highly inappropriate and it makes me so mad that she used the little bit of support i needed from her against me.

I (F23) have an  extreme hatred towards my aunt. From when I was young, let's say 6, she abused me physically and mentally. My mum was a nurse so she always worked long night shifts, making sure I wasn't alone at home she made her sister move in with us so she could take care of me. Well that did not go as well as she had in mind. My aunt quickly started abusing me until a couple of years ago (the physical abuse stopped early on, but the mental abuse did not) . Pulling my hair very harshly, locking me up in dark rooms for a long period of time (wirhout food/drinks), putting very hot sausage in my mouth every time I did something against her will, threatening to call child support to take me away from my mum, calling me useless, telling me I would never make it in my life, almost forcing me in a marriage at the age of 17 because ""I will never reach anything in my life so it is better if I'd marry a guy 8 years older than me"". Like I said before this went on from when I was around 6 years old until I was 19. After she got married she disappeared from my daily life for like 3 years, but the damage was done already. I fell into depression, started cutting, considered suicide, I started to flinch anytime someone raised their hand and til this day cry whenever someone raises their voice or gets angry at me. To say the least I was mentally damaged. I managed to pull myself through, until at the age of 17 I was forced to live with her and her husband because my mum decided to woek in a neighbouring country to get more money. Note, my mum never knew about the abuse so she trusted her sister. 

While I lived at my aunt for the full 2 years she made me go through hell. Her husband openly treated me like shit, she treated me lile shit in support of her husband, she turned her kids against me, her lids even started insulting me, she kept on mentally manipulating me into thinking I was useless and I'd never get anywhere in life. My grades started dropping, I got depressed again. Heck she even managed ro turn my mom against me for a while. Anything I did, she would lash out at me. At times she disciplines her kids I'd flinch and had to go to another room because I couldn't handle the sight of her doing so. After two years, at the end of high school I finally broke down and called my mum. While crying I explained her everything that happened while my grandma begged her to get me out of her daughters house (mind you for 2 years I never had my own room, I had to sleep on the couch). 

So my mum came around and demanded of my aunt to find me a place to live. Which she did, at midnight, without looking well enough at the house. The house that she found? Yeah it was falling apart. The wooden stairs were rotten and too dangerous to walk on, the house flood everytime it rained, the heating wasn't working. Kitchen wasn't working. I had started my first year in university then and due to my situation it was a disaster. I lost a ton of weight due to the fact that I didn't eat well (kitchen stuff didn't work and didn't have much money to buy food). All of my classes were until 7pm and due to the fact that I had to sit on the train for an hour I only came home around 8pm or even 9pm. My mum called my aunt to see if she could give me food since I lived literally behind her and she said and I quote ""I don't care whether she is home at 9pm or even 1am, if she doesn't come around for food herself, I will not give any to her."" Then she dared to say ""wow you have gotten very thin since I last saw you"" when I had to go to her one day. After hearing about my situation, my mum dropped her job abroad and came back to live with me. She rented a better house and for 3 years now we are living greatly. However, my aunt has permanently damaged me. Just the sight of her name fuels me with anger. My mum understands it and gives me the right to be angry, however she says that I keep on repeating myself. Today I told my mum that no matter what, even if she'd apologise to me, I'd stay angry at her.

A few years back I had the chance to punch my aunt in the face, I regret not taking it. She still taunts me with it though. She told her kids about the fact that she used to abuse me, she told them she was sorry. But whenever she is around me she acts as if nothing ever happened, trying to make things right by giving me money and such. This too just angers me even more.

I get where my mum is coming from, that I keep on repeating myself which is tiring her, telling me to get over ir because it is something of the past. But her sister made me go through hell and I still feel the effects until today. Her presence in my life whether physical or online just will keep on making me angry until the day she is removed from my life.

My mum called my aunt to see if she could give me food since I lived literally behind her and she said and I quote &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t care whether she is home at 9pm or even 1am, if she doesn&amp;#39;t come around for food herself, I will not give any to her.&amp;quot; Then she dared to say &amp;quot;wow you have gotten very thin since I last saw you&amp;quot; when I had to go to her one day. After hearing about my situation, my mum dropped her job abroad and came back to live with me. She rented a better house and for 3 years now we are living greatly. However, my aunt has permanently damaged me. Just the sight of her name fuels me with anger. My mum understands it and gives me the right to be angry, however she says that I keep on repeating myself. Today I told my mum that no matter what, even if she&amp;#39;d apologise to me, I&amp;#39;d stay angry at her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years back I had the chance to punch my aunt in the face, I regret not taking it. She still taunts me with it though. She told her kids about the fact that she used to abuse me, she told them she was sorry. But whenever she is around me she acts as if nothing ever happened, trying to make things right by giving me money and such. This too just angers me even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get where my mum is coming from, that I keep on repeating myself which is tiring her, telling me to get over ir because it is something of the past. But her sister made me go through hell and I still feel the effects until today. Her presence in my life whether physical or online just will keep on making me angry until the day she is removed from my life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sorry that this is so lenghty.&lt;/p&gt;

Her elderly mother (94f) unfortunately doesn’t have long and has dementia. My mother visits her in the care home twice a day and even though there are carers to do it, she feeds her and washes her clothes.

My mother had to take early retirement last year due to stress when my brother (40m) and his wife (~40f) had a major fall out with her. This is mainly due to our not having been in touch with our neglectful father (57m) in over 15 years, but we decided to go and see him after his mother’s funeral. My sister in law believed some things my father said about the past that were the opposite of what my mother had always told us (that she had cheated and not him), so there was significant friction. She also didn’t like that when my parents split up 25 years ago, my mother had a breakdown and had to stop work, we lived in horrendous poverty, the bank took the house and she drank and overslept to cope. I had to secretly occasionally pay the milkman and local shop debt with my school lunch money. This was when I was 12, and although I can’t blame all of my problems on my childhood, I feel as though I missed out on having one and feel it held me back as an adult. I have a tendency to bury my head in the sand with my problems just as she did.

It came to a head a year ago when she says they were shouting at each other (the first time) and my mother shoved her. My mother swears blind she only put her hands up as she was screaming in her face and didn’t want her any closer. They admit to screaming at each other. My brother was there and is backing up his wife, though he generally does most things she says.

My mother dealt with the admin of my gran’s bills and bank account after she started to go blind, and some time down the line, she noticed that more was being taken (100 here, 100 there). My grandmother told me this around three years ago. I was speaking with her cousin (the one who lives with her for part of the year and is here now) and she said she leaves a bank card in the country for my mother to use for her share of the bills, and extra money from that had been taken. She confronted her once and was told “We’ll you told me I could borrow 150 anyway” when she’d actually taken 400. Another time she confronted her, she ignored the text.

She was declared bankrupt four years ago because she was on a low wage and could no longer pay the debts as a result from when she’d had a breakdown. This lifted a significant weight off her shoulders. Three months ago (a year after she had to stop work after the incident with my sister in law), I knew she didn’t have any money coming in, so I pressured her into letting me send some. It took a lot of effort, because if my mother really doesn’t want to do something, she won’t. Over the past three months I’ve given her around 900, which I can barely afford.

I don’t think drugs are involved and she’s not very technically minded, so wouldn’t know how to erase her browser history and I haven’t seen any gambling sites.

I’m not speaking to my brother and his wife because when he was off work with a knee injury, they borrowed thousands from our gran and now that they’re both on a good wage, have not taken solid steps to give it back. My gran is racked with guilt about not having anything to leave behind, because it’s been given to them and my mother over the years (not that she had much herself to begin with).

My mother’s cousin and I don’t know how to approach her that it’s time to sort herself out. She says she’ll get herself sorted, but it never happens. It’s not fair that her cousin has to live in a dirty house, but she gets very, very upset if we try to do any cleaning or offer to help her with financial admin. I can empathise that she’s embarrassed and ashamed as I have clinical depression myself, and I know it can make us wallow in our own pain to the detriment of others. She’s been on the same antidepressants for two decades and won’t get round to seeing the doctor to change to another one, won’t see a councillor or anything else of that nature.

I live in a neighbouring country and have to visit every so often when she’s at her lowest. I’m exhausted. We’re all exhausted. I just don’t know what to do anymore, but I can’t do nothing. I’d like to know how best to move forward so my mother can be helped to help herself, but not giving such tough love that she does something bad.

A little context before hand. My mom and stepdad don't get along. It has been like this for years. They're always fighting and when they're not they give each other the silent treatment. I couldn't care less if my stepdad would leave. In fact, I'm sure that my mom and myself would be much happier if he did. But she always let's him stick around. Likely for my little brother and sister. My dad left me and I think that she just wants to let them have their father since I didn't. Anyways, they're both awful with each other and whenever they fix it something new comes up always within the next month. I've had to live with it since my dad left at around the age of 4. I'm 16 now.

Yesterday was like any other. My mom was giving him the silent treatment. I was in my room and I all of a sudden heard her yelling at him. I get out of bed put on some pants and headed out there. My stepdad has a history of hitting my mom. Although it's only happened twice, the last time it happened I didn't do anything. I was around 12 years old and too small and weak to do something. I've now grown significantly and swore that if he hit her again then I'll be getting involved. Well luckily it didn't escalate to that and it resulted in my mom leaving in a very angry mood and my step dad leaving in an angry mood. My mom eventually came back and took us out to the movies.

Were watching Detective Pikachu when it was over I realized that I got 3 missed calls from my stepdad. He usually calls me when my mom won't pick up. So we go about our day and I go to sleep.

I wake up with another 3 missed calls from my stepdad. I ignored it because I figured that it was too late to call him back anyways. So I walk out and I see a ""Happy mother's day"" cake on the table that my stepdad bought. I go into my mom's room to tell wish her a happy mother's day and ask what she wanted for breakfast but the only person in there was my stepdad sleeping. I get out and look all around the house for my mom but couldn't find her. I was confused since her car was still outside. I tried to call her but she wouldn't pick up. I texted her if she wanted me to take the kids to church. She replied but simply said ""No."" I then texted her happy mother's day and that I loved her. She replied with ""Thanks. Me too."" I decided to just go about my day. I cleaned the house so she when she came back she'd come home to a clean house (which my stepdad has since dirtied up because he doesn't know how to wash dishes) and I made a pot of coffee for her if she happened to come back home soon. It has since been 8 hours since I've woken up, and I have no idea where she is. My sister came to me saying that she was worried and asked me to call her. I texted her telling her that my sister wished her happy mother's day and that she was worried about her. My mom then replied with ""tell her I'm fine. I just don't have the energy to out up with anymore hatefulness or drama(don't tell her the last part)"" 

I'm not sure what to do. I've been in my room with my sister just trying to distract myself but i can't. She's done this before but I'm always worried each time. I just wish I didn't have to deal with this.

Therefore I am not blood related to these people at all, so dont come for me for being related to these crazy nutsos.

Anyways, my step dads mother got divorced to his father. She was taking weed and LSD, and hes religious, so to him, that's a drug addiction. They also had many fights and it wasnt working out. Anyways, the mother (we'll call her Mary) had an affair with her 17 year old neighboor, we'll call Eryn. They later married. (I shouldve mentioned this was the early nineties)They had a daughter, we'll call her Hannah. This didnt work out and they also divorced. Eryn molested Mary s daughter, we'll call her Rachel. This happened aome time later, she was a teen, he was an adult. She got pregnant and they got married a bit later. I'm almost %100 sure Eryn Molested Hannah. 

Anyways, just recently, this caused relationship problems. I mean obviously. Hannah refuses to talk to Eryn.  I dont blame her. Eryn never served time in jail. He's a molester, why would she want anything to do with him? Well his wife Rachel keeps pestering Hannah to talk to him. But she won't. Rachel's eldest daughter, We'll call her Serena, is getting mad at Hannah for not sucking it up. Serena is 20. My mom is telliing her to stay out of this. Serena is getting pissed because in her own words "" I'm fucking 20 I can get involved if I want to"". Well earlier today, on MOTHERS DAY, she started a fight with my mother abd started calling her a bunch of names and the two were screaming. So I recorded the audio.  What pisses me off is that Serena is enabling and condoning her fathet being a molester. Also, her boyfriend is some guy in his 30s with a shit job, a wife who isn't technically divorced from. He also is verbally abusive. 

Not to mention my step dads family is the type who would say ""back in my day, we got spanked by 2x4s."" Please let me know if you agree that this family is toxic at least. 


Smh.

**I Came back to edit some things, in the hopes it clarifies it better.**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to preface this by stating that my mother is married to my step father. Therefore I am not blood related to these people at all, so dont come for me for being related to these crazy nutsos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, my step dads mother got divorced to his father. She was taking weed and LSD, and hes religious, so to him, that&amp;#39;s a drug addiction. They also had many fights and it wasnt working out. Anyways, the mother (we&amp;#39;ll call her Mary) had an affair with her 17 year old neighboor, we&amp;#39;ll call Eryn. They later married. (I shouldve mentioned this was the early nineties)They had a daughter, we&amp;#39;ll call her Hannah. This didnt work out and they also divorced. Eryn molested Mary s daughter, we&amp;#39;ll call her Rachel. This happened aome time later, she was a teen, he was an adult. She got pregnant and they got married a bit later. I&amp;#39;m almost %100 sure Eryn Molested Hannah. &lt;/p&gt;

English is not my first language so there might be some mistakes and I'm writing this on my phone so format might suck a bit.

Having that out of the way, let's get to the topic at hand.
The thing is, I'm 17 (m) and my parents who were married for some good 18 years or so are now getting divorced. They've been arguing and fighting for around 7 months now regarding the divorce. My dad is pretty happy with how things are going right now and has already found a new girlfriend, my mother, however, isn't taking all of it very well. She's sad and angry all the time and saying some irrational and nonsensical things. She initially did not want the divorce, but now I don't even know what she wants anymore. She's having a particularly hard time since we don't live in the same country as the rest of our family so she's pretty much alone. 

I'm living with her right now, firstly because I think it's important that she has somebody around but also because I'm worried that she might do something incredibly stupid which could end up with her getting hurt (or even worse). 

There are a few problems right now.
- I'm not sure what to do anymore since she does not seem to be getting any better.
- I feel like my patience is starting to run thin. I'm pretty much like a monk when it comes to patience but after 7 months I'm not sure how much longer I can endure hearing her daily complaining about my father and cursing him the whole time (I obviously still love him just as much as I love her. Duh).
- and lastly, today is the first time she mentioned suicide and said that she just doesn't do it because of me.

I hope I'm not posting this in the wrong sub.

Ever since I can remember my mum and brother have made my life hell, they're constantly having digs at me, being bitchy, sly and being very passive aggressive and also quite insulting to me.
Because of them and also an abusive relationship I suffer from severe depression and anxiety which I'm on medication for, and to be honest I dont want to know them anymore, I'm a full grown adult.

Whatever i do for them it's always wrong, both of them try to emotionally manipulate me and also use me for their own gain. I go to visit and I am met with a list of jobs, babysitting duty while they go out or do their own thing as well as insults and jibes constantly.

I lost my dad a while ago and he was the only one who stuck up for me and never did any of this, and honestly I miss him more than anything in the world.

Things got worse while my dad was sick, I helped my mum take care of him 24/7 for weeks at a time before I would go home to rest then return a week later, all while having 4 hours of extremely disturbed sleep. My mum and brother would take alot of their frustrations out on me and when I stood up for myself or my own family things would get worse (nothing physically just always verbal), at one point it got so bad I upped and left the following morning.

Now since my dad death I've visited twice in the last year, I barely message them and when I do I'm always met with a thumbs up emoji half way through a conversation or a simple 'oh ok', how do i respond to that? It usually occurs when i say something they dont like such as I'm working and cant come down, i instantly get guilt tripped by them.

The last time i went down the first thing my mum said was ""now you have that new promotion at work, when are you going to lose weight?"" Followed my digs and insulting jests my her and my brother - keeling in mind my brother is twice my size and my mum is not a small lady either. The moment I stepped foot into the house I had to help clean, I had to baby sit my niece while my brother played his xbox (he's older than me  and at 32 years old still lives with his mother with his daughter who he never looks after and leaves it to my mum or me when I'm around) I had to help with her homework, do arts and crafts with her, feed her and put her to bed all while having both mum and brother dig at me.

Not long after I'd won a raffle at my friends body shop store and got £130 worth of makeup and beauty products, I'd taken a picture of me with my make up on  because for the first time in a long time I felt great, I felt beautiful. A few days later my mum face timed me and while we chatted I sent her the picture to be met with ""very good, when are you loosing weight?"". That instantly made me regret everything I'd done.

On mothers day I sent my mum a card which arrived late due to the postal service but I couldn't get her a present, I explained it to her because I didn't have enough money but I wished her a happy mothers day and said I'd get the present to her as soon as I could. She told me to forget it then made a point of tagging me on FB about getting her hair done etc etc (the gift she wanted was money to get her hair done) she also tagged me in a post with my mothers day card to her saying ""better late then never"" all while praising my brother up and down the mountains on FB.

Whenever the thought of going down there or speaking to either one of them fills me with drad and anxiety, I hate it because I know what's to come.

Yesterday was my brothers birthday, I didn't send him a card nor wish him happy birthday, last night my mum sent me a message asking if I was alive, I read it and did not reply, this morning she sent ""still not alive?"" I haven't opened the message but I read the preview. I know it's about not wishing my brother happy birthday or sending him a card or present. To be all honest I dont want to, he never bothers for mine so why should I bother about his now?

I have no idea what to do with this situation as my mum and brother are extremely dramatic and over the top.

Anyone recommend anything for me to do? Please.

**Update**

My mum was messaging me about my brothers birthday, I got another message this morning asking if I was ""still alive"" to which I replied that I've been busy working. My mum then asks if I've forgotten my brothers birthday and again I replied ""no, I've been really busy at work"" which is true so I'm not lying.
The response I received was "" ok you missed it no probs"" so I did what she does to me and sent her a thumbs up emoji.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am so sorry for the long post but please read I need the help.&lt;/p&gt;

I found things out the most saddening way possible for a kid, i was about 9 or 10 maybe when my brother kept teasing and picking on me.

She told me that this is my family and that was my dad but i didn’t believe a word she had said. Fast forwarding to a few years later at about age 12, she broke the story down to me that my dad wasn’t then man she was married to which is my step dad but in fact she had told me that my biological dad was a narcotic addict. 

She told me that he tried to kidnap me and sell me in New York City. She told me every detail, and though it’s been a while, it still is hard to specify certain things just because it still hurts me these days. I always wondered what he looked like and what kind of man he really is, ya know, without the drug habit. 

Moving on, my mom and step dad split up. 
My mom had walked out of our lives, which lead to my dads drinking problem. Bud ice was his choice, everyday he would buy tons of it and drink until he couldn’t anymore. When he reached his limit he began getting aggressive and the very most hurtful part about it is, he would only target me, and i was the only one in our household that he wasn’t bloodily related to. He would tear my clothes, slap me, punch me, fight me super aggressively, take my phone away without any reasoning. Verbally abusing me as well, calling me out of my name. Telling me that my mother doesn’t love me, etc. 

All these are what made me feel so lonely and left out, so all the love I didn’t receive from my parents or any sort of family at that mad me look for love in men and other sorts, like drugs. 

I began trying all sorts of things to heal the hurt inside, nothing ever helped. I tried Xanax, perks, pills that i didn’t have any knowledge of, I’ve tried marijuana, those didn’t work so i tried a different method, which was drinking, only when i could hold my cup. 

I realized how dumb all of that was though, just hurting myself because every time i would drink, i just would get extremely sad. 

I did some research about the pills, 
With all the things the internet told me, i couldn’t dare to do the risk. I already have horrible mania and pessimistic trendies, not to mention, bi-polar depression, depression and anxiety. 

I still talk to my step dad though, he’s stopped his drinking for about 6 months now and my moms being more mother like. So I haven’t fully forgiven them but I’m coming to it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t really know where to begin. &lt;/p&gt;

He would tear my clothes, slap me, punch me, fight me super aggressively, take my phone away without any reasoning. Verbally abusing me as well, calling me out of my name. Telling me that my mother doesn’t love me, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these are what made me feel so lonely and left out, so all the love I didn’t receive from my parents or any sort of family at that mad me look for love in men and other sorts, like drugs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began trying all sorts of things to heal the hurt inside, nothing ever helped. I tried Xanax, perks, pills that i didn’t have any knowledge of, I’ve tried marijuana, those didn’t work so i tried a different method, which was drinking, only when i could hold my cup. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized how dumb all of that was though, just hurting myself because every time i would drink, i just would get extremely sad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did some research about the pills, 
With all the things the internet told me, i couldn’t dare to do the risk. I already have horrible mania and pessimistic trendies, not to mention, bi-polar depression, depression and anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still talk to my step dad though, he’s stopped his drinking for about 6 months now and my moms being more mother like. So I haven’t fully forgiven them but I’m coming to it.&lt;/p&gt;

I didn’t tell anyone until after a couple of months when I couldn’t take it anymore, seeing my mum very clueless and my dad acting like he wasn’t doing anything wrong. Told my older sister then eventually our mum. This turned out to be the start of the darkest period of my life.

My dad hasn’t really been a good husband to begin with, I realised as I aged, and only been a dad financially. As a kid, it was great, but being a grown up now, you need your dad to be there emotionally as well.

My mum wasn’t comfortable sharing this kind of problem to her friends, so because we hung out a lot, she would be telling all her problems to me. I was her best friend as she was mine.

Things started going downhill from the moment I discovered my dad’s infidelity. My sister got pregnant her last term in uni (and up to now still incapable of being a mum), my younger brother stopped attending school without us knowing, and my mum fell into depression. Me, I was in the middle of it all. I was “the golden child.” The one who excelled in school growing up, and in uni, got in one of the best universities. And I don’t know... I feel like most of the time, up to now, I’m the only one thinking about everyone. I would constantly message my dad about the things he needed to do, like buy mum something for Valentine’s Day or talk to us more and ask us what our likes/dislikes, simple things like our favourite colours, because he doesn’t know. I’d be talking sense into my mum a lot of times, scold my older sister and younger brother... I was dealing with it all.

Without realising it, I fell into depression myself and had an anxiety disorder. Couldn’t bear adding this to one of the things my mum was already worrying about, I sought help myself. That is, until my doctor encouraged me to tell my parents. I was never the same since then.

Eventually though, two years later, I found healing through traveling. Maybe because I can escape and be in a different environment with different people. I went away for more than a year and was genuinely happy throughout that time. But after a while I got homesick and decided to go home.

But going home, everything was still the same. My mum was still sharing with me the same problems. My sister and my brother, still the same. Dad, still the same.

I cried to dad one time about it and he told me it’s because I care too much and that I let everything affect me, and that it’s because mum always tells me stuff. He basically told me to just ignore all the problems and I said to him it’s what he does that’s why we still have the same problems.

Today, we had lunch together, it’s Mother’s Day. My dad would splurge on material things but with food, he’d take us to somewhere cheap or wouldn’t spend as much. But on a special day like this, it was upsetting. My mum hated this, told me about it again and kept quiet the whole meal but evident she was upset. My dad could tell she was but just ignored it. I hated it too - hated that we always, always have meals like this, hated that mum would have problems but wouldn’t tell dad directly but tell me, hated that dad is still very insensitive. I didn’t enjoy my food anymore because of them so I excused myself. When we got back in the car, things rolled back to how it was before the meal and they were okay again. And this is the cycle.

I’m tired of things being the same for years and years now. Everyone seems fine just living how they are. My parents seem to have grown used to always arguing and having little moments where they’re okay. My dad’s advice was to just ignore them all as I’m not really concerned - regarding their marriage or my sister and my brother’s problems, told me to just mind myself. But how can I when it does affect me greatly? True, it’s their life and I shouldn’t really care. I mean, when I was traveling, I was very fine because I didn’t hear about them much. So I guess the question is, am I the one who’s actually fucked up?

Come on be nice I’m your sister, and I said half sister and she got really upset and went to tell our mom lolll we’re both adults but she was hurt and said I’ve never treated you like my half sister and I’ve never called her my half sister before or anything but I said it as a joke and didn’t know she was going to be so hurt but the same way she thought having food cooked in peanut oil in MY car around me was a big deal I didn’t think my little comment would make her upset.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I have a bunch of cousins (like 56 first cousins), but one group of them drive me crazy.  The family of 5 consists of my cousins A, W, and J, and their parents, D and D.  J, the youngest, is graduating from ND next weekend, and because I must be some kind of masochist I just agreed to go visit them while they are there for the graduation (about a two hr drive from where I live now).  Because now I live super far from most of my family, I get excited to see some of them any time that I can, as I can't visit very often.   Now, I just also feel like it is important to note that D (their father) is my mom's brother, but PLOT TWIST: D (their mother) is my Dad's sister. This makes A, W and J my double cousins, we share both sets of grandparents...its weird, but true (they all grew up in a tiny TX town- no incest, just weirdness).  Thus: we come from the same gene pool.  So, instead of being around for half of the family gatherings in my life, they are basically at all of them.

&amp;#x200B;

I texted A to see if she would mind if my BF of 8 yrs, P, and I could crash on their floor (like, hotel floor) or something Sat. night.  Anyway, she and I were texting back and forth and I looked at some airbnbs and hotel options, and she texts back that her rich dad, D, had booked us a room at their hotel.  So I ask her: ""what do I owe him?"", and she texts back $800.  I knew she was just messing with me, but then she texts: he is booking two rooms since y'all aren't married...

&amp;#x200B;

Side note: A is 30 yo, and lives by herself and works in our home town as an engineer and makes lots of $ and does well for herself. But she has been with several different guys who all but officially lived with her at her house... W is 28 and also lives there and works as an engineer in town with his pregnant wife.  BUT THEY GO OUT TO LUNCH WITH THEIR PARENTS EVERY SINGLE DAY (and go to DINNER together too, most days).... isn't that weird? I mean, W is married, but goes to lunch with D&amp;D every single day.

&amp;#x200B;

So, this didn't bother me at first, I knew she was being dumb.  But last night, my mom went to eat with them and A told her that they were booking us two rooms because we weren't married.  She called me today to rant about this, saying that they are major hypocrites.  Like, they never ""officially"" lived with their SOs, so they have some kind of moral high ground over me.  Is it necessary to mention that my whole family is Catholic and love to pretend that they are perfect at this....whatever that means.

&amp;#x200B;

Random other story: There was a time when we had just moved (P and I) to a new city and P (he is hispanic in what was a pretty racist area) was having trouble finding work in the new town.  He finally found a job at a costume shop, and though not the best job in the world, he at least was making money and also was made manager after about a month of working there.  During this time, we went to my hometown for Christmas and ended up at D&amp;D's fancy Christmas party shindig.  While we were there, P and A started talking and I am not sure what the conversation was about, but A said in response to something about his past: ""Well now you work at a costume shop, don't you?"".  I remember this much: it was nasty and condescending, and just rude.  Exactly the kind of thing that should really just never be said to someone.

So, why do I do this to myself? I jumped at the opportunity to see them. Why? And a small part of me is excited.  We were good friends when we were all young, innocent kids growing up together. Now it all seems kind of messed up, like I keep wanting to be around them for some insane reason, and they keep disrespecting me to my own mom and just doing random things to ruffle up drama.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, not sure why I am posting about this, I am probably being overly emotional or affected by this, but I honestly just wanted to get it off my chest.

On to the story:  I'm 24, have one kid and another on the way. I did graduate college (not that it really matters) and my husband and I just bought a house after becoming debt free and saving for two years.  My mom came to visit briefly over this past weekend. We live pretty far from each other, so this was a nice treat for me because I miss her a lot. My husband revealed to me that my mom told him everything is going so well for me in life because ""I work so hard"" even though I had a concussion and that basically mentally retarded me or something. My concussion was my JUNIOR year of high school several years ago and yes, it was a very difficult time academically for me because I literally forgot everything I had been learning that year. I graduated high school with high enough grades and did great in college because school was always easy for me. The concussion has not affected me in any way, shape, or form since then. I do not have any side effects or lingering memory loss from it and definitely have not been mentally retarded from it. 

She went on to say she doesn't understand why my sister (21) is still living at home and not able to find a job or willing to go back to school to get a degree since she's SO much more intelligent and doesn't have to live with the side effects of having a concussion. I have no idea where this idea came from. My sister's not stupid but she's definitely not a genius  (not like I am either) but I would say I am more ""book smart"" than her and have a higher amount of common sense and self-control. My sister always struggled academically because of her lack of willingness to do anything at all. She missed school all the time and never wanted to do her work. That's not stupidity at all. However, we did end up attending the same college for a year (I graduated and she dropped out) and I constantly got emails and stopped in the hallway by  student tutors and professors (very small school) who would ask if I could please help my sister and explain very basic classes (college writing 101) to her so that she wouldn't be put on academic suspension and kicked out. My mother was contacted and notified about this. She was eventually put in a special class to help her and then she just quit. 

All this to say, that I am very upset and disappointed about how my mother views me. I'm not sure how to, or even if I should approach this topic with her. I already feel like I can't discuss my interests with my mom because she doesn't understand what I am talking about, but because my sister can connect with her and discuss their similar interests more easily it's obviously because my sister is smarter. I'm disappointed in my mother and in myself for feeling this way and especially upset that I am resorting to ""I graduated college and am financially stable so I'm smarter than my sister"" sort of thinking. I don't want to compare us in that way and I'd hate for it to ruin our relationship because I'm feeling bitter and shitty.

I've moved out multiple times but family members kick me out. I've told my mom my feelings and my suicidal thoughts, etc.

Most recently, her husband has been drinking more since he hasn't been working much. My brother got upset after being called a brat, so he called his dad a ""butthole."" That got his dad upset, and he locked himself in his room. My brother went in there to apologize, and instead of being an adult, my mom's husband chased him with a taser to get him to leave him alone. 
I was so shook I had no idea what to do. Of course my mom has been witness to this behavior for years. During that time, I threatened her with CPS. I went to therapy. I talked to my uncles about it. And yet nothing has been solved. 
I have no idea what to do, I've asked my mom to leave him multiple times. But, she's so lonely. She never had a good childhood and her dad would hit her mom.
Basically, this is normal behavior for her.
I feel like the only normal one in my family and I'm trying desperately and secretly to keep my brother from it all.

Background: I had an amazing childhood. I was very close with my parents. I didnt move out until I was 20, I loved who they were and how they treated me. I also did not notice or pay attention to how much they drank. It all seemed very normal.

Now, I am 26, engaged, with my own home  career, and life. Now, I notice how much of a problem their drinking is.

I live in the same city as them and I have greatly distanced myself. I consistently blame it on work, or just straight up avoid them. I cannot stand interacting with them when they are drunk. (My dad gets obnoxious, yells, swears, and often picks fights).

My sister is home for the summer from university and living with my parents. She just texted me saying mom and dad are wasted, having a huge fight, and she doesn't want to stay there anymore.

My mom is very passive aggressive and gets VERY defensive. My dad just gets straight up mean and he is even more stubborn. Often referring to the fact that it's his life and he can do whatever the eff he wants.

I'm not trying to make myself a victim. I just want to say my true feelings so I can move forward.

I grew up with a guy who thought it was more important to win the conversation rather than be an actual father. So I always had to walk on eggshells around him, and most of the time it was futile because he got angry at absolutely anything. He got angry at me one time literally because I didn't know the difference between Muppets and Sesame Street. But the most toxic thing is he got angry at me about getting jobs. The first non seasonal part time job I was offered was at at puppy hotel as a dog trainer/hotel staff. It was a hop and a skip from my parent's house and the pay was decent for my age and experience. And I could meet with cute puppies! But what does my father do? Complains about me getting paid to ""clean up dog shit"" and ""that job is below your skills"". It shocked me. He's the stereotypical hippie who always preaches that I should do a job that ""makes me happy"". But apparently not that job. I was young and spineless so I called the puppy hotel owner and apologized a lot, saying I couldn't take the job. I knew if I had taken it, I would hear non-stop nagging from my father. I regret doing that. I should have been firm and stuck with it. But I ended up accepting a job as an assistant teacher at a Montessori school instead. What did father do? Complain, of course. ""You are getting paid to clean up young kids' shit."" I only lasted one month at the school.

After living abroad for three years, I really thought things would be different when I came back home. My parents seemed close with each other. I had developed an interested in photography and was actively practicing to improve my skills. My father seemed genuinely pleased about it. But what happened when we got home? Same old. I started applying for photography jobs. Got over three interviews in the first two months. All of them were interested to hire me. I even drove an hour away from my parent's house to do an interview. So my father starts yelling at my mom about me wasting gas and having to pay tolls to drive an hour to a job, right in front of my husband. It was one of the most embarrassing moments in my life. I wanted to crawl up in a hole and die. That moment was the moment I realized that nothing's changed. Even past his sixties, my father still needs to win the conversation. He doesn't care about being a dad and he never did. 

I'm ruined now because of him. Even though I'm living with only my husband now, I can't seem to secure a full time job to support him and pay our bills. I just want my husband to be happy but I do things that piss him off like getting into emotional outbursts. I've had two panic attacks since we moved into our apartment, one that I had yesterday. I'm turning 25 years old soon and it feels like I failed at life. I have a useless A.A. degree in General Studies and looking for jobs makes me anxious and upset. I don't even want to study hard for anything now literally because my father got angry at me about it. Yeah, he got angry at me for STUDYING in my room for hours. WHEN I WAS ATTENDING COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

I never had a strong relationship with the man who helped give birth to me. I'm so angry that I don't even want to look or talk to him. My parents are living separately now. I don't know what he's doing these days and frankly I don't care.

He's told me how much he never wanted children and that he basically forced my mom to get two abortions before me.

Despite how much he sacrificed to raise me, he was never my dad. Just a guy living with us who complained and got angry about everything.








I want things to be different with my husband. I don't want to feel like we have to be careful about what we say to each other. I want us to live together happily and comfortably. And if we have kids, I want to be a loving mother to them. I want them to work hard, study hard, and have dreams they want to accomplish.

We've had ups and downs before, but we're steady. She's 27 and I'm 29, both have decent jobs, pretty shitty car, decent small-ish apartment, nice neighbourhood. 

We live in north Europe, Finland. My girlfriend doesn't speak finnish but we are both more or less fluent in english. Neither of us is religious. We plan to get married someday but it's not the first thing on the check list, just something that isn't a big deal for us.
We get by okay, but just barely. I'd say we are nowhere near the adults that I see people in the same age around here. We don't really drink alcohol or smoke cigs, I might take a beer or two after sauna but that's it. We do take a bit of weed every now and then, it's our little secret. Gotta remind you US readers, for most people weed around here is Satan's drug. You smoke weed today, you do heroin tomorrow. Common drug policy is from the 60's. 

Anyway. We're spending money on stupid and useless stuff, buying too much food we don't eat etc. I sometimes gamble more than I should and then money is tight, my gf buys makeup and clothes. Nothing major, it stays in control. Both handle our own finance, food and all those costs we share.

So yeah, came home from work tonight and I instantly saw that something's off with my girl. The good type of ""off"". Some questioning and I was told I'm gonna be a dad. HOLY SHIT?! I'll be honest, it wasn't a nice surprise. I didn't know how to take it, and I still don't. It's been 4 hours since I heard it, it's midnight and I'm having a billion thoughts in my head. My whole body feels weird and shaky. My girlfriend said that she'd understand if I don't want the child, she would leave and handle it alone. Obviously that's not an option, what kind of a man would that make me? We're in this hot, steamy pile of poop together.

So yeah. I'm going to be a dad in January. How on earth I'm going to pull this through? Any pro tips from recent dads or moms? Financial tips other than stop buying stupid shit and save money? Any help would be appreciated. Also Mother's Day is this sunday, any fun ideas how to announce this to my parents? They'll be cool about it I'm sure. 

Sorry if the whole text didn't make any sense or this is in a completely wrong board, I'm just a mess at the moment. Had to share some thoughts to a bunch of random people, just to get it out.

So I have an older brother who is 23, three years older than me. We are the only siblings in our family of 4 and we are somewhat close. 

The reason why I say ’somewhat’ is because I haven't really ever been able to understand him very well. You see he's kinda on the spectrum, not to the point that he needs someone to help him live but he finds it very hard to communicate with people, communicate his feelings, and he has always had trouble in school.  

He has never had a friend, and I'm not exaggerating. Not a single person. The most communication he's done is with his family and the people at his work, but he doesn't make any effort to hang out with anyone. We basically have to force him to go to most social events, again mostly just family gatherings. 

The only person I think he has ever confided in is me, but we still argue because that's just what siblings do. I try to go easy on him because I know he needs someone to talk to, because it seems like he doesn't feel like he can talk to our parents. Our mom has always done her best to gently encourage him to do things, but I think that just makes him feel guilty. My Dad, on the other hand, has been really hard on him for most of his life. Before my brother moved out he was always on his case about playing video games, being in his room, getting a job, doing his homework, everything. To a point yes it's tough love and he wants him to succeed in life but it's gotten to the point that my brother feels like he can't do anything right, and for most of his life he was just trying his best to get his approval but it was never enough. For a while, they were able to bound over hunting during my brothers teenage years but then my brother stopped all of a sudden for some reason. Now it seems like they struggle to find common ground. 

My brother had moved out of the house 2 years ago not too far from home but his social interactions now are basically none existent. He was in college for 1 year and figured it wasn't for him, so he went to work. He saved up quite a bit of money after 4 years of working, living a very minimalistic life but then he quit his job. Now he is just living on the money he has staying at home all day. 

I go to college about 3 1/2 hours away and unfortunately I'm not able to visit much. One time I went home though apparently she was talking to my brother and she was asking him what he was planning on doing if his money ran out...he just stared at her for a moment and said 'I don't know...' but from that answer, she knew what he was thinking.  For a more direct answer, we are worried that he is just living off his money until its gone and when it's gone he's going to kill himself...

This hasn't been the first time this was brought up either. He's admitted to contemplating the idea to me, I made him swear to never do that and it's not the answer. We've taken him to doctors, went to the therapist, and he has taken the medicine before and though I think he's started to take some again he doesn't seem to be motivated to help himself either. 

Me and my family are at a complete lost in how to help him, and we're scared that he's going to do something, but how do you help someone who doesn't want to be helped? Any comments or suggestions would be helpful but getting this all out is relieving enough so don't worry if you don't have the answer.

Basically, my Nan is 88 years old, been widowed for three years now, is relatively healthy for her age (although she'll insist she has everything wrong with her) and lives in a rural area that is quite remote in Hampshire. I live in London and usually go down every 4-6 weeks, I did go down more but have been with my girlfriend for a over a year so I cut back on the visits slightly due to costs and being more busy. My parents live in Yorkshire so can't exactly go down very often and my sister works and lives in Singapore. The only nearest relative is my uncle but his job ensures he works long hours and he has to go abroad as part of it fairly often.

Essentially we are worried about her vulnerability because if something goes wrong, she is quite far from the nearest hospital and we have suggested sheltered housing to her which she is putting off for as long as possible. This is understandable from her perspective as she likes living in the countryside, but the other downside to where she lives is the lack of opportunity to socialise with other people. Ever since my Granddad died, this has become more pronounced as he was very chatty and did practically all the talking. As a result, her social skills are now fairly low and unless you're talking about medicine and illnesses, conversations tend to be quite limited. We do speak to her frequently with my mum ringing her almost daily but even so, it's usually about what's supposedly wrong with her as she has a history of exaggerating or even making up illnesses. 

&amp;#x200B;

This usually happens when we are out and about doing things in our spare time or when we are about to take her out somewhere. Naturally this gets very frustrating for us and there is a ""cry wolf"" element to it. We think she has depression, but being 88, she doesn't see it as an actual thing and has a rather old fashioned view on the subject. To that end, I would be grateful for any advice from anyone having similar issues. I don't want her to spend her last years doing absolutely nothing when she is capable of doing more. At the moment she basically sits in her living room without the TV or Radio on, doesn't really read anything or see anyone.

We don’t see each other often but when we do, it’s usually a great time. 

We recently traveled home (South American country) together for a month. During this time we fought a lot. I tried to communicate my boundaries but she continued to disrespect them. An example, if she asks for something to be done, she requires it to be done immediately, regardless of what I am doing (finishing an email, working, relaxing). If I don’t do it she sulks and says something like, please do it really quick. Won’t take you long. This request is often for something minor like plugging something in for her. What is annoying is the fact that she is oblivious of what I am doing. It feels like she lacks empathy. Does she?? 

I am planning a new trip abroad to visit my uncle who is my mother’s brother and my cousins. Mom has not seen her brother in a few years and has not met her nieces and nephews. I invited her to come but made it clear to her that I will be taking three to four days to travel the countryside alone. I love traveling alone and the freedom of not having to compromise with anyone. When she and I traveled in our home country, our travels were not easy because of our dynamics. 

When I informed her of my need to take a few days to myself she became upset and decided that if she could not come with me on my solo mini journey, she would not come at all. Her excuse is that she doesn’t know the language (neither do I) and she doesn’t want to be left alone. Mind you, her brother and entire family would be there with her. She asked why I wanted to travel alone and I explained that on our previous trip, I had a hard time with alone time and the fact that she intruded on my time with friends often.

She has now changed my feedback to I told her that during our trip I didn’t have a good time at all. Which isn’t what I said. She is gaslighting me and is very good at it. 

Is she trying to manipulate the situation by saying that if I take her on my solo trip she will come along? How can I effectively manage this situation? Whenever I bring it up she tries to get out of the situation by saying she’s busy and hanging up the phone on me. Which she did this time.

I made some screw ups but that was just apart of life. My mom always had my back, told me straight up when she felt as if I wasn't doing something the right way or how to go about situations with looking at all of the sides of the picture. She was a fiesty 5ft2 woman. A crazy cool mom that I thought was completely embarrassing. But now as I am getting older I'm realizing I'm just like her. &amp; It kills me that I won't get to have that reconnecting bond. I have purchased the book Motherless Daughters about a year ago &amp; I haven't even been able to get passed the first dozen pages. The stories just breaks my heart with similarities with my mom. But now with losing my dad I just feel so lost. I just felt like finally I was just starting to feel somewhat okay. This was now my new normal. My sister (43) ((technically half, but we don't consider it that way)) was just going through open heart surgery &amp; so I had taken over of caring for my two nieces(9 &amp; 10) ((she's still in the hospital to this day)) &amp; maybe 2 weeks before that I had just got a second job, both of which my dad didn't know about. My dad was retired from post &amp; he was a simple man. Watch TV, smoked his cigs &amp; had his beer. He definitely could have been more active but he wasn't. He was so stubborn which I also have that trait of his. When he drinks hard alcohol you never know what side of him is going to come out. Honestly he was a alcoholic. I have been moved out from the family home for over a year, living with my boyfriend (26 M) of 5 years with my son (9), &amp; a roommate (28 f). I was pretty good at keeping contact with my dad making sure I either call or stop by maybe 3 or 4 times a month, going grocery shopping for him &amp; getting whatever else he may have wanted. I had a gut feeling one day that I should call him. But I didn't. I don't know why I didn't. &amp; Now I can't stop thinking about what I should have done. My mom's fear since I was little was that I was going to be the one that found him. In a way, I wish that could have been true. So I could have at least said goodbye. In a way that I felt meant something. One of his neighbors called for a welfare check on him because they noticed all of his mail in the mailbox piling up. My boyfriend says that God has a plan. That it was meant to happen this way. That I was spared from seeing what his 3 week decomposed body looked like. But all I can think about is how could I? How could I have gone that long without checking on him? How much of a piece of shit I am. I'm trying to be proactive in my healing. Trying to not take it as bad as I did with my mom. But.. I at least got to say goodbye to her. To tell her it was alright to go to the ultimate home. Her death was peaceful because I was able to be there in her final days &amp; hours. With him he was there one day &amp; gone the next. I loved both of my parents with my entire heart. They were my rocks. Now I feel like I have nothing &amp; no one even though I know that's not true. I have people who love me &amp; support me but I still feel like I have nothing. My foundation of life is just crumbling. I feel like every time I start to feel okay, God or the universe or whatever you want to call it says ""Haha fools on you"" &amp; just completely shits on me. This month was going to be the month where we could finally be caught up on bills &amp; all that. There's so much more that has gone on but in all that's nothing to all the pain &amp; anger that I'm dealing with now. My mom was cremated &amp; soon will be my father, but she was kept in his closet &amp; now I can't find her. Idk what he could have possibly done with her. They wanted to be mixed together in a urn but I don't know where he had put her now. The house was a Horder house. She was a horder &amp; he was a home body. I am lucky enough to have a little jar of her remains but it's not the same. I want &amp; need all of her. The rest that is. I can't let her go down with that house. Maybe this is just me trying to get all this shit off of my chest. &amp; If anyone actually reads this then thanks? I just have been so exhaustingly depressed &amp; scattered brained. My heart aches that I won't have my parents at my wedding or anything like that. They won't get to know their future grandkids. I don't want to be one of those people who hate others with parents. But honestly I probably will for a while. I don't want to be one of those people who say why me? But really, why me? What have I done to continue be being shit on. Each thing being worst after another. But now what could be worse than this? What else is the universe going to throw at me? I don't feel like I can take any more. &amp; Please don't comment &amp; say go to counseling. Half of me knows that I should probably go, the other half of me says mind over matter. You don't need it. I have a internal war within myself. I just feel so lost. But yet I know that I have to keep pushing forward. Again if any one reads this then I apologize for just it being so long &amp; probably rambling on. If you have your parents. Please tell them you love them. Even if you aren't in a good place with them. Because I don't want anyone to have regrets like I do.

My mom&amp;#39;s fear since I was little was that I was going to be the one that found him. In a way, I wish that could have been true. So I could have at least said goodbye. In a way that I felt meant something. One of his neighbors called for a welfare check on him because they noticed all of his mail in the mailbox piling up. My boyfriend says that God has a plan. That it was meant to happen this way. That I was spared from seeing what his 3 week decomposed body looked like. But all I can think about is how could I? How could I have gone that long without checking on him? How much of a piece of shit I am. I&amp;#39;m trying to be proactive in my healing. Trying to not take it as bad as I did with my mom. But.. I at least got to say goodbye to her. To tell her it was alright to go to the ultimate home. Her death was peaceful because I was able to be there in her final days &amp;amp; hours. With him he was there one day &amp;amp; gone the next. I loved both of my parents with my entire heart. They were my rocks. Now I feel like I have nothing &amp;amp; no one even though I know that&amp;#39;s not true. I have people who love me &amp;amp; support me but I still feel like I have nothing. My foundation of life is just crumbling. I feel like every time I start to feel okay, God or the universe or whatever you want to call it says &amp;quot;Haha fools on you&amp;quot; &amp;amp; just completely shits on me. This month was going to be the month where we could finally be caught up on bills &amp;amp; all that. There&amp;#39;s so much more that has gone on but in all that&amp;#39;s nothing to all the pain &amp;amp; anger that I&amp;#39;m dealing with now. My mom was cremated &amp;amp; soon will be my father, but she was kept in his closet &amp;amp; now I can&amp;#39;t find her. Idk what he could have possibly done with her. They wanted to be mixed together in a urn but I don&amp;#39;t know where he had put her now. The house was a Horder house. She was a horder &amp;amp; he was a home body. I am lucky enough to have a little jar of her remains but it&amp;#39;s not the same. I want &amp;amp; need all of her. The rest that is. I can&amp;#39;t let her go down with that house. Maybe this is just me trying to get all this shit off of my chest. &amp;amp; If anyone actually reads this then thanks? I just have been so exhaustingly depressed &amp;amp; scattered brained. My heart aches that I won&amp;#39;t have my parents at my wedding or anything like that. They won&amp;#39;t get to know their future grandkids. I don&amp;#39;t want to be one of those people who hate others with parents. But honestly I probably will for a while. I don&amp;#39;t want to be one of those people who say why me? But really, why me? What have I done to continue be being shit on. Each thing being worst after another. But now what could be worse than this? What else is the universe going to throw at me? I don&amp;#39;t feel like I can take any more. &amp;amp; Please don&amp;#39;t comment &amp;amp; say go to counseling. Half of me knows that I should probably go, the other half of me says mind over matter. You don&amp;#39;t need it. I have a internal war within myself. I just feel so lost. But yet I know that I have to keep pushing forward. Again if any one reads this then I apologize for just it being so long &amp;amp; probably rambling on. If you have your parents. Please tell them you love them. Even if you aren&amp;#39;t in a good place with them. Because I don&amp;#39;t want anyone to have regrets like I do. 
Tl;dr? Lost both of my parents, feeling lost &amp;amp; mentally exhausted from life situations. Would like some outside perspective. Or maybe someone had dealt with something similar?&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a long-time lurker on Reddit. Honestly this my first post about my own personal life on Reddit. First and foremost, I would like to say that my problems are minuscule compared to some other posts here on Reddit. Over the years my relationship with my family has diminished to almost nonexistent. I have to take some of the blame for this. My family originally lived in Florida and we moved when I was in 5th grade (This is honestly the biggest mistake my parents made and I think I am probably going to this against them for life). I remember prior to moving that there was nothing seriously wrong with my family. Right after moving to Georgia a series of unfortunate began. Some could be foreseen some could not.

Some more background information before moving to Georgia I did not spent that much time with my father. My father would often all day to support the family. My family moved to Georgia and my father did not have a job in Georgia. So, moving to Georgia was the first I got spend extended periods of time with him. I just remember my father being really strict and shouting a lot. In my first semester of 6th grade I brought home some bad grades. Needless to say, my parents were extremely displeased. Out relationship would continue to go down from there. The fact that my dad was home 24/7 made his presence overbearing. Sometime around 7th grade my dad broke his ankle (his ankle never did heal the surgeon messed it up) and had a heart attack shortly after that. In retrospect think this made him depressed. My dad went from being the bread winner of the house to disabled and unemployed. This was a very stressful point in my parents’ lives. My mother was the only one working. She was feeding two kids and her husband by herself. Some of their frustration was directed at me and my bother. That is the majority of what I remember of middle school.

Things got better when I got to high school. I was making better grades. I was playing soccer for select club and my high school team. My parents were a little less overbearing. My relationship with my father had not improved. My father was very supportive man but the way he would speak to would really irritate me. Constantly shouting or making comments on my failures but would never be there to help improve my skills. This was of no fault of my own when comes to sports or physical activities I am not a lazy person. Looking back, I think he used to health as an excuse to not practice with me(I know this because he would put a lot physical effort into doing things genuinely wanted to do despite his health conditions). I never really say did anything to him about this. When I initially got to college things got a whole worse between my parents and I. I was living at home while and commuting to college that was literally 44 miles away from my house. Again, I did several things that pissed off my parents. My parents found alcohol in my car, failed a class, and tried to live on my own (but couldn’t because my parents wouldn’t let me get the loan). My father’s health continued to deteriorate as the years went by. Unfortunately, my father died this past February and we never managed to development a true father and son bond.

At the start of moving to Georgia my parents started to develop some overbearing tendencies and has it really affected my relationship with them. I didn’t have many friends. Most weekends were spent playing computer games due to the fact my parents didn’t trust any of my friend’s parents. My parents never really did play with me that often. I don’t have a lot of warm happy memories with them. I remember my parents saying “No Tim you can’t do that,” the majority of the time. They never even took the chance opportunity to get to meet the parents and then determine if they were trustworthy or not. My parents were the non-negotiable type. When it came time to go to Prom, I didn’t have method of getting that didn’t involve my parent’s presence. So, I choose not to go. Not to mention that dating was off the table so for me so forget about finding a date. A definite lack social interaction happened to me during high school. I hated college because I literally lived fucking 50 miles away from the school and I couldn’t dorm due to parents. To top it all off my parents pretty much forced me to go to college. I honestly don’t care about anything that school has to offer. I would like to dropout but I’m in 30,000 dollar of student loan debt thanks to them ssssssoooo I have no choice but to finish. I was already an unmotivated student in high school what made them think that sending me to college was a good idea? I’m going to graduate with around a 2.2 GPA. There is no great high paying job waiting for me after college. After I graduate, I’m going to enlist in the air force as battlefield airman (don’t reply you should go officer I’m not here for your military advice). Being soldier is something I think I would honestly enjoy. I’ve always kept my self in shape and enjoyed extremely strenuous activities. I am planning on enlisting in one year. I am planning to use that year to get myself in better shape so I can pass the air force’s assignment and selection course. I understand parents aren’t perfect individuals and they make mistakes. Thing is my parents don’t even admit their mistakes. I want to have a better relationship with my mother but I can’t get past all the stupid shit and bad decisions that they have made in the past. After everything that has happened between my Mother and I, I just don’t have same level of trust and love in me has I did when was a child back in Florida. How do I get past this so my relationship with my mother doesn’t end the same way my relationship with my father did? I only have one year to make it happen.

I’ve spent money on therapy only to get the answer “while parents don’t have a favorite child, it’s not the same for kids at this age! You are just the favorite parent and prepare to eventually be the unfavorite.”

I cried! I cried because I love my son and he has such good character! I cried because, I’m broke and my son knows it, I cried because even in a relationship I’m a single mom, always will be, but after crying, I realized I’m not a complete fuck up! My son explained to me finally, he knows his dad doesn’t help me like he should, he knows how hard I work because his dad doesn’t help with money!

However recently, my son has been overly concerned with money! His school teacher called me to tell me, that my son brought in his change jar to school and asked to pay for the students that didn’t have money! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cried! I cried because I love my son and he has such good character! I cried because, I’m broke and my son knows it, I cried because even in a relationship I’m a single mom, always will be, but after crying, I realized I’m not a complete fuck up! My son explained to me finally, he knows his dad doesn’t help me like he should, he knows how hard I work because his dad doesn’t help with money! He also knows that other kids at school don’t have a good mom like me! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t need anything for mother’s day! I have an awesome kid!&lt;/p&gt;

I ain’t coming back to the house when I am self sustained. They don’t deserve it. Neither do I owe them this. I stayed at home as a loan taker. I would repay the same. Money for money. Food for food. Clothes for clothes. No emotional support. No moral. Do my best to contain them as they did me. Don’t care about the land I might inherit if I was a good boy. Too ignorant for that. Cannot toleration anyone for selfish purposes. That’s not me who can do that. I ain’t keeping my if any children from going to people. From taking a stance. From talking to whomever they might want to. They would get the confidence. I know what it feels like to hate the family you come home to. How empty it gets at times and still one doesn’t think of calling home. When one gets no urge to even complain or brag or share annny kind of feeling ever to the people whom you don’t care about anymore. 

Any suggestions?

So this is kind of a brief part of how messed up my life has been. I’ll start in 2016. I was 10 (male). My mom was having bad stomach pains so she went into the doctor to get it checked out. Turned out after multiple mri’s she was diagnosed with stage one colon cancer. Kind of went on with just treatments and new diet changes and that stuff for a few months. In the end of the school year of 2017, we moved about 45 minutes north of where we originally were. So at this point, I’m 11 y/o, new house, new school, and my mom has cancer. So I finished off the school year and then had an awesome summer, including my mom having surgery and being “cancer free”. Well I started 6th grade, and life was going pretty good. Then she went in to the doctor, and we found out that the cancer was back, and it was in lots of small legions, (too small to do surgery on) so she started chemo and we were also completely vegan at this point.  Well we get further into the 6th grade school year and in the beginning of March, my mom and step-dad announced that we were going to Mexico. Me and my 2 brothers were super excited. So fast forward and we’re in mexico. Had an awesome time, until we were about to get on the plane, and my mom starts crying. I tried to comfort her and asked what was wrong. She said she was just nervous about the new clinical trial she was going into. Took it in as all normal. So we get off the plane and get home at 11pm Sunday night, so they let us have Monday off. At about 10am Monday, they say we were going to have a family meeting in the living room, so I knew something was wrong but went in there. They announced that her immune system was not strong enough to do the clinical trial. (It was a pill that made your immune system attack the cancer). I asked “what are we going to do then? Go back to chemo?” My mom trying not to completely break down replied: “well, there are no options left” I was like “...wait you guys are just giving up?” And my mom said “it’s the best we can do.” She started acting super weird, but I can’t blame her, as she was conscious of the fact that she was dying in here own decision. I just hugged her, and tried not to cry. Fast forward a week and a half of her lying in a hospital bed unable to speak, we were having about ten people over, including my favorite cousin, so him and I went in my room to play some fortnite. My aunt, (my mom’s identical twin) came upstairs into my room crying. My first question was “is mom okay?” She shook her head no and gave me a hug. so she explained to me how my mom had passed peacefully, no gasping or anything like that. she then proceeded to explain that my mom just sat up for the first time in over a week, and didn't say anything, though she was obviously trying to, then waved her hands around her head, indicating that she was agrivated about something, then just fell back down. so anyways, my cousin and i go down into my basement, and hang out trying to act normal so that we didn't worry the little kids that were down there. now, both my aunts were explaining to my little brother what happened, and i heard him burst out in tears. so i went up the stairs to the landing that they were on, and i tried to give him a hug. when i did so, he pushed me away and started yelling at me. that was one of the saddest moments in my life, even with how much i dislike my siblings. anyways, i went to my dads house, which would be my new home. (my parents were divorced and he was living in the area that we had previously been in) so then, obviously my mom had life insurance, (about 300k) that would go to my new parents to support us, and eventually be our college funds, etc. my dick-face asshole-sociopath stepdad took it all, and later gave us about 24k. he then, about two months after my mom died, started dating another woman. now i am 13 living with my dad, and this family has plenty of problems itself, but school is still fucked as well. so much more i could tell anybody who reads this, (if you did make it to the end, thank you) so if you have any questions, comment below, and i will make edits answering those.

I (21f) moved back in with my mum (53f) in January after leaving my ex.

For a while, everything was fine. Everyone was happy to see me and said that me being there would be helpful because my mum was struggling with money and her depression.

Then things started to change. My mum's friends began acting cold towards me. My sister stopped talking to me except to have a go at me about what a lazy piece of shit I am and how disrespectful I am to mum by trashing the house all the time.

I know, this sounds bad. But hear me out. I have never ever so much as dreamed about trashing my mum's house. I'm barely there to trash her house. I work, I see my friends, I visit my nan and my dad. And when I am home, I do clean. I clean the living room, kitchen and bathroom daily before going to bed. I even look after her parrot despite it biting me at every opportunity.

Last week, my mum disappeared for four days. I didn't know where she was, but I know she was drinking because she came home with a hangover. The next day, I got a nasty phone call from my sister (HOW DARE YOU DESTROY MUM'S HOUSE LIKE THAT!). I had no idea what my sister was talking about. Turns out, my mum called my sister after I went to bed to tell her I completely trashed the house and she has to buy new furniture and plates and stuff. I asked her what else mum was telling my sister and the lies were getting more and more ridiculous. I asked her why mum wasn't talking to me about my apparent disrespectful behaviour and was just slagging me off to other people. My mum has been telling people she's afraid of upsetting me. This woman who would kick her kids out for the smallest thing (she once kicked me out for having a male friend, for example) is apparently afraid of upsetting me. I asked my sister why mum would be afraid of upsetting me and she said that mum's been telling people I have a tendency to become violent.

I've never been unnecessarily violent in my life. I've hit people, but only in self defence. I've never so much as raised my voice to my mum, there's never been any need for it. My mum has never had any reason to be afraid of me in any sense of the word. We confronted her after we calmed down and apologised to each other. She's now playing the victim and saying she's suicidal because her kids are all turning against her. 

My head is fried because now I don't know what lies I've been told by her. I'm questioning my entire life because I know she's been lying to me from a young age about stuff. I've found out about some of those lies recently, too. I don't know what to do next. I know I should cut her out of my life but I don't exactly have anywhere else to go. I know I can stay with my dad for a while, but even that would cause problems because of the lies my mum have spread about him","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, I&amp;#39;ll try to keep this short.

I am the youngest child out of two, and I am on the spectrum. My brother is 3 years older and is not. Now we were both raised properly, both taught the same things, taught about saving our money and such, y'know, the average things parents teach children about. Now, I had always thought that I would be the one who stayed at home past 30 due to my disability. My brother, who was PHD smarter, more outgoing,  would be the one who moved out and made a success of his life. 

Things.....did not turn out that way.

I moved out at 29 and got married at 31.  He moved out last year with a fiancé he had been giving money to while she lived in another country. This lady...is not very nice, but things have been getting worse and so has my brother.

Both my parents are pensioners. When he first went to university, he spent his entire student loan on a new game console, and dvds. We're talking over a hundred DVDs and a gameconsole that only came out in 2002 Xbox. My mam and dad had to bail him out, send money and care packages to him, even asking my gran for help to bail him out.  

When he finished Uni he then proceeded to bitch about how its the Governments fault he's in debt. As time progressed, he got worse. His political views got more extreme, to the point where, he would rant and rave at my mam and dad for reading a newspaper he disagreed with. My mam and dad would have to hide their newspapers to stop arguments. Mind you, this is their house he is living in. He tried to scare me into voting for some party, who I did not agree with, by saying the current government will make me worse off. When I pointed out I was actually better off under this government rather than the last, he tried to prove his point with articles 2 years out of date. 

My brother is a hypocrite. He complains about Microsoft but accepted money from them to do his PHD. He complains about the Government, but works for them on a contract basis. Oh and this isn't from his first stint at university. This is his second, that my mam and dad paid for. 

When I say that his fiancée is worse, I mean, worse. I believe she is the reason why he has changed so dramatically. The rift began when she asked that they get married close to where we live. 

When my parent's suggested that due to it being on the moors, and that having open flames in a marquee is not a good idea, plus the expense of toilets and car parking space, the fiancée called them vile racists. Spoiler alert, they're not. My wife is Asian. This upset my parents, but what did he do? Nothing. He said, and I quote. ""I don't like conflict, so I'm just going to let it all blow over."" 

Before this she had called me a  Nazi because I had a haircut, and has said, that remembering the end of WW2 is jingoism. 
My brother is in debt, very serious debt, and he's depressed over it, but now he earns more than me, my wife, and my mam and dad put together, and he still has no money. He got my parents to pay for his wedding, even though they weren't going to be invited until he realised, having family there would make it legitimate with immigration. To be fair, he tried getting a loan with a credit card company but he is deemed too much of a risk so he's been blackballed. He got them to pay for her NHS card and visa. He got them to pay for his flat deposit, money on his new car on finance. 

It hadn't even dawned on him that he could save money by eating the meals my mam made for him rather than spending money on takeaway and wine.  My mam made meals for him and he would come home with a pizza. When my mam did not make meals for him, he'd come in asking for food. He would cook meals for himself, enough portions for 6 and only eat one and leave the rest to be thrown out.  He's a vegetarian but my mam would have to sneak veg into his meals to get him to eat something other than quorn and potatos. 

And these are just a few of the instances where he has had money off them. I'm not including, car bills, holidays to see his fiancée and to move her from one end of the country to the other.  I, for your information, despite my own situation, with no help from my parents, have paid for my own car when it needed repaired. I am also in a better financial situation than him, despite being disabled. 

But just recently, they dropped a bombshell on the family which has killed all relationships between mam and dad and brother effectively, and what could have affected my own relationship and family. Without going into detail it came back to bite them on the ass, and he begged my mam and dad to fix his mistake. They did not. 

My mam and dad love him as a son, but feel like he's gone. Even saying, this last birthday was like the first birthday after someone has died and that she feels like she'll only have one grandchild. 

I feel like I am in the middle. On the one hand I am team mam and dad, but on the other, I have my brother and even though I do not like what he's done, I cannot turn my back on him, I feel, because he's depressed, isolated from all his friends, ect I don't want to be what pushes him over the edge. I also have to consider our children will be only two months apart in age, and he will be here longer than my mam and dad. But he doesn't talk. The most conversation I can get out of him is talking about Doctor Who and the latest episode. 

I don't know what to do.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going to keep this as short as possible and withhold some information as it is deemed sensitive. &lt;/p&gt;

Without going into detail it came back to bite them on the ass, and he begged my mam and dad to fix his mistake. They did not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mam and dad love him as a son, but feel like he&amp;#39;s gone. Even saying, this last birthday was like the first birthday after someone has died and that she feels like she&amp;#39;ll only have one grandchild. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I am in the middle. On the one hand I am team mam and dad, but on the other, I have my brother and even though I do not like what he&amp;#39;s done, I cannot turn my back on him, I feel, because he&amp;#39;s depressed, isolated from all his friends, ect I don&amp;#39;t want to be what pushes him over the edge. I also have to consider our children will be only two months apart in age, and he will be here longer than my mam and dad. But he doesn&amp;#39;t talk. The most conversation I can get out of him is talking about Doctor Who and the latest episode. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

I ,  a 24 years old female live with my dad's cousin in an apartment my dad got us , it's a small apartment but we managed to fit in 9 people including me , my sister and the house keeper .

Let me talk about the family that I live with , they're 6 members a single mom which is my dad's cousin and her 5 kids who are between the ages of 13 and 5 .
I'll be talking about my aunt ""dad's cousin"" let's call her -noah- for sake of the story , noah is 35 years old she was raised by her grandmother after both of her parents passed away at the age of 10 she later got married to an alcoholic cousin of hers who was 17 years her senior she later divorced him because he wasn't supporting the kids and he almost cut ties with them because of his other alcoholic doggie wife .


The reason I wanted to talk about Noah is because I'm always surprised by her actions towards her kids and I wanted to know if there are other people like her in the world because I've never seen anybody like that .

I grew up with a caring single mom who aways listened to me and my sister she was a bit strict but overall she was the best so in my head I'm thinking that's how all single moms are until I started living with Noah 3 years ago .


So Noah works at her friend's shop as a manager and she has the most flexible woking hours ever she can go to work whenever she wants any day she wants and if she went to the shop it's always from 4 PM to 11 PM so she's got so much free time on her hand a time to take care of her kids and house but no that's not the case at all , first of all she decided to get a housekeeper/nanny to take care of the kids people might think maybe it's hard for her to take care of them all day long and they need somebody to look after them when shes gone but that's not why she got a nanny the reason is because she wants to either party or sleep when she's not working .
Noah comes home at 3 in the morning after being out with friends a party or a wedding then she sleeps until its 4 PM then heads to work and so on you'll be asking your self by now when does she spend time her kids well she does not and that's the first thing I was surprised about after I started living with her. 

Noah sounds like a careless selfish woman by this point but she's actually not she's the most caring , loving ,  generous person on earth when it comes to everybody else but her her 5 kids I always wonder why can't she give all that love and generosity to the poor children .

Two years ago one of the children went into a coma and was hospitalized for 10 days and I startedI to think she'll finally come to her senses after experiencing almost a loss of a child but she did not,  I was the one at the hospital for those 10 days and the kid who was hospitalized even fell in love with me and said he'll Mary me because I cared for him so much lol . 

Noah never stops to surprise me as always she decided for some reason to spend almost 700$ every week on brand shoes, bags , treatment spas meanwhile her kids only wear 20$ shoes and each one of them have an old pair that you wouldn't even donate to a less fortunate person. 
The kids are raised on junk food the nanny does not give a sh*t about what they're eating she only cooks them whatever Noah decides to buy which is junk all the time , one kid has a hearing difficulty the other has a heart problem but she never took them to a doctor even though she knows her family has a history with heart disease and hearing difficulties .

I don't know when she'll ever come to her senses to appreciate the blessings God gave her in years her kids will grow up and I'm pretty sure they'll cut ties with her because that's the appropriate thing to do with such person.  

What do you think guys ? Do you think she'll ever change I like Noah so much and I only hope she cares for her kids .","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer : English is not my first language so bare with the grammar mistakes .&lt;/p&gt;

Here is the dilemma: 

My husband and I moved across the country about 6 years ago when we graduated college to start our careers. We currently have no children. Since we've moved my mother has been very supportive and has been interested in coming to see us about once a year (its a 30 hour drive so flying is the only realistic option). My parents are divorced and my father has made the visit exactly 1 time after we moved, and my adult sister has only visited twice in the last 6 years (both times paid for by my mother). My MIL and husbands siblings are also very open about visiting and we see them about once a year where we live as well. 

My husband and I normally fly home once a year for about a week to see our family around Christmas. Both of our immediate families are from the same home town, so it means we have a lot of people to see at once. We've tried coming home for longer since we have so much family in the area, but often got the impression we were over staying our welcome from my side of the family so we've shortened our trip duration in recent years. We also try to make an effort to see my husbands extended family who lives about an hour away, and make the effort to see my sister where she lives (an hour and a half in the opposite direction as my husbands family). 

Most recently we are breaking form and going home over the 4th of July because my husbands extended family is having a reunion. We will not be in the area for long (4 days) and so I let my family know that we would be in state and that they are more than welcome to come to the town the reunion is happening in. My mother (not surprisingly) is looking to see if there is a day that works for her to drive down. My father and sister however have both made asks that we drive to them at a camping area that they often go to in the summer. My sister also implied we should then go see her in her home town afterwards. 

I feel like it would be easier to be accommodating if they made an effort to come and see us, but I really don't feel like making the drive to hang around a camper. For clarification there is no financial barrier for my father to come and see us, or even plan a trip to meet us somewhere else in the country. My sister is less able to fly, however she has forced us to drive an 1.5 hours to her while we were visiting my parents home town the last two Christmases (she also has no children). If anything I feel like I should be driving to my mom's house since she puts in so much more effort. 

I don't know how to express this frustration without coming off as selfish or cold. Am I being overly sensitive about having to drive and see my father / sister? Is it weird if I pass on driving to see them and potentially miss seeing them all together?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently frustrated about how often I see my family and what the encounter is like when we do see one another and am looking for some advice.

My parents divorced by the time i was about 10 years old. He left for the first time when I was about the age of 5 to live with another woman. At the time we went to visit him and his new girlfriend about once a month and the relationship was as normal as it could be with a father you see that often. After a few years he left his then girlfriend to get back together with my mother.

Later on at the age of nine he left again for another woman and this time forever. The new girlfriend from that is now his wife and the divorce of my parents was pretty bad, because the new woman in my fathers life was quit involved into the fight for child custody.
My sister and me both stayed with my mom, as my father lost the fight, which I'm quite happy about because i would not have wanted to grow up with my father and his wife. 
Fast forward to today: I am now 22, moved out from my mothers home to study on a city quite far away. The contact to my mother is sporadic, but we see each other about once a month and talk on the phone about every other weekend. 

The contact to my father on the other hand is rare to say the least, since the divorce we saw each others about every 2 months to the age of about 15, because he had no money to support the train ticket to meet him, not to mention to provide food for a whole weekend for me and my sister. My mother did not want to pay for it as my dad never payed child support, or payed as few as possible. 
After the age of 17, as i did my A-levels, we saw ech other maybe once or twice a year for a few hours when he visited his father, who lived in a city not that far from my school.

After my A-levels which where about 4 years ago, i saw my father maybe once again. 
He never met my boyfriend of 6 and a half years once, nor does he know what kind of a person I actually am.

My yonger sister made a hard cut on contact about 5 years ago and had no contact from that on. He since then tried to guilt trip me into providing him her adress so he can send her a letter asking what the reasons is she broke contact. I think he knows the reason she broke contact, but he doesn't want see it: My sister was from early age on quite attached to my father and that was used by him and his now wife in the battle for custody against my mom. He tried to convince her that she should live with him and his wife, so that he would not have to pay child support and even further could charge my mother for support as they both had one child and my mother earned more money. 
After this didn't work the contact got very rare, because he had money problems. 

For 2 years or even longer he said he wants to write that letter, asking what her motivation for not having contact is, but he just never sends it because he says he lost the adress every few months. 

The last time he wrote to me was after christmas saying he will call me, he never did. The last few months before that, from my perspective, i really tried to hold contact with him. Like sending pictures of me and friends, saying what im doing in uni and asking what is going on in his life. But from the point on where i wasn't starting conversation he did not call or send messages.
So after the christmas message i wanted to see how long it would take him: about 4 months as you can see.

Today I got a message from him asking if I am angry with him. 
Unfortunately in between christmas and the last months he had his birthday, but as he would also frequently forget about my birthday I didn't want to give in. He always says he wished for better contact between him and his kids but I am not seeing him putting any work into it. 
So the question I am aksing myself is: Is it even worth it, holding contact with that man who is my father, but doesn't really know me and i am not seeing that he puts any effort into changing that ?

I'm 15, a male. And my dad and I often get into situvations where we argue or are angry at eachother, and this is probaly the best excample I can show you of what happens, real story, happened 2 days ago;

I've been trying to lose weight for some time, while working out (muscle training), and I've lost 7 kg in 2 months, while getting more toned abs and bigger biceps etc. So I said to my dad, 'hey, btw I lost 7 kgs now', he said: 'good, but don't lose anymore weight now'. I responed in a ironic manner; 'I wondered you would say that'. He responded, 'Well if you want to I can set up the scle so you can see your muscle mass etc and spend some time explaning how it works.', I responded 'No thanks, I belive they are inaccrurate and show you a percentage than what the reality is', again a little jokingly, since this isn't the case. He said in a serious tone: 'Well if you were serious about your training you would not lose anymore weight, and you would want to know your percentages'. I was angry on the inside but kept it chill; 'I take it seriously, but that doesn't mean that I have to go all crazy about it.' And that was it, I went in the kitchen and took some tap water, and walked away.

The reason I got angry after he said that, was because I thought it was not very nice or respectfull to just shit on 8 weeks of training and dieting like that.

Thanks.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So hey, I want to share a experience I had yesterday, but that also applies for most of my life so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 15, a male. And my dad and I often get into situvations where we argue or are angry at eachother, and this is probaly the best excample I can show you of what happens, real story, happened 2 days ago;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been trying to lose weight for some time, while working out (muscle training), and I&amp;#39;ve lost 7 kg in 2 months, while getting more toned abs and bigger biceps etc. So I said to my dad, &amp;#39;hey, btw I lost 7 kgs now&amp;#39;, he said: &amp;#39;good, but don&amp;#39;t lose anymore weight now&amp;#39;. I responed in a ironic manner; &amp;#39;I wondered you would say that&amp;#39;. He responded, &amp;#39;Well if you want to I can set up the scle so you can see your muscle mass etc and spend some time explaning how it works.&amp;#39;, I responded &amp;#39;No thanks, I belive they are inaccrurate and show you a percentage than what the reality is&amp;#39;, again a little jokingly, since this isn&amp;#39;t the case. He said in a serious tone: &amp;#39;Well if you were serious about your training you would not lose anymore weight, and you would want to know your percentages&amp;#39;. I was angry on the inside but kept it chill; &amp;#39;I take it seriously, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that I have to go all crazy about it.&amp;#39; And that was it, I went in the kitchen and took some tap water, and walked away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I got angry after he said that, was because I thought it was not very nice or respectfull to just shit on 8 weeks of training and dieting like that. Felt like he was saying that I had made no progress. Made me furious afterwards, but kept it in, until now, and I though, how can I fix this shit the missing bond my dad and I clearly lack. Any thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a very complex situation with a lot of emotional undertones and is a source of great worry and sadness for me..

I will briefly and simply break it down. I'm a 20 year old only child and I'm still living at home and working, since my family is not financially well off.

I love both of my parents but they are so different. They are from different cultural backgrounds. My father has a sharp temper, even though he is loving and very affectionate.
My mother has been suffering from depression and is on medication.

Neither of my parents have careers. They work seasonally, since winter time is dead as far as employment opportunity goes. For a large portion of their days, they are stuck with me. I hang out with my friends and have hobbies that I deal with too, of course. But soon, I will be leaving home. I honestly have no idea how my parents will cope. 
Its obvious that the highlight of their days is being with me. We recently got back from a foreign country were we worked were basically together all day for 6 months.


My mother has told me many times ""I don't know what I would do without you"" and that type of thing. I have a fantastic relationship with her and she has even gone as far as to say that she wishes that my dad was as pleasant as me. 
My parents relationship is on the shaky side. 

I fear that leaving them will take away their livelihood, cripple their marriage, make my mothers depression exponentially worse. All for the sake of me experiencing life.

My family environment is a source of anxiety and sorrow for me and I feel that if I'm stuck in this bubble for ever I will waste my life away in sadness and regret.

I know that if I distance myself from this, I will feel better. However, my parents will certainly not. And the guilt is devastating.

I am experiencing a barrage of confounding emotions and I feel like I'm carrying the fate of two souls on my back. I have nobody to speak to, my friends are unwilling or unable to understand, and I love my parents, especially my mum more than anything, but I can't tell her this, because it will burden her with guilt, and her depression will get much worse. 

Edit: I must add now while this post is at its infancy that this situation has been troubling me for the last couple of years as is not something that I've written as a spur of the moment type of thing

There are some moments in your life you never forget. Others that have a profound effect on the path you choose to follow. And some that fit into both those categories.

For me, one of them is 2 October, 2007. Although this story really starts two days earlier – September 30, a Sunday. I was tired, exhausted and had six weeks left of my second pregnancy. Things hadn’t felt right for the previous week. I’d kept calling my doctor, but she was either too busy to talk or just gave me quick, off-the-cuff answers. “No bleeding? Ok, you’re fine.” “No cramping? Then I’m sure it’s just normal exhaustion.”

I felt fobbed off and, somehow, just knew I shouldn’t let it slide. I paced the floor, waiting for Monday and my next appointment to roll round. I’ve been around 4cm dilated for the past three weeks and have been given medication to prevent my contractions from coming – it makes me sleepy, which isn’t great, but I suppose it’s better than stressing out.

This is my 1st reddit post so I’m sorry if I didn’t use the right lingo.

The order of age is father (53), mother (44), oldest brother (27), middle brother (25), youngest brother (24), me (22), little sister (19). I will refer to them as so throughout the rest of the post. I am currently moved out of the house and am married. I recently went back to visit my family that now lives out of state. What I came back to was not pleasant. Like every family there are lots of problems but there is one that I do not know how to deal with. The youngest brother seems to be a constant problem in the family. The rest of the family is very passive and pretty much just lets everyone do their own thing. When I went back to visit, I noticed that he is basically treating my little sister like a doormat. He makes her do nearly everything for her. Laundry, clean his room, cook his meals, go out with him, and other things that would seem like something a typical wife would do. When I say laundry and the other things, I don’t mean she just throws his load of laundry in the washer and drier. She literally goes into his room grabs his dirty close, washes them, dries them, folds them up, and puts them back nicely. Other than all the chores she does for him sometimes he would just randomly take her out for hours without telling anyone where they are going or when they will be back. Just beyond all the chores he makes her do around the house he is very abusive to her. Not physically abusive, but emotionally. He constantly puts her down telling her she is stupid when she doesn’t want to do what he says. He uses the excuse that he is training her to become a good wife one day when she tries to stand up for herself. The worst part of all this is that no one does anything about this. Father completely ignores the situation along with oldest brother. Middle brother and mother when they try to talk to him about his behaviors, he just starts getting aggressive and resorts to threats of violence. It’s gotten to the point where he has struck mother and has beat up middle brother, even at the age they are at right now. So now middle brother and mother seem to have given up trying to deal with this behavior. Going beyond that of just describing youngest brother, little sister is showing signs of an abused person. She just agrees with him when he insults her, she willing does nearly anything he asks of her, and she has even said to not confront youngest brother about what is happening to her. I do not know what to do about this situation. Youngest brother causes many more problems, but this is one I think I need to deal with quickly before any more damage is done to little sisters’ mindset.

She loves books and loves being read to. However, I have noticed that she always has trouble reading.
     Her Lexile/SRI scores are much below the range for her grade level. She mixes up simple words from one another (like want and wont), has trouble remembering right and left, and often says one words when she means a completely different one.

 Her Lexile/SRI scores are much below the range for her grade level. She mixes up simple words from one another (like want and wont), has trouble remembering right and left, and often says one words when she means a completely different one.

She blames me for influencing her son into running away with me to start a new life. When in fact, she was verbally and emotionally abusive until today. She's called me countless of names when the kids are not around and would ignore me and not listen to single word I have to say.

Her Husband thinks I should go to jail for what I've done. What have I done you may ask? I dont even know, myself. As far as I know, I've been working my ass off for nearly a decade supporting my own family and occasionally putting up with their bullshit. 

 My children are 18[M]and 14[F], and my Husband will not allow any sort of alcoholic beverages and cigarettes inside the house. Basically, I havent had a drink for nearly 6 years ( I think? ) and I dont smoke either.

The only reason they are present in our lives at the moment, after completely desowning their son when he was 18. Was for the kids. The kids that we adopted 14 years ago and only know they decided that since they have grandchildren. Let's pretend that nothing ever happened.

I talked to my partner about it and we both agreed that it was maybe not the best choice to have the kids around them all the time. 

They are strict Catholics btw. So of course they'll try to push their agenda on them as well. To the point where they started buying my Son Christian video games that arent compatible with his playstation. They bought my daughter a CD full of Christian themed songs. And when I tell them they'll just waste their money. They act as if I insulted Jesus's name

But maybe the worst thing they've done. It was just 2 days ago when they were forcing my daughter to wear dresses that she was not comfortable in. They bought her long dresses and I've told them beforehand that She ( my daughter ) only wears unisex clothes, she hates skirts and dresses and likes wearing shorts or jeans, she loves checkered clothing and long sleeves. But they bought the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of what I told them. Light pink dresses and bows, a knee length skirt and shirt with something about jesus on it. 

And we had to go to a party that night. And my daughter was giving all of us the silent treatment. She was pissed, but both I and my partner knew we couldn't do anything about it. She couldn't protest because her grandparents kept on insisting her. They even took away her ukulele and even I dont know where it was, and only agreed to give it back when she learned to ""Act like a girl"" and ""be the beautiful daughter of god"" that she was, I felt sick when I heard them brainwashing(?) my kids with their religion .  It wasn't until we were at the party. That my daughter locked herself in the girls bathroom until I agreed to drive her home to change. She gets mad very easily her boundaries are being pressed. So she just angrily cried in the back seat, I comforted her when we got home and let her eat a bar of chocolate in the car ride back

When we got back to the party, my husband was talking to his parents, but when they saw me. They instantly told me ( privately ) that I was the worst father in the world and my daughter didn't deserved to be held captive by my rules. I drew the line right there, as my anger started to kick in. I left to go to the back yard of the house we were in and when just tried to calm myself down. I didnt want to start a fuss. Especially since last week's incident. 

I may seem like a horrible person, but all I want is to have a proper functioning relationship with my husband's parents.I dont hate Christians and I respect their religion. But I cannot believe that they would go that far. No doubt I feel like shit whenever they treat me like that. And I couldn't imagine what my partner went through when he had to put up with that. 

I know this sounds like a rant, but I really need outside advise for this type of thing. 

We cant just push them out of our lives either, because we both want our kids to get to know their grandparents at the very least.

Hi r/family ! The University of Sheffield are running an online study looking at how language is a part of a person's identity and how they communicate this with their family. We are collecting our data through a fun quiz (see link above) that helps you consider the role of language in your life - at the end of the quiz, the website will show you where we think you are on a graph of language identity! We are looking at ""family language"" - the language spoken in your family, but which might be a minority language in the society you live in. Anyone can participate, but we are particularly interested in people from the UK who currently have children or would consider having children.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know if you'd like more information about the research, or if you want to share your thoughts on whether passing on your language to your children is important to you.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://language-quiz.switchstancehq.com/""&gt;http://language-quiz.switchstancehq.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

We are collecting our data through a fun quiz (see link above) that helps you consider the role of language in your life - at the end of the quiz, the website will show you where we think you are on a graph of language identity! We are looking at &amp;quot;family language&amp;quot; - the language spoken in your family, but which might be a minority language in the society you live in. Anyone can participate, but we are particularly interested in people from the UK who currently have children or would consider having children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you&amp;#39;d like more information about the research, or if you want to share your thoughts on whether passing on your language to your children is important to you.&lt;/p&gt;

A couple of months ago, she got in trouble for stealing a family member's car, evading the police, and going on a chase. She has a court date tomorrow and every time she goes to court she gets tested.

Now, when called me and asked what I would be doing tomorrow I already knew she was going to ask for a favor. She asked for my work schedule and I lied because I was thinking she needed a ride.

About 10 years ago my grandfather passed away, but before he did he told me about his rifle and how it will be mine after he passes. He told me not to let anyone take it away from me. 

When he passed away I was 19 and my sister's husband was part owner at a gunshop, so not having a firearms license at the time I agreed that it be kept in the safe at the shop. Next thing I overhear my mother and my brother-in-law discussing the sale of my gun. Helpless to stop them, they sold my gun in spite of my protests.

So it's 10 years later and my brother and father passed away a couple of months ago. I've been thinking about my grandpa a lot lately...

 I wake up at 5am in a furious rage about having lost the rifle in spite of his warnings. My family just shrugs when I mention it, my mother even tried to make me believe that my grandma (her stepmom) took the rifle.

I hate my brother, I hate my mom, I even hate my dead father for leaving me in this situation, and my dads sister.

I am 33 and today I had to borrow 20€ from my mom. Why?

It is super humilionating. I am crying while I am writing this, but I need to put this thing out.

I have a steady corporate capitalistic job that I hate doing but do it to support my “family”. I have no life since we all no how would cares that you work 12h a day, I sleep on a fucking sofa in my mom livingroom.

So when my dad died (10 years ago). I took the load of supporting my fucking mom and my brother. I payed of my dads debts, my brothers education, everything.

2 and a half years ago my grandmother died, and sinc she has some income, there where couple of wills going around. If we wanted to get anything we needed to be part of a lawsuit. I didn’t want to. It was souch a histerical drama my mom and my brother for me not wanting to take what I am owned to. (AND I AM NOT SRY FOR ALL YOU WHO IN THAT SYSTEM, IT IS SHIT).

So what I did get after signing my death wish. Well my aunt physicaly and psycologicaly attacking me infront of the court. I don’t know which was worse, broozed face, my broken glasses, that she said she spits on my fathers grave, or that nobody helped, not even my giagantic brother, and I am a petit woman. Or that police that was there did not stoped my aunt. 

The rest of the shit, the e-mails, the paperwork, I had to deal with alone. In the end we lost, because my so called lawyer which I would one day make her loose her job, toled not me but my cousin (they where friends) that we lost. 2 months late. The cost has doubled. And you know who was the sole person responsible for paying the debth. ME. 

Today I also found out that my so called lawyer forgot to put in exhibits. So I am oficialy not a grad child of my grandmother. And the bitch is telling everybody that she gave me the lowest prices, cause I am pore. 

Well NINA! I haven’t said a thing till this moment.

As for my fucking mom and my brother. Well my brother hasn’t replayed to any of my texts. And I asked him 3 weeks ago does he plan to come for family lunch.

The only replay about the money was that he is not going to pay it, cause he is saving up for a car.

My mom as a confort said, Well this is great, you can always Stay with me and sleep on the sofa. I will cook lunch for you.

Well I pay all the bills, and beside the fact when my brother comes home, she doesn’t cook.

I don’t remember when she huged me the last time. I use to go to a ceramics class where our teacher would hug us when she saw us. YES I FUCKING PAYED SO SOMEBODY WOULD HUG ME. And I don’t even have that.

It would be great to write a story with a neat and happy ending, but sadly I can’t do that. At this moment in time we are still searching for answers and hoping for a breakthrough that means my darling seven-year-old son gets the treatment he needs. To say the past 30 months or so have been a roller-coaster is an understatement.

Carter was a perfectly normal, healthy kid. He was full of character and had plenty of energy to run around with his twin brothers, Liam and Jaxson, who are two years older than he is. When he was younger there were some issues with asthma, but nothing his paediatrician couldn’t help us control.

Then, in September 2016, everything changed. It started with a routine eye exam for all three boys – I always took them at the start of the school year. Our usual eye doctor wasn’t available, so I called around to find someone who could fit us in. He noticed Carter’s optic nerves were swollen and said we should see a specialist to find out what was going on. I followed his advice, and got Carter checked out.

She keeps my rambunctious 8yo brother for the weekend. She paid for my brother’s and his girlfriend’s prom (despite her not liking them). She used to pay for me to take music lessons (I don’t anymore, I play on my own). She paid for me to go to Disney last year with a friend. This summer, she is sending me to France for a month to study. All of this I am very thankful for, but there is one thing that we still have problems with. 

 Every day, she picks me up from school because when my mom “had” to get a job (she didn’t have to, she did it in an anger-filled rush), which granted, she offered to do. I also have a job which I must be at usually 4 weekdays when I have school. Do every day, my grandmother needs to pick me up at 3:30 or 4, and take me to work at 5 (if I go), but sometimes she is late. She (like most other people) has a job as a nurse, and things happen that prevent her from getting me.

 Lately, it has been a lot worse, with me getting to work late (especially when my parents leave town). To make it easier on her (and get me to work on time), I decided to start having my mom pick me up Tuesdays and the occasional Wednesday, since that it when she is off.  Today, I messaged her asking if she would pick me up, and after she confirmed, my Dad told me to “lay low” when coming home because my mother was angry that she had to pick me up today. 

This is where it gets interesting: My mom thought she had to pick me up because my Grandmother could not, which was not true and unreasonable (again, my Grandmother has a job). I asked my mom to pick me up because I wanted to make it easier to my Grandmother. Now, according to my Dad, it is “not my place” to ask for my Mom to get me (which I have done for weeks now) because my Grandmother offered to get me and needs to live up to that commitment.

 So basically, my mom is mad because my Grandmother offered to pick me up from school so she could work, but gets mad when she’s (reasonably) late, but also gets mad when anyone but my Grandmother comes to get me. As much as my Grandmother does for my family (even though a lot of times there’s some ulterior motive behind it and expectation that we do what she wants), it seems to me like my parents can’t really get mad since she basically does a lot for us.

It's not new, and it's even more so than other major cities. To live in even just a bachelor or a shared apartment would take more than I can really manage.  

I work full time, 9-5 with a salary, yet I cannot afford to live out on my own.  My mother refuses to take rent from me, but I pay for basically everything else (phone, groceries, pitch in with electric and hydo, etc.). I love my mom, but I can't take the lack of independence and privacy anymore.

Dating is basically impossible. My mother notoriously doesn't let me do what I want. I and my sister get asked a list of questions any time we go out. I'm forced to be secretive, because my mom can be very judgmental about dating/drinking/going out.

I want to say ""I'm going out for a few hours, be home later"" but my mom goes ""where you going? who are you going with? will you be late? how long will you be? how will you get there?"" etc. etc.  It's very irritating. I've asked countless times for privacy, to be given my space as much as I can given the fact that we live under the same roof. This usually ends with my mom getting mad at me, or upset and saying that I've hurt her feelings, saying ""after all I've done for you"".

My sister, to put a long story short, is very difficult to live with. We have clashing personalities, and she's very aggressive/has anger issues. Her and her boyfriend CONSTANTLY fight, which I have to listen to, and she stays up very late yelling and gaming because she has a retail schedule.

I don't know what to do anymore.  Even just trying to plan a vacation, my mother is suspicious as to why I want to travel, what I want to do, who I'm going to see there, and doesn't believe that I just want to take a vacation to escape the drone of my job. I just know that once I'm on vacation, she'll want constant updates as to where I am and what I'm doing. I hate feeling ungrateful, or unappreciative. 

But I'm 28. All I want is to be out on my own and have my privacy/independence that I always thought I would have at this stage in life.

What do I do? What can I do? I'm feeling like my only option is eventually going to be to move out of the city, but then what? Find a new job and start from scratch?

&amp;#x200B;

Any and all advice would be very, very much appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I live in a large city, where the rental market is ridiculously and notoriously overpriced and unlivable. It&amp;#39;s not new, and it&amp;#39;s even more so than other major cities. To live in even just a bachelor or a shared apartment would take more than I can really manage.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work full time, 9-5 with a salary, yet I cannot afford to live out on my own.  My mother refuses to take rent from me, but I pay for basically everything else (phone, groceries, pitch in with electric and hydo, etc.). I love my mom, but I can&amp;#39;t take the lack of independence and privacy anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dating is basically impossible. My mother notoriously doesn&amp;#39;t let me do what I want. I and my sister get asked a list of questions any time we go out. I&amp;#39;m forced to be secretive, because my mom can be very judgmental about dating/drinking/going out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to say &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going out for a few hours, be home later&amp;quot; but my mom goes &amp;quot;where you going? who are you going with? will you be late? how long will you be? how will you get there?&amp;quot; etc. etc.  It&amp;#39;s very irritating. I&amp;#39;ve asked countless times for privacy, to be given my space as much as I can given the fact that we live under the same roof. This usually ends with my mom getting mad at me, or upset and saying that I&amp;#39;ve hurt her feelings, saying &amp;quot;after all I&amp;#39;ve done for you&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sister, to put a long story short, is very difficult to live with. We have clashing personalities, and she&amp;#39;s very aggressive/has anger issues. Her and her boyfriend CONSTANTLY fight, which I have to listen to, and she stays up very late yelling and gaming because she has a retail schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore.  Even just trying to plan a vacation, my mother is suspicious as to why I want to travel, what I want to do, who I&amp;#39;m going to see there, and doesn&amp;#39;t believe that I just want to take a vacation to escape the drone of my job. I just know that once I&amp;#39;m on vacation, she&amp;#39;ll want constant updates as to where I am and what I&amp;#39;m doing. I hate feeling ungrateful, or unappreciative. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m 28. All I want is to be out on my own and have my privacy/independence that I always thought I would have at this stage in life.&lt;/p&gt;

Everyone wants their child to be special, don’t they? We hold them in our arms as babies and wonder what they’ll be like as they grow, how they’ll stand out in life. Sometimes, that happens in the most unexpected ways.

At first, our story wasn’t anything out of the ordinary. I married Darren, my high school sweetheart, a year after we graduated. A year later and our son, Kenton, was born. He was followed by our second child, a daughter, Kodi Anne, almost two years later. So far, so good.

I’d always imagined we’d have more children, so it was tough to learn I had next to no chance of getting pregnant again after the doctors removed some pre-cancerous cells they’d found in my cervix. Even if I did conceive, they said, I wouldn’t carry a baby to term. It seemed they were right. The next few years included several early miscarriages, and I told myself I had to accept our family was complete. We had two wonderful, healthy children, and I should be content.

Our grandmother on our moms side just died and you forgot about us. You’re life with us. You’re obsession with being a poet about death and your feeling like you needed a Harvard degree to be relevant and like you could be published about the closest truth to death as you think it.

Always thinking you know more, better, and the fools that are convinced you are, like me, who was your child and you were my whole world and answers to wonder who come to you for advice, are fooled by what you actually fear In what you really don’t know. What scared you? I’m starting to figure out that you were fake, my first love was fake and a liar about everything saying things they didn’t really mean but just made it up to make me feel comfortable all to make themselves feel good. I have sought out validation from you most of my life but mostly am  actually feeling ridiculed for being brave for speaking up for a different perspective in my thought that doesnt otherwise align with yours. You criticize me with your ego as if youre still resolving old karma from when you were wronged when you felt right and hoping that lesson will resonate with those people you “teach” trying to come to you for validation in truth spoken to only themselves entrusted in you that you will be soothsaying to them. Yet you speak with ten dollar words to tell i shouldn’t speak with ten dollar words. I asked you when I read you my proposal for a paper in my masters program what I could do better and you told me everything I could do better. Nothing that I did right. I could never wow you. But I understand because you could never wow yourself and yet we still love each other so deeply and so irrationally. I have to deal so much with this all the time in my adulthood and I don’t even blame you at all.  This is why I truly believe I chase men that could never give me what I need as I am worthy of in myself because I am chasing people that are always feeling empty and as if I can actually love them enough almost childishly that they can feel worthy too. I wish I could heal your pain and karmic debt of things that I probably saw as a kid that had nothing to do with me but felt we’re part of me and wanted to serve as a part of you of me when all you did was love me as much as you could apart from the adult oblivion of you being just a person going through some shit. Looking at life on the same wave length through blood line adult eye to kid eye. You must have felt misunderstood and so did I. 

And now I feel like I’m dealing with this alone between flashes of struggling to run back to a mother that is all loving and giving through her crosses to bear of pain unfathomable to most through loss that I know will die and a father that is emotionally void through entitlement from guilt and I have been codependent on both. A feeling of insecurity that I never could actualize on my own or maybe was confused about intuitively as a child. I know I exist alone as I was born alone. But I inherently know as a soul living a human experience I could never exist nor want to exist without them both physically or esoterically. It is a yearning for love, from my dad, almost feeling like achieving it belongs outside of this world and like it was left in the ethers and hesitantly made its way to this physical plane like it didn’t want to be here. But I think it’s an ego for me too. Because I really just want to fix you, dad, because as a little girl I just saw a broken heart of a man who just wanted to give me the world and did and couldn’t let anyone fix his own world and who never could for him at my age.

How much love he must have felt he could and wanted to give but couldn’t fix or mend what was already broken in his surrounding loved ones by the era of his life despite his potential but just watched love as he thought, deprive.

At first I just told myself that it was just normal family issues but lately i've noticed that this has really started to get out of control and i'm worried about him.

Just so you know my boyfriend is 18 (i'm 19), he has autism and we both live in the UK.

His family refused to give him a diagnosis for him autism while growing up telling him that doing so would just hinder him. However this being said they (partially his mother) talk about his autism like its a choice of his, often telling him he needs to get over it ""you won't be able to do this in the real world"". They refuses to accommodate for his autism and often treat it as an inconvenience for them. As a result he other has to deal with really loud noises around the house which he finds distressing and overwhelming, and can trigger sensory overload. As well as this he reports that his parents are constantly fighting and threatening to divorce each other which he also finds distressing. He struggles to understand when threats are made in the heat of the moment or if there real. He tried talking to his parents calmly about this, but they refuses to do anything about it and never explain to him is these devours threats are serious or not.

This leads me on to his mother.

His mother is a trained therapist yet dose not seem to be able to recognises when her son is in distress or his overwhelmed (something his friends and I see no problem seeing). Today he had a panic attack and instead of trying to calm him down she shouted at him to stop fidgeting and pacing the room and made him stand still for a wile in the kitchen wile having this panic attack. His mothers mood is really inconsistent, one minute she's friendly and approachable the next she extremely angry and loud (He finds this frightening). His mother believes in lots of conspiracy such as 9/11 conspiracies and that all medical companies are corrupt because ""they don't make medicine to prevent illnesses so they must want people to stay sick"". (\*cough cough\* vaccines \*cough cough\*). She talks about these conspiracies to him and his siblings (22 and 14) and even told him he should tell me to get off my antidepressants because I will get addicted to and reliant on them. I find this particularly worrying as she is a practicing therapist.

His sister he says is constantly nasty to him, constantly bringing him down and derating him unless she wants something from him. She is 14 however when he brings up this behaviour to his parents they don't want to do anything about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever he brings up any of these issues with his mother and try to talk to her calmly about how these issues make him feel and how she and the rest of the family can support him she always make out themselves to be the victim. It is always his fault and he needs to change for her.

He as spoken to me about wanting to run away from his house and how he feels like his family wish he was not there. He has also told me how he has been getting lots of nightmares about death and being raped which often involve his family.

I have helped him to sign up to get a NHS councillor which he is currently waiting for a response from. However Im worried that this is not going to be enough. Is there anything we can do?

I asked her if she could ship my stuff out for me that day, and that I would pay her any money back that she spends on it if she showed me a receipt, she agreed. It is now the 29th of April, and for the last 5 days I have been nonstop arguing with her to send my stuff, she now wants me to give her money for all of my stuff, and shipping on top of that. I don't trust her to actually spend the money on shipping my belongings back to me, which leaves me in a rough spot, and the only idea I have is to go to the police, which I don't see them helping much if I am out of province. She also calls me daily telling me that I am possessed and that my belongings are as well, it really wouldn't be much of an issue if they were just clothes, but I have about 2000\~ dollars worth of stuff I was trying to ship here.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, my fiances mom wants to buy a sleeper sofa for the office so that his brother can sleep more comfortably for 5 days!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does that seem a bit much? Should I say no?&lt;/p&gt;

I was recently willed a piano from my grandmother (she passed quite a few years ago, but my grandpa just moved into a retirement home and is ok with me taking it now) and, like responsible adults, we made the arrangements to go get this piano which was states away in one weekend because that’s just how it turned out (so driving, such tired). Because that’s what you do when you have said that you want something from someone else, you go and get it. You don’t expect that person to bring it to you.

So here comes the part where I’m peeved. We already have a piano that was my husband’s family piano and since he was really the only o e that played it, he just took it with him when we moved states. Apparently this caused a few waves. I’ve learned a long time ago to get the hell off the beach when there’s waves in his family, so I really don’t know for sure what went down. Just that Grandma, the self proclaimed matriarch of the family, wanted the piano to go to my husband’s older brother and his family (her favorites). Now that we have a different piano, we don’t need two, my husband asked his brother if he wanted the family piano. Of course he says yes, his kids are interested in piano lessons yada yada yada. But here’s the thing, no one (and by that I mean anyone on my husband’s side that lives in their home state. Sharing is caring in their family) has the means to come a get the piano. Which really translates to we don’t want to, but we still want the piano so do something about that. Not once has his brother brought forward a plan to come get this piano that he apparently really wants. He’s expecting my husband, his younger brother, to figure it out. Pisses me off. He’s taking no responsibility whatsoever. 

We had no trouble going states away to get my grandma’s piano, we rented a uhaul trailer and off we went. And we’re not rich by any means either, but we pulled it off. That’s another complaint that his brother has, that they don’t have the money. Bullshit. There is always a way.

So I end up having to go to my parents who are going to our home state where my husband’s family and a bit of mine live, and ask them to bring the piano with them (they live about six hours away from us and just moved from home state last year so they still have stuff there). They are very kind people and agree to do so, if they end up driving their truck and trailer. They might rent a uhaul truck instead, but nothing is set in stone. Everyone thinks the matter is settled. But wait, there’s more. My brother in law just sold his house, and the house they are building won’t be ready for some time. So now there’s no house to put the piano in, but they still want it. Guess who’s in charge of finding a place to store the piano? The person who now owns the piano? You’d think that but no, it’s up to my husband to figure out where my parents are going to drop it off which is going way out of their way. 

Because it’s going to be such a hassle, I insisted to my husband that his brother give my dad at least $100 to help with gas and whatnot. My husband thought that this wasn’t necessary, that his brother couldn’t afford it blah blah blah. Well neither could we! Neither can my parents, but they’re doing it anyway because they’re amazing. Part of being an adult is sucking it up and doing what needs to be done.

TDLR: We have a free piano that my brother in-law a few states away wants. I think the responsibility of coming and getting the piano resides solely on my in-laws shoulders .

&amp;#x200B;

My sister (let's call her Jessie) is 22 and just had her baby only 3 weeks ago. Before the pregnancy, she had been in a 4-ish year relationship with her abusive boyfriend (let's call him, Mike). 

He has been absolutely horrible to her, not only does he do every drug imaginable, but he also pressures my sister into doing them. She always defends him, but I know he is abusive because she has called me in tears, locked in the bathroom, with him banging on the door yelling at her. She just blames it on the drugs and alcohol.

When she got pregnant he was furious, saying she was ruining his life, through the entire pregnancy he verbally abused her constantly. She lived about 8 hours away, so once she got maternity leave she moved in with us.

She lost all their mutual friends because he lied about the reason she got pregnant, claiming she wanted to trap him and get money off him. He earns more than Jessie yet she gives every extra dollar she gets to him, because he ""needs to eat better"" or stuff like that. She said she didn't want anything from him, wasn't even going to put him on the birth certificate (he won't get chased for child support, but Jessie will get less from the government). The guys a deadbeat, he doesn't even have his drivers license (he's 26)

Jessie's labor was very difficult (two full days of contractions) yet while she was in the hospital he was taking her gas (pain relief) and she even gave him her credit card to buy himself some food and he came back with weed. 

Now that the baby is born all of a sudden he wants to be involved. He has flown up every weekend which is really nice of him. He isn't paying though. Just when I think he is trying to be a good dad he ruins it. He doesn't listen when Jessie tells him how to hold her and instead lets her head flop around. Sings and blasts horrible rap music to her which wakes her up, because he wants her to have good taste. A couple of times she has asked Mike to pick her up if she cries but he just says ""no, I'll let her cry for a minute before picking her up, I don't want her to get bad habits"", she's 3 weeks old, she won't get bad habits.

He expects to be allowed around her when he is high or drunk. In fact, just the other day my sister said she saw him pick up a children's book while in her room, she said she got excited thinking he was going to read to her but when she asked he said: ""Nah, I just wanna chop up my weed.""

Every time my sister puts her foot down and tells him no ""you can't chop you weed, or smoke, or anything like that around her) he gets angry and starts talking about how he is her father and Jessie can't tell him what to do around his daughter. Yesterday Jessie had to pick my dad up from the hospital because neither my mum or I were there. She called me crying because she was so scared to leave them alone, he had been drinking.

She doesn't say anything to him because she doesn't want confrontation, I think she is really scared of him.

My sister has told me not to do anything, but this is my niece we are talking about, she deserves so much better than this. I don't know what to do, my mum is exactly the same.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m coming to Reddit for help because no matter what my mum and I say to my sister, she isn&amp;#39;t doing anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sister (let&amp;#39;s call her Jessie) is 22 and just had her baby only 3 weeks ago. Before the pregnancy, she had been in a 4-ish year relationship with her abusive boyfriend (let&amp;#39;s call him, Mike). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has been absolutely horrible to her, not only does he do every drug imaginable, but he also pressures my sister into doing them. She always defends him, but I know he is abusive because she has called me in tears, locked in the bathroom, with him banging on the door yelling at her. She just blames it on the drugs and alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she got pregnant he was furious, saying she was ruining his life, through the entire pregnancy he verbally abused her constantly. She lived about 8 hours away, so once she got maternity leave she moved in with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She lost all their mutual friends because he lied about the reason she got pregnant, claiming she wanted to trap him and get money off him. He earns more than Jessie yet she gives every extra dollar she gets to him, because he &amp;quot;needs to eat better&amp;quot; or stuff like that. She said she didn&amp;#39;t want anything from him, wasn&amp;#39;t even going to put him on the birth certificate (he won&amp;#39;t get chased for child support, but Jessie will get less from the government). The guys a deadbeat, he doesn&amp;#39;t even have his drivers license (he&amp;#39;s 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessie&amp;#39;s labor was very difficult (two full days of contractions) yet while she was in the hospital he was taking her gas (pain relief) and she even gave him her credit card to buy himself some food and he came back with weed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the baby is born all of a sudden he wants to be involved. He has flown up every weekend which is really nice of him. He isn&amp;#39;t paying though. Just when I think he is trying to be a good dad he ruins it. He doesn&amp;#39;t listen when Jessie tells him how to hold her and instead lets her head flop around. Sings and blasts horrible rap music to her which wakes her up, because he wants her to have good taste. A couple of times she has asked Mike to pick her up if she cries but he just says &amp;quot;no, I&amp;#39;ll let her cry for a minute before picking her up, I don&amp;#39;t want her to get bad habits&amp;quot;, she&amp;#39;s 3 weeks old, she won&amp;#39;t get bad habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He expects to be allowed around her when he is high or drunk. In fact, just the other day my sister said she saw him pick up a children&amp;#39;s book while in her room, she said she got excited thinking he was going to read to her but when she asked he said: &amp;quot;Nah, I just wanna chop up my weed.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

I feel bad for my mom, because she really is a great person and loves my dad a lot, but he just wants to fight with her over the most pointless things.

If something isn't perfect in his eyes, it's our fault. The times I'm the happiest are the times I'm away from home and away from him, and I can't help but feel like that's not right.

I find myself trying to find a father figure in other adults, and I feel a little ashamed for that.

He doesn't like anyone that I want to see, there's always a reason why I should stay home. I can't do simple things like riding my bike around my neighborhood without him getting upset. I tried to understand this mentality for a long time, because it's normal to be protective and I want to love my dad. I think trying to keep me home all the time and badmouthing the people I want to see isn't exactly right, though. I can't put a name to this kind of family dynamic, but I don't think I should feel trapped and alone in my own home. I'm turning 18 in four years, and I've been thinking about leaving my home then.

He&amp;#39;ll bring up conflicts from the past or our insecurities to shut us up if we try to tell him he&amp;#39;s wrong, or do anything that he sees as talking back. If something isn&amp;#39;t perfect in his eyes, it&amp;#39;s our fault. The times I&amp;#39;m the happiest are the times I&amp;#39;m away from home and away from him, and I can&amp;#39;t help but feel like that&amp;#39;s not right. When I see my friends or cousins with their fathers and mothers, they look genuinely happy together. I find myself trying to find a father figure in other adults, and I feel a little ashamed for that. I&amp;#39;m really miserable at home now, and I try to stay in my room for as long as I can just to avoid talking to my dad. He doesn&amp;#39;t approve of me leaving the house unless I&amp;#39;m going to school. If I want to see my mom&amp;#39;s family (who are incredibly nice to me and my siblings, and who I love very much), he talks bad about them, even lying to make them out to be horrible people. He doesn&amp;#39;t like anyone that I want to see, there&amp;#39;s always a reason why I should stay home. I can&amp;#39;t do simple things like riding my bike around my neighborhood without him getting upset. I tried to understand this mentality for a long time, because it&amp;#39;s normal to be protective and I want to love my dad. I think trying to keep me home all the time and badmouthing the people I want to see isn&amp;#39;t exactly right, though. I can&amp;#39;t put a name to this kind of family dynamic, but I don&amp;#39;t think I should feel trapped and alone in my own home. I&amp;#39;m turning 18 in four years, and I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about leaving my home then. I have struggled to know if my family is a healthy one, or if my father is just overprotective and I overthink things.&lt;/p&gt;

My father stayed with us from the beginning of March and left a few days ago it was an amazing surprise visit. My very free spirited wife really enjoyed his visit and loved getting to know him better and I really think her light positive and cheerful attitude made my usually negative and really serious father happier and more relaxed. On the other side she really benefited from his life experiences, stories and wisdom which he is overflowing with. It's remarkable really. I really enjoyed him visiting us in our first home and he really did enjoy it. Actually he was our first house guest that stayed over so it was an interesting and fun experience.

Ok all this is leading up to this event which is the main reason why I decided to write all this. My Dad is a literary man he loves to read and write. He has a massive library at home and has always been a deep thinker.. A trait him and I share..

So one day early morning.. before sunrise early.. while out for our usual walk together he tells me about this philosophy book he read in his early days and it has lived with him till this day and he always recommends it to people and has recommended it to all my siblings and now me. He told me about the book a little and really recommended I read it and that it'll help me understand life better..

I usually take a nap after our walks before I start my day. That day I was really tired and had stayed up late with my wife like we usually do after he falls asleep to spend some time together. My father all excited about the book asked me to find it online and download it as soon as we got back from our walk so I did and we sat at the dinner table reading it together with him reading out loud. Lost in the deep questions and thoughts this unique book kept bringing up..

It's a 400 ish page book.. before we knew it we finished the first 32 pages of the book. Both tired and mind blown we decided we'll continue the next morning. This was our first shared moment between us that really was a father and son moment that was just precious. We finally shared an interest and it really was amazing I really felt my father was filled with joy the entire time reading and so was I really.. it was a unique special moment for me as I'm sure it really was for him.. I'll always hold it as the closest moment shared with my Dad.. 

When I went to our room to sleep I found my wife had fallen asleep waiting for me and when I came she woke up and even though I'm tired I excitedly told my half asleep wife about the book I and all this knowledge and information I just discovered... Later on I discover she also heard about it before and that she didn't listen to a word I said to her that morning lol..

It was a really deep book filled with deep thoughts that drive the mind to understand the world from a very complete perspective it really has a unique understanding to life. 

I've always been deeply interested in philosophy I've even thought about majoring in it but figured i want to get somewhere in life and just buried that idea in my endless grave yard of long lost dreams..

Now my father calls excitedly every day or two asking how the book is coming and encouraging my wife and I to put some time towards finishing it...

Lost in the deep questions and thoughts this unique book kept bringing up..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a 400 ish page book.. before we knew it we finished the first 32 pages of the book. Both tired and mind blown we decided we&amp;#39;ll continue the next morning. This was our first shared moment between us that really was a father and son moment that was just precious. We finally shared an interest and it really was amazing I really felt my father was filled with joy the entire time reading and so was I really.. it was a unique special moment for me as I&amp;#39;m sure it really was for him.. I&amp;#39;ll always hold it as the closest moment shared with my Dad.. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I went to our room to sleep I found my wife had fallen asleep waiting for me and when I came she woke up and even though I&amp;#39;m tired I excitedly told my half asleep wife about the book I and all this knowledge and information I just discovered... Later on I discover she also heard about it before and that she didn&amp;#39;t listen to a word I said to her that morning lol..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a really deep book filled with deep thoughts that drive the mind to understand the world from a very complete perspective it really has a unique understanding to life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always been deeply interested in philosophy I&amp;#39;ve even thought about majoring in it but figured i want to get somewhere in life and just buried that idea in my endless grave yard of long lost dreams..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now my father calls excitedly every day or two asking how the book is coming and encouraging my wife and I to put some time towards finishing it... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan on doing just that and I can&amp;#39;t wait to tell him we read it all..&lt;/p&gt;

TLDR: Brother owes me a lot of money from bills in the past few months, doesn't clean up after himself and eats anything that I put into the fridge.

&amp;#x200B;

So to start about 6 months ago my ex and I decided to take my brother in and give him a place to stay. He was going through a lot mentally and had nowhere else to go. We wanted to provide him with a safe place to stay while he got himself on his feet. We set ground rules and expectations of him upon moving in. We allowed him to live rent-free for the first few months, eat whatever he pleased, and use all of our amenities. In January my girlfriend and I broke things off and I asked him to step up and start helping with groceries and rent due to the fact that he had a new job and had started to earn an income. Things were fine until the lease came to an end and we were forced to move into a place of our own. I decided that it would be nice to have my brother there as a support system to help me get through what I was going through and I could help him get through whatever it was he was going through.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past two months, my brother has essentially given me every single paycheck he has earned due to bill constantly coming out and the expectation for him to pay them was obviously there. I feel terrible about him having to dish out his paychecks to me every two weeks in order to keep up with bills but it's his responsibility to make sure they are paid on time. Upon moving into our new place I had to put the entire first months rent down + the deposit because he had no money at the time. As of now, he has made a significant dent in the funds he owes me and is currently down to 300 dollars. However, he was unable to pay the full amount of rent this month and he isn't able to make his half of the other bills that are due. Leaving it up to me to make sure things don't get shut off. I'm currently a full-time student in college and I also work around 40 hours a week in a restaurant serving. I have a lot on my plate and I can't afford to go to a university on my own so it's important for me to maintain good grades in order to receive scholarships and grants at the end of next year. 

&amp;#x200B;

I reached out to him yesterday and asked him if he needed a break from bills for a while. As in moving in with one of his friends. He usually is only home on his days on (Tuesday/Wednesday) and stays with his friend who takes him to and from work the rest of the days since they work together. I feel like this situation would be more ideal for him due to convenience and less responsibility. He denied my offer and said he is fine, he will have more steady paychecks in weeks to come since he just got a new full-time job. 

&amp;#x200B;

My brother has a tendency to leave messes behind and doesn't really take pride in the home he lives in. I, on the other hand, wouldn't call myself a clean freak but I do enjoy keeping my house in order and tidy. I take pride in where I live and appreciate the little things. It's hard for me not to say something when he leaves messes around the place but I've taken a step back from nagging and have just begun to clean up after him, even though I know I shouldn't have to clean up after another adult.

&amp;#x200B;

My question to you guys is, what do you think I should do. I have a few very close friends who I've talked to about the situation and they have offered to move in with me and take over his responsibilities and bills. He is, however, on the lease and wouldn't be able to just be kicked out of the place because I complain. I don't want to put my brother back in a position where he is mentally unstable but I can't continue to live like this. The $300 dollars he owes me can go to important things like changing my breaks and savings. I'm in a pickle because it's my brother and I love him but at the same time I feel like i'm being taken advantage of in some ways.

But when I try to tell her about my problems and get advice or get her to deal with HER sons, (NOT MINE) she either walks away from me while I’m talking, Interrupts me anywhere from 5-7 times making me start over each time, starts talking with anyone closest to her, or gets angry at me for complaining all the time. All of the SHIT that I would get in trouble for If I did that to her. Yeah, shes a hypocrite and she’s disrespectful and the whole world revolves around her and ONLY her being comfortable and relaxed at all times. She DEMANDS respect from me and doesn’t respect me to start with.There are NO boundaries she can’t cross. She goes through my phone, my email, she changed It so that my teachers text her about important things and not ME first. Hell, I can’t even lock my own door without permission.

 What the fuck is that? I’ve never DARED to disrespect her like I’ve wanted to. She has lied to me all my life, about my dad, about being a stripper, about how she stole things from his house when he was In jail. I want to scream about her being a whore Instead of watching us when we were little, and making our stepdad watch us. We never got tucked In by her because she was addicted to stripping. She doesn’t even know I know everything. She’s an awful toxic mother and I want to get away from her so bad. 

I’m treated like the black sheep of the family and you know what, I wish I hadn’t broken up with Nathan because now I’m trapped. I can’t run away and elope, I can’t get a plane ticket and go run away and hide from my parents In Alaska with Nathan’s family anymore. I should’ve kept what I had. Nathan’s mom offered to hide me If I was going to run away. She encouraged me to, but now It’s too late and I’m trapped. The only way I could escape Is to run away on my own at 18, so the cops wouldn’t be that concerned with my case. I would be at a legal age to do anything except drink. Maybe I’ll just find a sugar daddy and run away at 18. Delete all my social medias, destroy my devices, and leave. 

They would never fucking find me and I’d be happy away from this toxic family. They only care about the best children. I’m no matter to them. And no, it’s not just one little thing that pushed me over the edge. It’s a million problems like this one, that I never get to rant about, to talk about with anyone. I get shut up or corrected If I express my feelings AT ALL here. I can’t even talk to my own Dad because he doesn’t understand, and he’s always drunk when I call him. Every few months I have a complete meltdown just exploding with things that I’ve bottled up as time goes on. Jason checks on me as a pity thing. I always tell him the same thing, that I can’t talk to him or mom about anything because they just shrug It off and never help me. He always give me a fake hug and a pat on the back, tells me he’ll work on being better and leaves me to my crying. That’s It. That’s all that happens.

 He never has worked On being better, just on ganging up on me when It’s me against his son. I asked to go to a psychologist, but mom wants me to try natural things first. The bitch just wants me to suffer, she doesn’t wanna have to take care of me and my feelings, and she sure as hell doesn’t want to pay a stranger to help me either. Dad is an alcoholic, and my stepdad Is slowly becoming one too. Takes a swig of fireball In the morning, then goes to the garage to smoke some before work. He comes home and Immediately grabs his fireball out of the freezer and goes outside for a cigarette. He comes back In, makes himself a drink, always Caribbean rum and Pepsi. He sits down to, “watch the news” while he scrolls through Facebook and doesn’t let anyone change the channel, while he looks at his phone the whole time. 

He then goes into the garage, which is moms signal to follow him, and they smoke weed for about 30 minutes or so, together. He never smokes without her, he’s the one who got her hooked on the stuff when they met. They do this 2-3 times throughout the night, each time lasting a while, so they’re stoned by the time they tuck my little brothers In for the night. My dad sits down and makes himself another Rum &amp; coke, sometimes another If he’s up late enough, takes maybe 3 more cigarette breaks.

 I’m so done with this family, so done. As I write this, I'm sitting In my room crying about today's mishap and how I'm always In the wrong, no matter what I do, and how I will always be a disappointment. My parents don't know I feel this way at all because they have never once listened to me. They'd be shocked If they read this. They think I'm happy. I don't even want kids of my own someday, just In case I turn out like them.

And just to be clear it not a money issue because he won't got to a doctor either. Like his dick could be turning green and one eye hanging out the socket and he'd just be fucking wrapping that shit up in paper towels and duct tape. (Legit seem him do that after he got injured at work.)

I am Indian who is born and raised in Mumbai. My father (57M) is this rigid and stubborn man with beliefs of his own. Growing up, he used to beat my (29M) brother because of his wrongdoings and sometimes even my mother (51F) when she challenged his beliefs. 

This resulted in my brother being a rebel drug abuser damaging his overall personality traits and my mother landed up having a secret affair (which is a whole different story)

Eventually, after seeing all this my father realised his beliefs and methods of raising a kid were wrong and was a completely opposite father when he raised me. However, his past haunted him and he went into this downward spiral of guilt, shame, and also some suicidal tendencies. This depression made him incapable to work and earn money for the family. He retired many years ago and is just functionally impaired to work. 

My brother cause of issues of his own doesn't earn that much. He is employed but he hardly ever has enough saved and barely makes through his personal expenses. 

My mother watching all this had to step forward and be the courageous person to start earning for the family.  I grew up looking at this whole transition and it naturally made me this calm, mature personality who volunteered to help as much as I could without being a burden to any of them. 

In between the process of being the sounding board of my family and absorbing everyone’s trauma I got close (became best of friends) with my mom. Watching her work hard for all of us just made me so motivated to do something for my future and I ultimately, with her support managed to get my degree in Clinical Psychology from Columbia University. Now, I have a stable job to sustain myself and almost finished paying my student loans. 

Present - My parents are old now. Father is retired, brother trying hard to stand on his two feet and mother (mildly depressed) almost looking to retire. This will eventually reach a stage where they won't have any income to survive day-to-day. She recently told me that once she retires, the baton to look after my family would come to me. 
I work as a Research Assistant Scientist but barely make minimum to survive. I am 24yo female, living alone in NYC and just helpless. I don't know how to help my family. I send all the money I save back home but I also know that I would need savings of my own to survive.

I am currently 12 years old, and my parents got divorced when i was 4, I was born in Budapest, Hungary, And my mom is Hungarian. My Father never had a good relationship with my mom while i was growing up. And in the summer of 2018 my dad decided that just me, him, and my stepmother should all move to California where my dad is from, 5-7 months before we moved he was always telling me about it and asking me questions about moving, and all of those questions made me focus on the moving all summer long and leaving my Mom behind. I sometimes cried myself to sleep some nights because i was so paranoid about how life was going to be without my mom. And then the Moving day came...



It was a hot Saturday afternoon and i woke up and just felt an aching pain of nervousness in my stomach, and that pain went on all day long and every 10 minutes i would have a short mental breakdown where i would just place my head on my desk and cry my eyes out. I got a call from my Grandmother who said she wanted to come over to my house to say goodbye to me, and i gladly accepted. My Grandmother arrived and talked to me and my mom for 1 hour. And then i heard it. My phone started ringing and i saw that my dad was calling, so i pick up the phone and hear him enthusiastically say “I’m downstairs! Ready when you are.” And i tell him i will be down in a minute and that i will say goodbye to my mom and grandmother first. I hang up the phone and tell my Grandma and Mom i have to go and we all start crying and repeating our goodbyes. And thats when I step out the door... 



When i closed that door behind me i noticed how emotional life is and how fast it goes by, i had never thought of it like that. I opened the passenger door to my Fathers car and we drove off in what felt like lightspeed. On our way down the road my moms house was on i tilted my head against the window and shed a few tears while we passed some of the stores and restaurants i had known all of my life, and thought that i wouldn’t see them for a while. (7 months pass) now im 12 years old and its getting close to the end of the school year in my first school ever in the US. I have made some really good friends and there is a girl who i like a lot. And a couple months ago my Dad announces that we will be moving to a small town in Florida this summer, and i just lose it. After all i went through to move across the globe and adjust to life here so well and make friends, and im finally happy here even though i miss my mom and can only talk to her on the phone, i still love my friends in California that have only known me for a year. I am Currently really mad and scared and sad and feeling 1 Billion different emotions at the same time. I have talked to my Father and Grandmother(who is my American Grandmother/my fathers mother who i have a close relationship with) about seeing a psychologist so i can talk to someone comfortably, and i like the idea of that a lot. Even if i share my feelings with the psychologist, I despise the idea of moving to Florida and want to convince my dad to stay in California and i dont know how to do that. Please tell me how i should convince him.

-Thank you for answers in advance

(7 months pass) now im 12 years old and its getting close to the end of the school year in my first school ever in the US. I have made some really good friends and there is a girl who i like a lot. And a couple months ago my Dad announces that we will be moving to a small town in Florida this summer, and i just lose it. After all i went through to move across the globe and adjust to life here so well and make friends, and im finally happy here even though i miss my mom and can only talk to her on the phone, i still love my friends in California that have only known me for a year. I am Currently really mad and scared and sad and feeling 1 Billion different emotions at the same time. I have talked to my Father and Grandmother(who is my American Grandmother/my fathers mother who i have a close relationship with) about seeing a psychologist so i can talk to someone comfortably, and i like the idea of that a lot. Even if i share my feelings with the psychologist, I despise the idea of moving to Florida and want to convince my dad to stay in California and i dont know how to do that. Please tell me how i should convince him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Thank you for answers in advance&lt;/p&gt;

1) I was the first birth in the family in 15 years. None of my grandparents’ kids had children, and it seems like I was born out of the blue. Why finally choose to have a kid after this long of a time?My mom was 30, my dad was 36. That’s the start of being middle-aged, so it’s not like this was having your first kid in your early 20s. This isn’t a big point, but it’s one worth noting. 

2) My dad has been in the Navy since 1986. When I was born, he was in the navy, but not active duty. He knew he would be going on active duty soon, meaning he would have no time to raise a child

3) My dad and my mom + rest of family had poor relations. My parents divorced when I was 2, and my dad went off on active duty. No one really liked him, and the fact my parents got divorced so early in my life must’ve meant relations soured. Why would you have a kid if you didn’t like each other enough?

4) My mom was $80K in debt when I was born. After my dad left, she could barely afford to make a living with her job at Walmart counting money at night. This meant she slept during the day and never really spent time with me. I was with my grandma more than my mom because of this, until I was 5 and my mom declared bankruptcy, as well as lost her job. Why would you have a kid if you’re in this bad of a financial situation?

5) My mom put her interests before mine, generally speaking. After the bankruptcy, we moved into a neighborhood with no other kids for me to play with because my mom wanted “peace and quiet for once.” We barely ever did anything, and she would send me to summer camps to get me out of the house. Due to not being able to actively meet with other kids like I did before we had to move, I developed into a super introverted and lonely person.

6) My dad remarried and helped raise another woman’s kid. Yep, even though he was still on active duty, he remarried and helped raise the woman’s kid all the way through college. At least he kept paying child support and I continued to have my insurance through his military insurance.

7) No one had money to help my pay for college. Ok, maybe not everyone gets help to pay for college, but I’m still adding this as a point. My mom had never saved up anything to help me pay. Of course I understand this somewhat because of her debt, the bankruptcy, and the unemployment. But my dad on the other hand, said he had $20k to help me pay for college. Guess what he did with it? Used it to help pay off my stepmom’s kid’s final year of college and expected him to pay it back. Guess what didn’t happen? He didn’t need that money, he made that much over the summers.

8) My dad once told me, “you were almost born in 1995.” That was pretty cryptic, but I never pushed anymore on his statement. Did my parents have an accidental pregnancy in 1995 and had an abortion? Or possibly there was a miscarriage? I’ve never heard anything else of this. 

Clearly my dad doesn’t love me. He claims he does, but he makes no effort to come see me. He doesn’t even want to move back anywhere nearby when he retires next year. He has had a minimal role in my life. My mom at least loved me enough to raise me best she could. But financially speaking, and the way relations were among my parents and family, I seem to have been born at a very bad time. I feel like I may have been more of a burden on my mom. However, I wasn’t aborted nor put up for adoption. Maybe my mom decided to stick it through and raise me.

But anyways, the evidence is there. No one has ever told me I was an accident, or made any hint of it. I’m simply putting together the pieces. I want to know for sure if I was one or not, but I don’t know any good way to ask my family about that.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A friend brought it up and I’m starting to legitimately believe it now that I look at the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

Listen to my aching heart. Listen to your aching heart. Don’t they sound the same?

I have seen this before…this pain. 

You feel helpless now that your voice isn’t reaching the people you love the most, you’re always overthinking, and much more. For so long, you watched your parents fight and disagree on almost everything. The pain you are feeling right now will soon go away, in time.

I know, I’ve been there. 

I know exactly how you feel...

just know, you didn’t cause this, and you will get through this.

Sitting in a small classroom, my teacher talked about how some parents get divorced. I remember very clearly that he was trying to help another kid going through what I was about to. I thought my family was perfect because other kids’ hands went up specifying that they too went through this, and I didn’t raise my hand. Only a week later, everything opened like a book. Although I can barely remember my parents together, and If I do remember, it’s never the best memories. But I do have wonderful memories being with them when one of the two parents are out of the picture. 

For some people, another adult and their kids come into the picture. You might not want them around, and that is understandable. Don’t be discouraged by what you’re feeling, it's normal; and you might even want your family to be whole again. And that’s okay, even if they try to tell you differently.

Soon after my dad got re-married, they fought even worse than in his first marriage. Some fights broke out into fist fights. Other times It would cause my dad to leave for a few hours at a time. And soon they got a divorce. 

I understand what you’re going through. You feel depressed, helpless, weak, small, and out of place. Thinking it’s all your fault…

...BUT IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT! 

It’s not, you weren’t the cause of this.

Soon you will overcome all your worries. You will have a much bigger family, and you will be more loved than ever before. 

Lucky you! 

Bigger holidays. Spoiled rotten on your birthday. 

You had what feels like 1000 bad days, and now you aren’t scared anymore. You have fought conquered the tough times. You are stronger than ever before. It’s okay with what your feeling now: helpless, scared, sad. Even depressed. *But it will all go away, and soon. You will be triumphant.*

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I know I can&amp;#39;t control someone else&amp;#39;s decisions but it is just tragic that she is even considering this. I try don&amp;#39;t want her to regret it later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I am watching one of the most precious pieces of famous artwork being defaced and I can&amp;#39;t control it. I&amp;#39;m sitting here helplessly as some vandal pours black paint over the Mona Lisa basically. &lt;/p&gt;

Since she was in recovery, we only went to visit her 3 days before the end of our vacation. During our visit, she didn't remember me or my sister and she thought my mom was my aunt/her sister :) She hadn't remembered us the last time we had went back to Lebanon which was in 2012 so we weren't surprise when she didn't remember us this time either. 

&amp;#x200B;

This time though, I realized maybe if I show her pictures of my sister and I as kids she might remember us. So I did just that, i pulled up some pictures on my phone and showed them to her. She used to live in the city about 15 years ago which is when she moved back to the village so the last time we really saw her was when i was 4 and my sister was 2. The second she saw the pictures, she went off saying how  those are her ""lovely little grandchildren"" and told us stories about them. Not wanting to burst her bubble, we waited a bit and then told her that we are those two girls in the pictures. She didn't quite grasp what we meant and thought we were saying we were their friends but then a few minutes passed and she looks at my sister and I and calls us by our names, which we hadn't mentioned!! 

&amp;#x200B;

Immediately my sister and I got emotional. My sister doesn't have any vivid memories with her so she wasn't as affected but it hit me so hard. I was so glad she remembered me and She was telling me how I have grown to become such a beautiful young woman and stuff and basically telling me everything I didn't expect to hear since I did not expect her to remember me. The moment only really lasted about 5 minutes after which she continued to refer to us as the neighbours kids (cuz she is close with the neighbours I guess, I'm not too sure). 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, 5 days after our visit, which by that time we were already back in Canada, we get news that she had passed in her sleep from a heart attack :( It was very sad news but I think my whole family and I were really happy we were able to get a chance to have a nice moment with her before her passing. My mom believes it was God's plan to have things end up this way; that she was able to remember us because God knew it would be her last chance. I'm not religious per say but it was truly out of this world to have such a thing happen to me.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: When visiting my great-grandmother who suffers from Alzheimer's for the first time in over 6 years, she didn't remember me or my sister until she was shown  some childhood pictures of ours. Unfortunately about a week after we visited her, she passed away. It means so much to know she remembered us, even if it was for 5 minutes, before she passed and we were able to tell her sweet words and bond with her. :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last summer, I was visiting Lebanon with my family for the second time since we immigrated to Canada in 2009 and my great grandmother who lives in my mom&amp;#39;s hometown/village had just recently had a big fall and broken both her knee and hip on her right side so she was bedridden and couldn&amp;#39;t come to the city where we were staying to visit us.

She is graduating from highschool and going to a pretty nice four year college. I am also graduating the police academy in June. I have always kind of felt like my sister was the most important in my family. 

I have 3 siblings (1 sister, 1 brother and 1 sister; all younger). “J” has always seemed like she is the most important person to my family. No matter what i do, whatever “J” does is more important. She gets away with a lot more and she gets to do whatever she wants. I realize I am the oldest so I get looked at a lot stricter by my parents, but I think they’re acting a little ridiculous with my sister. Here’s some examples of the overshadowing I’ve felt: 

1) I was having severe pain from my wisdom teeth. They all were impacted and I needed them out immediately. “J” ended up tearing her ACL that same weekend and needed surgery. I totally understand that her surgery is more important, therefore I must suffer a little longer. My family proceeds to smother “J” for a year and talk about her injury as if she had almost died. It becomes a little excessive (Facebook posts weekly, family updates on her physical therapy, blah blah). All this is happening while I am working my butt off to get into the police academy, my dream. 

2) I finally get into the police academy and this is huge for me. “J” is going through the college application process, something that I opted out of because I knew i wanted to become an officer. I still went to community college however. While I’m excited about my first day at the academy, my family doesn’t even ask how I’m feeling. All they can talk about are college tours, different colleges and what “J” wants to major in. At family parties, none of my family wants to talk about me being a police recruit. They only want to talk about “J” and her college process. 

3) My mom wants to throw a graduation party for me when I graduate the police academy. This is also around the same time “J” graduates highschool. She told us she is going to combine the parties. “J” tells my mom we can have a combined invitation and then an invitation with just “J” on it. “J” asks me to invite my boyfriends family because she wants them to give her money. I think this is selfish, but i don’t say anything to her. My dad suggests we invite one of his friends that neither “J” nor I know. I say out loud “I don’t know that person”. “J” looks at me and says “well no one is coming to the party for you anyway.” This made me upset and I went to bed. 

These are just a few examples. There are plenty of little things that make her the favorite in the family (the other siblings agree “J” is the favorite). I’m probably being really stupid and dramatic for no reason. I just feel a lot of resentment towards her. If I mention it to anyone in the family, I get laughed at, ignored or yelled at.  I can’t wait for “J” to leave for college because I really don’t want to see her for a very long time. I’ll hopefully be moving out of my parents house by the end of the year, but I’m struggling dealing with these emotions. I’m doing really well in life and I don’t feel like anyone really cares. Am I being dramatic? How can I stop feeling this way?

Earlier I went to see my family downstairs (I spend a lot of time on my own in my room, conversation wears me out) cause they were all laughing having fun the usual. My Sister spends all of her time when she isn't at work on games on her laptop or phone or whatever. I'm not much different I watch a lot of TV shows but I'm unemployed so actually my laptop time is almost constantly just applying for jobs. 

&amp;#x200B;

So there she was with the table that's so high up nobody can sit on the sofa next to her and see the TV, forcing my Mum to sit on an uncomfortable chair at the other side of the room, and if I come down, I just sit there and have to watch her laptop screen or try and look around it somehow. Easily solved by switching places but she's only once offered. It's like she has no brain or something. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd finished eating dinner and honestly was pretty ready to go back upstairs. Interaction can be quite exhausting being an introvert and I'm also going through a depressive episode lately so it's hard to smile. Sometimes I get angry cause my Sister seems not to care to even fake smile. It's great and all that she doesn't lie about her feelings but I try so hard keeping up this happy go lucky pretence that when somebody doesn't care to try and care how it affects our parents when we are down, it kinda pisses me off. We were on a sort of holiday over Easter and the girl spent all her time away from everyone, which me of all people would understand if the holiday wasn't basically a party for her since our Grandparents and Auntie couldn't come to her party the previous week. They put banners up, the seats outside in the sun, cold drinks, BBQ etc... and she was outside for the least amount of time out of everyone. But I guess you can't bring your laptop outside, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Tonight I'd decided to stay down and watch the program with my family cause my Mom had said how happy she was feeling and was smiling loads. My Mom doesn't do much of that. She's the main source of income since my Dad has limited mobility and can't do most jobs, so she works long hours and stresses a lot. She's also suffered with depression most of her life and I barely see her smile, although she tries, and I can see alot of myself in her- the whole trying to make everybody feel better by making ourselves look fine kinda thing. I relate and therefore see through it. But she was happy. So I stayed. Then, not long after, my Sister goes to bed, with the love of her life, the laptop. Straight away I see my Mum disheartened, and I just felt like punching my Sister, for the first time in a long time. My Mum thinks she has some sort of undiagnosed Autism, so I let a lot slide- like when she doesn't listen to a word anybody says if it's not a topic of conversation she's interested in, but when it is, she'll talk for ages and not realise and/or care that nobody knows what she is talking about. I have to constantly feign interest in the latest thing she's going on about, but as soon as it's somebody elses turn, fuck them, it's not interesting for her.

&amp;#x200B;

But undiagnosed condition or not, she knew. She knew my Mum was all happy because we were all together but left anyway because she doesn't care about peoples feelings. Sometimes she does though, so I just don't know what to make of her. The other day she came downstairs crying cause she was feeling lonely in general, and I ended up going off upstairs having a panic attack because I felt so sad for her. I felt sad for my Mum, my Dad, myself. I feel like depression is tearing this family up 'cause we all seem to have it, albeit in different ways and for different reasons, but I wanted to help make it go away like a big sister does. (She's 21 I'm almost 23). The next day she wanted to check up on me and told my Mum to tell me she was fine, cause she knew I was worried about her too which added to the panic attack I'd had (although I'd also tried to overdose the night before but made myself vomit it back up, and keeping that secret added to it). So I know she cares, and loves us- in her own way. But she just seems to be just fine with letting people down too. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I knew if she was intentionally like this. She's a smart girl, she knows how to make me or my family feel like crap and she does it if she wants to. She doesn't show much empathy which is why I think there might be a psychological reason for her behaviour. She seems mostly consumed in her own issues and I'm always there to try and make her feel better, but that rarely works the other way round.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I just needed a rant. Gotta accept her the way she is. Sometimes I even envy her ability to tell everybody her problems or feelings (only if they're bad, she keeps the positive ones to herself because we wouldn't want positivity now, would we?!) Sorry for my sarcasm. I envy her lack of empathy or ability to not realise or ignore when others are down too, because empathy is a huge problem for me, I'm constantly feeling sad for people I don't even know and it really adds to my depression. I'm seeing a psychiatrist this week maybe I'll talk all of this through with her too.

&amp;#x200B;

Then my dad told me and my other brother to call him and to let him know that what he is doing is wrong and to tell everything he told us to him. So my other brother gave him a call and asked him why he didn't pick up his phone when dad called and to let him know that dad was thinking you were all too good now because you got that 6 figure job and didn't care about the family. My brother from up north said that wasn't the case and he had a conversation with dad a few days ago, and dad thinking like that is very stupid. My brother from up north took it very personal and was offended by what our dad thought about the whole situation.  (I have no idea why my other brother brought up about him getting that 6 figure job because it wasn't what dad told us, but none the less, I think he unintentionally and unknowingly created strive between our dad and my brother from up north)

&amp;#x200B;

My brother from up north calls me and tells me what my other brother told him and that what dad said is very stupid. I told him that, that's how dad is and you should know by now, he is very up tight about holidays and phone calls on holidays. I told him what dad told us to tell him, but very subtly and that dad has done this in the past before. I told him not to take it personal and to look at the bigger picture. Then, I told him maybe dad doesn't think you love him anymore. My brother from up north was so offended and upset it seem like everything I told him just went out the other ear. I told him to call mom and dad again, if he couldn't reach them, then I will let them know, once I get home.

&amp;#x200B;

My brother from up north was not able to call mom because the phone was on vibrate/silent. I let my mom know and I called him myself with her phone and they started talking. However, fast forward the next day, my dad approaches me and tells me that my brother from up north hasn't called or picked up his phone calls.(I was surprised and I thought for sure he would of called him last night, but apparently it not) My dad told me I had the right as his brother(despite me being younger than him) to let him know that not picking up his phone calls or calling to his family during holidays is wrong. At this point, I was pretty exhausted about the whole situation, I didn't even want to hear about it anymore or call him up to let him know what dad was thinking. It was pretty silly to me, but the strive between them was bothering me.

&amp;#x200B;

A few hours pass and I was curious about what my brother up north was doing, so I call him and for some reason decided to ask him if he had called dad. He told me no and doesn't plan on calling him because of what he heard from my other brother. He then adds his girl friend to the phone conservation, as I told him to give me a moment, then I told him not to take it personal and that he is your dad. He told me that he took it very personal, then I told him to remember what I told him yesterday and that's how dad is and he told me that just because dad is like that doesn't mean he needs to be like that. A brief pause, and I realized everything I was telling him was not getting through and I didn't know what to say at that point. He then tells me that these are great advices and that he was going to finish eating and that we can talk another time.

&amp;#x200B;

I am really confused and lost on what I should do or if I should do anything anymore. I'm thinking that it is something small and that time will heal everything. Then I realized that his girl friend will side with him regardless of the circumstances and her hearing that with him telling the whole situation to his girl friend will add more reasons on to separate him from his family more. Let's just say that his girl friend is not fond with our family and based on my other brother's experience and judgement, he believes that she is a very manipulative person. I hope that is not the case.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know, if anyone will read this, I just want some explanation or sense of comfort that everything is going to be fine and not to worry about it. Or maybe someone's take on it or point of view based on experience.

We caught her in the act immediately after she took them because we could hear the pill bottles rattling and my mom went to see what was going on. 
She was rushed to the ER where she stayed to get IV’s and tests and she has since been 51/50 since last night around 3am when there was an open bed for her at a mental hospital. 
She was diagnosed with depression about 3 months ago and she was prescribed medicine, which she said didn’t work and so she had an appointment with a psychiatrist to get her new medication and all seemed to be going okay. 
In the past she’s mentioned wanting to kill herself and she said she wasn’t being serious but my family took it serious anyways and she was getting therapy appointments as frequently as possible. Basically, what I’m trying to say is, we were doing everything we could to make her better. 
I never thought, we never thought, that she would do something like this. 
They rushed her out to the hospital and I stood in the street crying. I crumpled to all fours and sobbed. I didn’t know what was going on or what to do or what she needed or what anyone needed. Everything was so fast and wrong and incorrect and I just kept thinking about how my mom wouldn’t get her nice Easter dinner she was so excited for and how my dad had shoved his fingers down my sisters throat to induce vomiting. 
I then ran inside and cried into her clothes. I just held a pile of her things and cried. I was angry, scared, kind of grossed out, sad, but mostly heartbroken. 
I decided that while my parents were away I couldn’t just sit around crying so I put all of the medications and sharp objects we own into bags and hid the bags. I didn’t know when she would be coming home but I did know I didn’t want this to happen again. 
I then got picked up by my boyfriends parents who I love dearly, and they helped me by basically letting me sob on their couch because I just needed to be out of that house and breathe different air and not be alone. 
It didn’t even feel like Easter anymore. 
My parents and a psychologist talked to her and all that once her vitals were confirmed as stable and she said that she had been writing suicide letters for a while now, to help her get her feelings out. And that she felt like a burden on the family and wanted to remove herself from it. 
She’s in a mental hospital now, getting the help she needs but I dont know what to do. 
I don’t feel like I can just carry on with normal life right now. It’s only been less than 24hrs right now, so I guess I’m still processing. I’m in college (I still live at home though) but I’m not going to any classes today. 
I dont know what to feel or what not to feel. I dont know anything right now, except that I’m hurt and drained. 
My whole face feels swollen from crying and I know I’ll cry again and again today and probably until she is released. I’m trying to distract myself. 
Today, we can visit her after 4pm. But I don’t know if I want to. I’m scared and angry and I don’t want to see her in the hospital like that. I dont know what to do.
I’m sorry this post was long. thank you if you’ve read through it to this point. Idek what the point of this post is. I guess to get everything out and let out my concerns and feelings. 
This is the absolute hardest thing I’ve ever gone through. I’ve been through some evil awful stuff, but for some reason this is worse than everything combined. 
I guess advice, answers, stories, anything would be nice to hear from you all.

Background- my dad has exactly two personalities/moods. One is happy and laid back, whenever things are going his way. I can say with all my heart that he’s genuinely a good father when in these moods, very funny and doesn’t get annoyed at things easily. The other is whenever something does manage to annoy him. And while not many things fit into the category, if it fits, his attitude completely changes. This includes stuff like the house’s cleanliness. Our house is certainly not messy, but he’ll get angry if we haven’t vacuumed in a while/if a purse or coat has been hung on a chair. Another example is if I suggest maybe something in how I’m being treated isn’t fair, because I don’t do anything around the house, etc (for reference I vacuum, I bake/cook, take out the recyclables, walk the dog, and set the table)

The biggest problem is that he’s terribly stubborn. If he thinks something, he refuses to hear anything that suggests he’s wrong. He and my brother sometimes talk politics, for instance, and he’ll say something blatantly untrue, so my brother will look it up and show him he’s wrong, and he’ll go “let’s drop this”, and get really angry if anyone tells him he has a problem with not accepting facts. Important note though, he does not physically abuse us at all, angry just means verbally, potentially punishment-wise if we talk back too much (regular grounding stuff)

Anyways! The recent event I mentioned was that I had come to him to help me replace a part in my controller. I made sure to show him i was grateful, and he wasn’t reluctant to do it. During the process, one piece didn’t seem to go in far enough, and we had to put the old part back and order a new one. Meanwhile, I went on customer reviews and reddit to see what was the problem. Unanimously, the reply was “it seems to not go in enough, but in reality it does, just push it in as far as it goes”. Naturally, I brought this to my dad, since that would clearly solve our problem, but he told me he was positive it wasn’t going in as much as it should, and he knew more than my “internet friends”. I tried to reason with him, since clearly he’d be wasting his efforts trying to fix something incorrectly, but he got really mad, saying that I was calling him dumb and that if I was so sure I could fix it myself. I tried explaining that I didn’t think he was dumb or anything, i just knew this was the solution and wanted to help. Needless to say, I got the repair-supplies bag tossed pretty angrily at me, not enough to hurt, but enough to convey his annoyance. I brought up a tutorial on my phone and fixed it myself, relieved I didn’t break anything. Finally, I turned it on to test it; bingo, works perfectly. I tried showing my dad that it was indeed the solution and he told me that he didn’t appreciate being lectured and I should think about that if I ever want to ask him for help again. I tried explaining that I felt he should be a little less stubborn and not immediately dismiss others knowledge, but just got the same thing. 

How can I tell my dad he needs to be a little more flexible in his thinking without making him angry and risking punishment? Unfortunately I can’t exactly change my way of acting after these events to show how it effects me (joking with him less, or being generally more quiet) because I’m the literal worst at keeping up grudges, so when I do try to express my feelings, they just seem like me being a moody teen, and that he can just act this way whenever and I’ll still treat him the same way.

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory:

I'm from Ontario. This is where all my family lives and where I grew up. My boyfriend and I have been together for 8 years - we met in high school and he decided to go away to BC for university. He ended up loving BC so much that he wants to live out there for a couple years. I also love it and would like to try it out for a couple years and finally live together.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the problem... my parents are making me feel so much guilt for wanting to move away. They are very traditional and feel the family needs to stick together. I have my own business which luckily, I can work from out there just the same. But they are constantly making me feel bad about this decision which has led me to feel like maybe i'm being selfish for wanting to do this? My flight is today and my parents have been so quiet to me. I didn't sleep last night becuase I just feel so much guilt. They're making me feel like i'm making the wrong decision. My dad was crying and wont talk to me. My mom just yesterday said to me ""you wont even be home for mothers day? That's not very nice"". Which honestly felt like a punch in the stomach. They won't drive me to the airport becuase of how disappointed they are. For context: I'm going to be back already at the end of May.

&amp;#x200B;

I love my parents and my family and we're very close so it's not like I want to pick up and leave forever. I just want to experience this while we're young (no kids etc) and finally prioritize my relationship with my boyfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys honestly think? Am I the one being selfish here? Is this going to tear apart my family?

&amp;#x200B;

I just need to hear someone else's opinion.

Thank you in advance for any responses, I really appreciate it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

My parents are 45 each and have been married for about 20 years. My dad does not earn a lot, just enough to afford some luxuries. So, my mother started to work about 4 years ago. She goes at around 8:30 in the morning and returns by 7:30 in the evening. My dad who stays at home most of the time (he is a real estate broker) has to do some household chores. He thus cannot focus on his own work and also feels that he is losing his dignity. 

Also, my dad goes out almost every day with his friends and has a few drinks, I would not say that he parties. I guess he does this to just get the stress off his chest. 

My mother who returns around 7:30 p.m has to also take care of the household and also of her parents. This leaves her with almost no time for my father. By the time she gets free (around 9), my dad leaves with his friends and returns by 11. 

My mother does not have a lot of problem with this, but my father does.

Also, my maternal grandparents (pretty old) live in the next block, alone. I feel side for them as they have no company except for each other. I make it a point to visit them atleast once every week. So, my father suggested that they move to my mother's sister's place, who does not have a job and also financially secured kids. This, according to him would not only save my mother's time and energy but also by giving the floor on rent, my mother would not have to do her job.

She returned by 11:30 p.m. My father was furious. My mother felt really bad as there was no other option. My father did not mean to shout at my mother, but his anger overcame himself. He feels that my mother's sister should also take a fair share of her responsiblity. In his heart of hearts, he wants all of us to be happy and be a normal family who have enough time for each other.

I'm not saying this because I'm obligated to say this about my son, as his father my wife and I see and know his heart is pure and full of love. Even when his cousin is being a shit head.

Sadly in my experience growing up and now as and adult when a parent says ""not my child"" it usually is your child. 

Anyone else been in this crappy situation, how did you address this issue? How would one go about it? My son by now has forgotten about it, should I too let it go as well for the hundredth time!?

Besides all of this plus her crazy jealousy, my son still thinks she&amp;#39;s the sweetest human-being at Earth and they will get married, I don&amp;#39;t what to do, I can&amp;#39;t cut her out of my life without cutting my son and the whole reason why I want her out is mostly because of the way she is with my son, once they married, will be more than official that she&amp;#39;s a part of my family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ldr; My son is engaged to and have a baby with an over-jealous girl who tries to make him less confident, is controlling, have him paying her bills and openly thinks that she&amp;#39;s a better mother than I was besides having conditions I didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

First post and I'm a bit nervous.

I'm a 23 year old dude from the US.

Most of my family was born in Puerto Rico and the rest were born in the states. I'm part of the first generation Latino Americans in my family. My brother was first born and spoiled to the core. He was given anything you could ask for, faced no consequence for his actions, and things like that. If he didn't get his way, he'd throw a fit. So I was subjected to eating so many of the same foods at home, when we went to dinner, when we got groceries. And if I didn't make him food or fetch something when he asked for it, he would beat the hell out of me.

We are in no way friends.

My mother was a whole other story.

She came from a family where she was treated like dirt (being second of four girls).

She was subjected to physical, emotional, and psychological abuse. My grandmother (who suffered from a lot of mental health issues) was convinced at one point that my mother was sleeping with my grandfather.

My grandmother hated her to the core and my grandfather did absolutely nothing to stop this. He sat on the sidelines, literally not giving a shit.

To this day, my grandparents try to milk everything out of my family. This includes my aunts, my uncle by marriage, my father's family, extended family friends, my mother, my brother, and even my cousins. But guess who the biggest target was?

Yours truly.

I was given the short stick when no one wanted to deal with other members of my family. Grandparents needed to do laundry and no one wanted to clear what they were doing? Call me. Mom needed someone to pick things up because she forgot but my stepdad or brother were out of reach? Call me. My brother was too lazy to go get his own food just down the street because his airhead girlfriend said no? Flags me down as I'm walking out the door.

This would all be fine if it wasn't all the fucking time. God forbid I said no when I was sick, tired, had plans, or just didn't want to deal with anyone. Nope. I had to cancel everything and go to as they asked.

My mother is the most compulsive shopper I've ever seen. She buys things on sale and keeps buying. If it's even the least bit damaged or not what she expected, she'd send it back and raise hell. She nearly tossed a basically new pair of Nike running shoes because the previous owner left them a little grey at the bottom. I luckily took them.

My brother is the most insecure and disrespectful piece of shit I've ever dealt with. If any woman raises her voice at him during an argument, he would scream his head off and throw things until they got quiet. This included my mother, who would just yell right back at him.

I'll spare you the details about his girlfriend. She's just... so damn stupid. I lose brain cells just thinking of her logic for things.

Onto my wife...

Her family is originally from Finland. But she was moved to Norway when she was young for a better life.

She never knew her real father.

Her sister is a spoiled brat who thinks she can do as she pleases. My mother in law does not reprimand or yell at her, tell her to change when she's dressed inappropriately, or set limits when it comes to taking food or drinks in the house. My sister in law doesn't cook, clean, have a job, or do anything to contribute to the house.

My mother in law takes digs at my wife all the time. What she says, what she wears, what she does, how she spends money. While my mother in law does the exact same things or worse.

My wife and I met over the Internet.

We had instant chemistry and got very close. My mother immediately had issues with her, seeing as she wasn't a normal woman in my mother's eyes.

I had fallen very ill late last year and my mother took full initiative to care for me. But once I was in recovery, she and my brother were quick to say that I needed to start doing things around the house again and start trying to find work to pay bills. I was weak from being in a bed for a MONTH, barely able to walk far, or keep down much in terms of food. Even after the first month of recovery, I was still in bad shape.

My wife (then girlfriend) knew I was in a bad mood that night and did all she could to get me to open up. I blurted out everything and freaked out, hitting things until my right hand was messed up.

We got a lot closer after that.

One day, I hopped on a flight out of JFK and made the long flight to be with my now wife. Her mother is thrilled to see that I'm real and want to take care of my wife. She's gladly accepted me into the family.

My mother wasn't as nice...

My mother assumes that I was forced into doing everything. Moving here, getting married, and a bunch of other shit. If I even say one word out of place, my mom goes off on how I should do things voluntarily and not because I felt I had to.

This defies all the logic she told me when I was growing up. She basically did what she was saying my wife is currently doing.

All my mother and I seem to do is fight. She's even more upset that I want to stay in Norway with my wife and not return back to her house.

My mother didn't know that I barely had food at home and she nor my brother wanted to help me in that department, I didn't shower or wash clothes because the water bill was high due to my brother, I had no will to live because I was miserable and right back where I started before I got sick.

I'm close to getting residency and I want nothing to do with my mother or brother because they're straight up toxic.

Am I wrong for this? Is it bad that I want to be happy? Am I a bad son and a disgrace to the family name?

Sometimes it’s just too much. The weight I´m carrying. I know the universe isn´t supposed to be fair, but I do wish it were.

And I know that compared to others my package is nothing. But everything is relative, so here we go.

I just want to get this out there to talk to someone.

I grew up in a religious family: my parents are traditional and rather strict from an Arab background. We later moved/ emigrated to the West. So, my family is center right, religious, traditional. I myself am very left, not religious at all and rather modern.

I don´t know how and when things started to change but it is so odd to call home now. I have nothing to share with my family. I feel so disconnected to them. My mom always talks about God on the phone and I just say yes and move on.

My dad is bipolar. I don´t think I have a single memory of him being in a stable phase.

It´s mostly downs for him, though I remember a few ups. He would get angry and violent at times, at my mom mostly.

He has changed somewhat. He is depressed now, since about five years.

There is something to be said about seeing your dad lay for days on end on the bed and do nothing but sleep. It´s soul crushing.

He has been taking a lot of medication for quite a while now. And I truly believe that the maniac/ depressed episodes &amp; the medication are having their toll on him. He barely understands what is being said and even if he is at the table and people speak about him, he would not understand if people don´t use his name.

My mom finished school at grade 9 and not more. I recently had to explain to her how to copy something on her phone and while doing so she said” but where is it gone to? I can’t see it anymore”.

Because we moved countries and because of difficult country regulations my parents speak the language here very poorly. My siblings and I became parents to our own parents from an early age on and I still regularly have to translate things and send messages of sentences that my parents read aloud at the doctors etc. to get their needs heard.

It´s not that my parents were not loving or well trying to do their best. I am not very sure what, but something was lacking because me and my siblings would describe our family as dysfunctional.

And additionally, to that my family is rather poor. My parents don´t work much and spend their days at home watching TV.

And because of my family upbringing I have this weird relationship to relationships and sex (the idea was until marriage).

So now I am in my mid-20s. Never had a boyfriend. Just recently started dating, making out and having sex, but it wasn´t even pleasurable for me. It´s not that I don´t want sex, it´s that my body doesn´t get aroused.

I moved for grad school and am quite lonely in this new place and suddenly things are showing up for me.

I am also currently surrounded by people who have loving/ rich/ smart/ privileged families and I think seeing what it could have been like just drags me down further .... Or realizing what it would have meant to have parents you can rely on to help you, parents you can discuss things with other than god, parent´s you weren´t ashamed of ...

I have been dealing quite well but recently it´s all just become too much.

I guess it’s time to deal with my package.

I realize that I am slowly drifting into depression and I am just scared that I am bipolar too.

I am scared that I am asexual.

And I am just lonely and scared of being so in the future. And lonely in the platonic as well as romantic sense.

This all might sound like I´m dealing somehow but I have cried myself to sleep so many times and it doesn´t seem to be getting better.

These are all items that we would have liked to keep in the family, and we don’t understand why he would possibly give them away to random people. Whenever we personally approached him about taking on some of the heirlooms in the past he would refuse, so asking him outright doesn’t work. 

Does anyone have any experience with this kind of thing? What should we do? I don’t want to be too forceful or give the wrong message, nothing would make me happier than to see him live for many years more.

Whenever we personally approached him about taking on some of the heirlooms in the past he would refuse, so asking him outright doesn’t work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any experience with this kind of thing? What should we do? I don’t want to be too forceful or give the wrong message, nothing would make me happier than to see him live for many years more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR My grandfather has been giving away his family heirlooms to random neighbors even though he turned his entire life around to see his grandchildren grow up.&lt;/p&gt;

Read below and let me know if there’s any way I can make her life better &amp;amp;amp;amp; her happier, somehow. 

6 or 7 years ago my mom got a phone call that seemed to be a butt dial...from my dad’s secretary. To make a long story short, he had been cheating on my mom for years. He had a family with his secretary (three younger kids), while he had a family with my mom (three older kids). The next three years were horrible. Mom was depressed, taking anti depressants. Eventually they got divorced. 

It still affects us to this day, financially...because again long story, but basically my dad borrowed from my mom’s family long ago to start his several businesses. One of those loans was around 300,000. And it all went to shit because he lost the business. 

Anyway, my dad eventually just stopped paying for everything: the house, the cars, our phones, all bills, everything. My siblings and I are in college (he never helped us out), but now that we need his financial support more than ever we don’t have it. His other family does. 

As for my mom, she had studied to be a doctor but when she had us, my dad had encouraged her to stay home and take care of us and so she did. So when this affair was discovered, my mom had to get a job somewhere &amp;amp;amp;amp; now she makes about $15/hr. But that’s not enough to pay the bills / all the family loans she has now. Besides the huge one mentioned above, she’s had to borrow from family almost every other month to pay for the house, the car, everything. So the debt just keeps building. Oh and also my mom just recently took him to court to fight previous child support stuff (she never did this before because they were on okay terms I guess...until something happened and she decided enough was enough). But nothing came out of that year long process except the judge giving my mom a form saying she should hire a lawyer to get $$ from my dad for the stuff mentioned in the divorce papers (house car phone bills). But again the issue is my mom has no money. My dad, as you can probably tell, is a liar. My mom thought house payments were going good but in reality, he wasn’t paying. So now the house is worth near nothing. Selling it would be no good. 

So now my mom’s gonna have to rent the house for good (she’s been airbnbing it while living in for a few months). 
But now she’s actually gonna rent it. That’s good because there will be a surplus of maybe $1000 a month.  But then now she has to live in her mom’s house, which is quite a distance away from where she works. And her mom has memory issues ..forgets everything so basically in moving in my mom will have to be her caretaker. 

And my mom’s love life isn’t great. The guy she started dating straight up told her “I don’t love you and I’m not looking for a relationship. I just want company.” 

Basically, for the last 6/7 years my mom’s life has been absolute shit. All she does is stress and cry over $ burdens. My brother and sister no longer have a relationship with my dad (as of this December). 

I just can’t take this anymore. I can’t take my mom’s sadness and stress, in that I feel so horrible that I can’t help her. I graduate college  next year so maybe then I can start to help my mom and move her into another home (while paying off my own school loans). 

I just need help. There’s no one I can ask. What do I do? Please just anything. I want nothing more than my mom to be happy. Since I was 15 years old my only wish on 11:11 has been for my mom to win the lottery so she could pay off the debts she has. I forgot to mention, that huge debt has caused so many conflicts amongst her and her sisters. 

My dad’s actions have essentially ruined my mom’s life. And he doesn’t give a crap.

&lt;p&gt;The advice I&amp;#39;m looking for is just how to cope with this and if it&amp;#39;s normal. At the end of the day she really likes me, and she&amp;#39;s just confused. She thinks that by letting me in she&amp;#39;s betraying her dad and I don&amp;#39;t know how to make her not feel this way. It isn&amp;#39;t any easier when her dad refuses to communicate at all. He ignores my fiance&amp;#39;s text and calls. She really cares about communicating so co-parenting is easier and he won&amp;#39;t do that. It&amp;#39;s really stressing my fiance out because she doesn&amp;#39;t want to make her daughter resent her. So any advice helps even if it&amp;#39;s down to &amp;quot;give it time&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Due to a lack of job prospects in my home country I had to emigrate and now I live in a country that is not my own, it is neither an English speaking country, meaning I have to conduct all daily interactions in a second foreign language, which I had to learn and is still far from perfect, a daily problem. Back in the home country, my father is a successful professor and owns real estate. He is financially well off.

My father is the kind of person that always knows best. He programmed my life. With this I mean he “suggested” what religion I had to believe and what I had to study (because people without an university degree don’t get decent jobs). Being 18 years old I was an absolute moron, an asshole with no idea of life whatsoever and way too immature to verbally confront him. I simply finished high school and didn’t know what to do next, but what he “suggested”.

So I started a double bachelor in law and economics with all expenses paid. I grew up extremely protected, I never learned cooking at home, living with my parents I never did the laundry, I never had to cook until I left my parents house, I never had to work to be at that prestigious university, even then I never had to pay a single bill, I was simply a 19 year old child, not prepared for real life. I wasn’t sure about this bachelor, but I thought “if my father believes I can do it, well, I can. After all I got the third best note of my promotion”.

It backfired. Badly. I wasted three semesters and passed 3 subjects. Any intelligent person would by now have realized that something had to be done. Not me. It was my father. He had a conversation with me and basically told me: “if you don’t want to study this, or if it’s too much, you can stop anytime. Take the rest of the semester as a vacation and think about other bachelors to pursue. Ill cover the expenses.”

I remember I cried like a little bitch. I cried because I was a failure, a loser, a piece of shit, because I had wasted 3 semesters already, because any other student was better than me (simply because they passed).

So I went back to my childhood town and at the beginning of the next semester I told my father “I am going to study law and economics and this time I’m going to pass it”. My father acted a bit surprised, but financed me.

Yes, I failed again. This time I lasted one semester. Yes, I was this level of asshole. What now strucks me is: I went into the class with the attitude of an arrogant asshole: I actively avoided all social interactions, I never replied when talked to, some girls that surely sensed something was off with me tried to talk to me, but I simply ignored them. I even ignored a very pretty girl that showed romantic interest in me. Because I was depressed, because I was a failure, but at the same time I felt superior to all those losers below me (because they were younger). I was now 21 years of age.

I always wanted to major in History, but my father, who always knew better told me it is a bachelor with no prospects and that I should study something else, like law or economics or both. I still had this mindset and instead of getting a job or studying history (something I enjoyed) I got accepted at a local university to study law.

Nope, it didn’t go well this time either. I studied law for 2 semesters and… I don’t even know how many subjects I passed, but not many. 22 years of age. Still no a clear path of life, still avoiding human contact. I had become a hikikomori, a basement dweller.

The next year I didn’t study anything, but simply enrolled in a local academy to learn French and German. 23 years of age. Another girl showed romantic interest in me. I ignored her. I was still antisocial.

On that October, me being 23, I decided to study history at the national open university, because I didn’t want to socialize and studying from home was a way to achieve it, and I wanted to finish a degree and a master in the shortest time and then be financially independent. My father obliged and payed the expenses.

I always enjoyed history and this time I made it. Bachelor of History in 3 years and Master of Contemporary History 2 years later. Plus knowledge of foreign languages and some finished law and economy courses. 28 years of age. From home with no social contacts, no friends and a bit jealous of all other college students with girlfriends, an enraged virgin.

I have tried to describe the situation as realistically as possible.

I blame my father because his actions, no matter how well meant, transformed me into a depressed basement dweller, but I also blame myself for not questioning him earlier, for not growing a spine, for not having the guts of getting a job and moving out. I wasted 4 years of my life and became a depressed antisocial alcoholic. For a decade I never talked to anybody out of my family. I had no friends. Now I still have very poor social skills and compared to people my age I am still very immature.

I am now 40 years old. After my Master of Contemporary History in my home country I finished a second Master of Education (only to discover I don’t like teaching or teenagers) and due to the mortgage crisis I emigrated to Germany to try to find a job with my degrees. Turns out everybody with a Master degree in Germany speaks English and the niche for Italians with a History degree is, well, there is none. Here I wasted another 4 years trying to get the recognition (Anerkennung) of my Master of Education while learning German and doing menial jobs and only a year ago I realized I was still a huge asshole, that I still don’t like teenagers and I’d hate being a high-school teacher. I still wanted to become like my father, to get a job with my degree, to earn as much as him. I’ll never earn as much as him.

I still ask regularly my father for money. It is what it is. The job I do now requires nothing more than a high school diploma and has nothing to do with what I studied and I am, well, a loser. It’s a job. I don’t hate it, don’t like it much either. My father lied to me. A degree is not a guarantee you will get a better job. I am too old to study something else, being 40 I have very poor chances in the marketplace with my degrees and the language barrier is still a problem.

I’m conflicted about what to think of my father and of myself.

I have a tendency to make very bad decisions.

On top of this, I’m an introvert.

TL;DR my father programmed my life and I was too immature to pursue my own path. I wasted 4 years of my life and became an alcoholic depressed antisocial basement dweller. I still receive money from him.

I have always tried to remain magnanimous towards him for the sake of our kids. In fact I bite my tongue regularly.

Recently, despite me asking him not to and explaining why I object, my ex has continued to take our children into his place of work.  I have asked him not to take the children to his place or work because he had a long affair (now apparently over) with his work colleague and they have no reason to meet her. 

I do not want our children being put into the situation whereby they are forced into contact with the very person who went out of their way to make my life hell for years and ultimately played a major role in the destruction of our family unit. It is extremely difficult to remain positive about their time with their father when he goes back on his promise and takes them there. Despite having assured me that he does not -and then also continues the subtext of lies.  There is zero reason why they should go into his place of work. I almost feel that this is being done out of “power” and “spite”. 

(I should add here that I know he and I both have parts to play in the breaking of our marriage)

I should make it very clear at this juncture that I view the divorce as wholly positive. It was my decision in the end to separate following years of emotional abuse and lies. Essentially giving up hope in favour of creating a secure environment of trust and encouragement for the kids and I. I was facilitating his bad behaviour. I have a new healthy relationship and the children see what commitment and partnership really is now.  However, I struggle financially and the children and I have had to make huge changes to our lives as a result. Some of which have been unwelcome and painful -moving home / spending Christmas apart etc. 

I told the children about their father’s relationship with his work colleague being part of the reason that their parents are no longer married. I told them the bones of how this woman was very very spiteful to me and hated me because she wanted their daddy to be her boyfriend. I now feel so bad for doing this. The kids took it in their stride and asked reasonable questions -some of which I fielded by explaining that one day they would be able to know everything when they were old enough. I assured them that this was not their fault, that if daddy took them to his work that they should not feel bad but they needed to understand why I might be upset about it. They know that they should be polite to her and we talked about what they might say if she spoke to them -which was “no thank you” etc -that they just needed to know who she was and why I do not like her. 

Why did I do it? 
1) I don’t feel that they should be encouraged to form a relationship with this person when one day they will learn that this person did everything in their power to break their family and succeeded. 
2) this person was spiteful to me over a long period of time and ergo I do not trust them around my children -she hit their father on at least one occasion.   Naturally, I want to protect them from her spite. 
3) I want to prevent the kids from being exposed to lies and manipulation. 
4) my ex does not need to take the children there and I think he does it to “flex his muscles”. 

My ex and I have a good relationship now (all things considered) but I really feel he is taking the biscuit here.

A quick little background note, my mom passed away in 2004 and my dad passed away in 2014. 

I recently did one of the ancestry DNA tests to find out my about my family history. I got my results back on Monday. the website shows you family members on both sides of your family. I had noticed people from my mother's side, but no one from my dad's side. 
I was pretty confused so I asked my two older sisters if they recognized anyone. (sisters are 40 and 41 years old) at first they both said no and that it was weird. 

later that day, I got a really long message from one of my sisters telling me that my dad was not my biological father. my parents forced her to keep it a secret and not tell anyone. 
she told me that my biological father wanted to be in my life but my parents wouldn't let him. 

my parents were married for like 40+ years so my mother was still married to my dad when she cheated on him and got pregnant with me. my parents would be in their 60s if they were still alive today. my biological father is 62. 

it's so hard for me to believe this. my dad was one of my best friends in my life as I didn't have the best relationship with my mother. I had zero idea that my dad wasn't my biological father my entire life. I even have curly hair and blue eyes like him. this all feels so fake or like some kind of joke. 

looking back, there are a few things that happen which does make sense now. my favorite book growing up was ""are you my mother"" by dr Seuss. I looked at my dad ask said ""are you my father"" and he got really upset. I was only about 5 years old at the to me. and there are times he would just look at me and cry but not tell me why. 


I added my biological father on Facebook and he seems really happy that I found out and he seems like a nice guy but I'm starting to feel like I dont want to get to know him now and pretend this never happened. 

sorry if this is too long or messy to read. I'm just not sure how to process all of this.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;hi everyone, this is my first time posting here. &lt;/p&gt;

I don't exactly know where to start or how to explain whats in my head. I've tried writing this 3 times now... 

I'm afraid my family doesn't like me and just wants me gone like I'm some bad memory. My mother has considered me a 'failed child' since I was 9, and admitted it to my face at 14. She disowned me and kicked me out at 18 with no job experience or even how to get a job to live with an aunt who turned out to be emotionally abusive. My aunt helped me get a job on a produce farm, and then when she got let go would berate me for not cleaning the house or doing dishes when I get home from 6 to 12 hour days.

My emotions are everywhere. I'm depressed, scared, and lonely. I was convinced to quit my job *by my family* and then harassed and lectured about not finding another one right away. I've become the joke of my family and as much as it hurts I can't say anything. I want a job, I want out, but it's gotten to the point I can't even find the desire to leave my room when my dads home because it'll be another long drawn out lecture and story of HIS life. Constantly reminded of how 'lazy' 'disrespectful' and 'non courteous' I am.

Reminding me I haven't worked in a year and a half, that I had to stop paying utilities because of it. How I don't do anything around the house even though I do... How I disrespect him and that my behavior makes my brothers disrespect him. Guilt-ing me into helping with his new house with sayings like 'you have nothing better to do' or 'you don't have a job so you can come help me at the new house'. Getting upset with me when I take too long to get ready or have an off day and break down into tears to try and stand up for myself so I can BE the adult he wants me to be.

I feel like I'm responsible for everything that goes wrong. I constantly feel awful and want to do better but every time I'm starting to improve my family makes me the center of their amusement with back handed comments and jokes.

So... am I the reason my world seems to be falling apart and chasing me away? Am I what is causing my family to push me away? Am I the one destroying the relationships between me and my family members? How do I fix it? I can't help but feel if I move away they won't miss me, as much as they'll miss using me to clean house or laugh at... I want to disappear from them but they're the only family I have.

I've tried going to them for help, but I'm always scolded for 'being childish' and that I should just 'adult up'. Even my dad says I need therapy, and has admitted he doesn't know what to do with me and my mental state. I'm so lost and overwhelmed. I don't know what to do anymore... I don't see how even something as basic and necessary as a job will fix my relationship with the rest of my family...

It's to the point when the lectures start he mentions all the thing he provides me. Including food, and it makes me feel guilty for eating it or being hungry... I feel guilty for the water I drink... I'm starting to feel guilty for even being in his presence... I want out... but I'm scared that if I leave I won't matter to any of my family anymore... That I'm just a nuisance...

First of all I'm 19, so I can legally watch all the porn I want. That's not the issue.
So basically I never had a normal, healthy realtionship with my parents.

The music I listen to? Meaningless noise. Movies I watch? Senseless fighting. So I ended up keeping all my interests to myself, never sharing them with my parents and this is where I landed now.
I never shared what I do on the phone or the internet, but since the internet has a reputation for porn, even my tech illiterate dad heard about it from equally uneducated people and he seems to think that's what the internet solely consits of or something. Anyway, I was playing some relatively normal video game the other day (GTA 3), dad walked over, so I minimized the game and proceeded to stare at the blank desktop, like I've been doing for the past few years. Then he left the room, walked over again, I repeated the same thing and boom! He concluded that I must have been watching porn, since I hid whatever I was doing when he was around. (I get it, it's kind of suspicious if I refuse to show whatever I'm doing, but I could have plenty of reasons besides that.) Then he demanded to see what I was doing, which I stubbornly refused because I felt offended that I could not have any privacy or what-so-ever. Well, let's just say it ended quite a mess - he seemed to let it pass, but later began lamenting how getting me a computer and the internet was a mistake, how it ruined my life, blah blah blah. (It sounds funny, now that I think about it, but back then it just made me enraged.)
Now, this is hardly the first time this has happened. Ever since I had a feature phone with internet (when I was 12 or 13; pretty early I know) he would check my phone; then the PC time to time, but he never found anything. I let it brush off in the past, but over the last two years my relationship with them have went down the gutter, I have severe anger management issues and now I can't simply get over it. It's been a week.
I did a few things. I wiped the computer, thought to never use it again; but I'm stuck at home (school's closed) and there's not much else to do after I finish my homework and chores. I ended up setting it up again, but I've never been okay with this computer since. I can't play games at peace anymore, can't do anything, really. I keep obsessing over our past conversation and get the desire to smash the computer into pieces; but that sounds like a really bad idea. I wish I could get over it and continue my normal life instead of obsessing over this childish thing.
Any advice?

Our Mom passed away Dec 2017, my brother has always had some issues like having a temper problem and he didn't finish school for several reasons so while he is 20 years old, he still is sort of a couple years behind with learning to adult. My dad lives in the same area as him but isn't the most reliable, nurturing kind of parent. I live 12 hrs away.

So my brother had a gf and they were together for about a year and a half. They just broke up because she feels like my brother really needs to figure things out before she can continue on with a relationship. I agree. My brother isn't wise with money, he just now has his first job and he just blows his money on stupid things because he gets interested in something and then goes all out for it. And again, he has anger issues too. 

I don't know if I'm being overly concerned but I'm worried that without her in the picture he's going to spiral downward. He handled our mom's death better than I expected but his gf was a pillar for him and I'm worried he's going to become very isolated and unmotivated now and he's so difficult to reach both literally and figuratively. It'll take him 3 days to respond to a call or text so I'm like Jesus let me know you're alive and then it's hard to get him to really listen to you. He shuts people out the instant he thinks you're going to say something he doesn't want to hear so I don't know how to be there for him or how to tell of an warning signs that he is not okay.

TLDR my brother just had a breakup and he's basically all alone now 2 states away from me, his sister. Not sure how to try to be there for him or be aware of possible cries for help since he barely responds or listens when I try to talk to him.

Please no comments about him being immature and needing to grow up, I get this from people I talk to and it's the most unhelpful thing.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me preface this with some quick info. &lt;/p&gt;

I didn’t see it at first, so I told her to try not to take it personally and maybe don’t say hi next time keep it moving, focus on work Since that’s why we all are here. After a while, I did notice Stacy been treating Z weird and unfair and so the next time Z mentioned it to me I recommend that she to talk to the main Manager we going to call “Bob” 😂 or HR if she is feeling bullied. Because personally talking to me Idk if I can do anything since I am not involved. So she talks to the main manager and HR in the same room. I felt happy for her, and so the main manager and HR said they all are going to have a meeting with her and Stacy this Friday. Well, that same day Stacy called me into the office and was talking about my work ethic saying she wants me to step up and do some more work and pick up some more days so I can move up in the company with housekeeping. And I told her ""ok,"" but in my head, I thought I don’t wanna move up and be a lead or manager for housekeeping. I’m just doing this to get my CNA license and to move up and be a CNA in the hospital since I am going to school for nursing. And then she mentioned quickly not to get wrapped up in the drama here, and I said: ""I’m not, I’m just focused on my work."" So I went back to work, and I guess “Z” saw I got pulled in to the office and was panicking and I told her I got pulled not because of her. I told her ""I was pulled in just to do some more work around the hospital and that I am not involved with any drama here in the hospital."" Z started catching an attitude with me saying “She pulled you in the office because of me."" I explained to her me getting pulled into the office had nothing to do with you! After that convo, she started acting weird, and we all just went home from work. Today she sent me a message on facebook stating “I feel hurt about the situation, and I’m getting me a new locker, and I’m going to give you your space since I know she doesn’t want you around me...and I don't want to jeopardize your job.” she unfriend me on Facebook. I’m shocked but like a little upset because that meeting had nothing to do with her and I don't know how many times I have to explain that to her! I am starting to feel That Z wanted me to be involved with the situation which is not fair. Ever since that day, I told Z that I told her (Z) and Stacy that I am not involved that’s when Z started having an attitude. As if Z wanted me to tell Stacy “I’m involved and you’re wrong for how you been treating Z.” Am I wrong for telling both of them I am not involved? When I told Stacy I was not involved she did not get mad and was glad that I wasn't and kept it moving. Please Let me know what else to do I truly would appreciate your help. Thank you so much.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Everyone, In the beginning, I started this job last June 2018. I work as a housekeeper in this pediatric hospital. So, me and this coworker who we are going to call “Z” have been talking, she was really cool at work and sometimes we would talk on the phone and what not. Until this new manager who came back in mid-July close to August ( we would call her “Stacy). Stacy liked me and thought I was a real hard worker ( which I am) and always gives and a few employees from work &amp;quot;employee of the month&amp;quot; except for “Z”. So, “Z” felt some way and was a little upset about not getting employee of the month and started expressing her anger to a few other employees and me. I told her maybe you should talk to Stacy and Z keeps rejecting that advice I have given her. A few months went by Z stated that she feels Stacy does not like her and that every-time she walks by she gives Z a shady hi and what not. I didn’t see it at first, so I told her to try not to take it personally and maybe don’t say hi next time keep it moving, focus on work Since that’s why we all are here.

My brother was born only a year after their marriage and then me, my sister and my younger brother came at 3 year intervals, so we are four kids. When I was about 16, I caught my mom in bed with another woman, a woman who hanged out with my family quite often, and as it later transpired, she was my mom, and my dad’s lover (they were having a menage á trois). My parents didn’t really bother to keep their sexual life a secret and this woman was basically part of our family, spending most of her time at our house and going on trips with us. She’s really nice and after about 6 years of her being part of the family, I have come to love her as an older sister, or second mother if you will. 

My mom was never a classic mom, she never really showed her children love, never cared much to ask us about school, homework, our friends or anything for that matter. She was very absent from my and my siblings’ lives and I have always suffered from intimacy and confidence issues in my dating life due to the fact that I basically grew up without a real mom. Through conversations with my dad, I have found out that almost the whole time I was growing up, my mom had relationships with at least 2 other woman and that these women sometimes also shared a bed with both my parents. My dad not only enabled, but encouraged my mom’s gay sex life and also participated in her relationships not only sexually and by spending time with these women, but also by giving her relationship advice. I should probably also mention that these women are all still friends of the family and we see them from time to time. 

About two years ago, she got involved with her hairdresser and apparently became quite smitten with her, but the other girl (the one I said I see as a sister) was still involved with my parents and in a way, my mom basically broke up with that girl and decided to pursue the relationship with the hairdresser while my dad remained with the other girl. In the past two years, things have turned ugly as my mom spends less and less time with her family and more and more time with the hairdresser who is to put it mildly, a manipulative b****. She takes advantage of my mom financially and puts her under immense psychological and emotional pressure and as a result, my siblings and I have all almost entirely given up on having a mother. This has put me under a lot of emotional stress and pain and in confrontations with my mom, I told her I don’t see her as a mom any more and don’t want to have her in my life, but even though she spends around 80% of her waking hours with her ‘girlfriend’ and they’ve apparently rented a place together, she still officially lives at home with us. To make things even more complicated, my dad and his girlfriend (who used to be both their girlfriends) also have a place together and they sometimes spend the night there instead of at home. Despite this, my dad has a far better relationship with all us kids and he says he still really loves my mom even though he’s giving up on her. 

As you can imagine all of this has caused a lot of tension in my family but as incredible and strange as all this may sound to most people, it seems quite normal when you’re living in it, and I guess every family has its issues but what bothers me most is that I can’t even talk to my mom about these things and she is just completely blank because of how weak and submissive she is to this woman. She will sometimes leave the house at the weirdest hours to go see her when they are having an argument or if she just needs my mom to drive her somewhere. When they argue over text, my mom will spend hours crouched up on a couch or in bed texting her back and forth like a dumb 14 year old girl (no offence to 14 year old girls). It’s just all very depressing and I really wanted to get it out there. All kinds of replies including advice or just words of encouragement are highly appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First a bit of background; my parents got married when they were 25 and 16 respectively in a fairly conservative country about 26 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother is retired, 64 years old, an alcoholic and is dealing with some form of memory problems along with some other physical ailments (back problems). She was basically forced into retirement by losing her (decent paying) job from passing out from being drunk while at work and ending up in the hospital. This was two years ago. She gets enough in retirement ss payments to cover her rent and buy groceries. But hardly more than that. She does use food stamps. She lives alone in a small studio apartment. She doesnt work or have hobbies. She basically watches TV and drinks (when she has the money).

Im her son (30) and one of four of her kids. My moms relationship with her kids has been bad for a long time. Mostly due to her drug and alcohol abuse and her poor parenting skills. All of us are adults now with the youngest of us at 27. Two of my siblings have written my mom off completely and have had little to no contact with her for years. Another sibling loves her and cares for her and will be wrecked when shes gone but also can barely take care themselves (in and out of jail, several kids) and has a rocky codependant relationship with my mom that always seems to get worse the longer they are around each other. Right now they live next to each other. I need to move my mom away from him.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have a rocky, emotionally distant relationship with my mom. We dont fight, she shows positivity and warmth towards me. She basically is very proud of me as a person. But my relationship towards her is more complicated and filled with resentment and frustration. But I am basically all that my mom has for support. My moms own brothers and sister have all but written her off as well. To make matters more difficult, I live and work 4 hours away and I cant be with my mom at times when she needs me. Although I am lucky enough to have a job that allows me to go see her whenever I need to, its cost prohibitive to do it more than once a month as I do not own a car and need to rent one. Ive considered buying or even taking over a lease but doing so puts me in a very tight position financially.

&amp;#x200B;

I could ramble on for awhile about all of this but I think I need to hire a therapist for that. For now Im just trying to wrap my head around how I can help my mom. She has health problem she conceals, she doesnt take care of herself, she insists on drinking even though it effects her already declining memory. Shes not a healthy or happy person and I need to know how I can help to make her life better while being limited in what I can do financially. Some things that pop into mind are moving her to some sort of assisted living facility. Not a nursing home but someplace where I can have someone keep an eye on her when I cant be there. I dont know if places like that even exist. Maybe hire a home nurse that could help take her to doctors visits and just check in on her more? Having grown up without much of a relationship with my mom has left me focused on taking care of myself and not preparing or having considered these situations and I dont know where to start.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother is retired, 64 years old, an alcoholic and is dealing with some form of memory problems along with some other physical ailments (back problems). She was basically forced into retirement by losing her (decent paying) job from passing out from being drunk while at work and ending up in the hospital. This was two years ago. She gets enough in retirement ss payments to cover her rent and buy groceries. But hardly more than that. She does use food stamps. She lives alone in a small studio apartment. She doesnt work or have hobbies. She basically watches TV and drinks (when she has the money). &lt;/p&gt;

I have a little bit of a fear of them even though they aren’t abusive, just strict and well rude in all honesty. Being around them leaves me anxious and I rarely want to spend time with them. I don’t have a close relationship with them, I don’t share my worries or problems with them, they often get angry when I won’t open up to them and will say things about how I have to tell them since they’re my parents and they need to know. It comes off as abrasive and overbearing, I hate it. 
They’ve always shown clear favoritism to my older sister, I’ve never been able to live up to her example in most of the hobbies we share. I’m often the afterthought when they talk about us, or I’m used as an unfair comparison to my sister to make her look better. 
Not sure if this is related, but their marriage has never been very good, both of them fight non stop and they used to try to make me choose sides when I was younger. They yell so much that my immediate reaction to a tone shift when in the room with them is to go to another room because I don’t want to caught up in their arguments. I feel like that’s a factor that sort of deters my desire to be around them.
Another note, a lot of my distrust of them stems from the fact that I am closeted, because they’re both homophobic. I’m afraid to come out because I’m sure there will be a negative reaction. My dad often makes homophobic comments that leave me feeling like I’ll never be able to be as close to him as when I was kid. 
It’s all so frustrating and I feel like it’s somewhat my fault for not being able to better connect with them. Like maybe there was something that I was missing that caused our relationship to be this way.
It just leaves me wondering, was there something I could’ve done to fix this? Is it too late? Is it my fault for pulling away? Is it my fault for not being able to fulfill their expectations? Or is this all something that’s out of my control and I was just dealt a bad hand at the beginning of life.

TL;DR I feel like my father has no empathy/consideration of our predicament at all. If not for me/us, he should at least have it for my brother. He's never here. I'm always there for my family. I want them (my family) to be one. They're well suited to look out for each other. They're all victims at the end of the day. Including my dad. But my dad's ego keeps him away from us. He doesn't live with us solely due to his ego.

I'm 29M. I've been playing my father's role within my family for almost 7+ years now. Even when he was with us, there were a lot of problems due to his business endeavors. To this date, he's not willing to accept the financial losses when talking to my mother. I understand his intentions, he was just trying to succeed. I'm not complaining about my role in the unit. I like the responsibility. It makes me accountable. I also feel (at times) that my family doesn't recognize me at all. I'm so good, and I've contributed so much. But they have this idea that I'm someone who's carefree and has no worries. WTF?

I'll give you an example. Medical expenses are mounting this month. We also have to pay maintenance fees for the apartment which are due. I've been running around the whole day looking to secure a loan and had to take off a lot of time (I'm working today, btw) for paperwork and documentation. I still have to make follow-up calls and meet a couple of people with regards to money/outstanding bills. For crying out loud, I couldn't even go into work to fetch my notebook's charger. 

I'm always the one to call my dad and follow up with him on family, health etc. Heck, it's the same with all of my family. They rarely take the initiative to start productive conversations. And when they do, they tend to get overly emotional. (Especially my mum and grand mum). With my dad and brother, it's the opposite. They're distant. How can they not realize that we're all in it together? It's so annoying to be stuck in this situation. Logically, it makes sense that I carry the family's responsibilities. I'm not disputing that. But shouldn't my father at least have some kind of conscience? It'd be really great if my mum/grand mum were less emotional and more objective too.

Take for example, yesterday. I really wanted to go to Free Solo. I'd even booked the tickets. But my mother kinda wanted the last of my money. I didn't even have the money to make it to the movie even though I had the ticket. And I had a really rough weekend, in terms of work and family issues. I just wanted to unwind and relax for a while and I was unable to do it. I'm not blaming them for it. But it's things like this. They add up after a bit. I have no real way of relating to the situation either, as I don't know people who went through similar stuff. Nobody's family is perfect. Everybody has issues. I get it. No such thing called a perfect family. But it's the balance that counts. Everybody's gotta be willing to take one for the team. Everybody's gotta evolve. Make an active effort. It can't be just one person naively trying to be the be-all-end-all every single time.

I'm not even expecting money from my father. How much would it take for him to just live with us and provide emotional support to the rest of the unit (specifically my brother) so I can deal with the real brunt of the labor (work, money, and management) and situation? It'd ease things by quite a bit. And it's purely ego that's making him stay away. What should I do in this situation? Assertively request him to move back in? I just feel so disillusioned, frustrated, and angry at times. I know these feelings pass, but you get the idea.

Some feedback would be appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read these posts for background on my family. My mum/dad had an arranged marriage (forced).

But they have this idea that I&amp;#39;m someone who&amp;#39;s carefree and has no worries. WTF?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll give you an example. Medical expenses are mounting this month. We also have to pay maintenance fees for the apartment which are due. I&amp;#39;ve been running around the whole day looking to secure a loan and had to take off a lot of time (I&amp;#39;m working today, btw) for paperwork and documentation. I still have to make follow-up calls and meet a couple of people with regards to money/outstanding bills. For crying out loud, I couldn&amp;#39;t even go into work to fetch my notebook&amp;#39;s charger. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m always the one to call my dad and follow up with him on family, health etc. Heck, it&amp;#39;s the same with all of my family. They rarely take the initiative to start productive conversations. And when they do, they tend to get overly emotional. (Especially my mum and grand mum). With my dad and brother, it&amp;#39;s the opposite. They&amp;#39;re distant. How can they not realize that we&amp;#39;re all in it together? It&amp;#39;s so annoying to be stuck in this situation. Logically, it makes sense that I carry the family&amp;#39;s responsibilities. I&amp;#39;m not disputing that. But shouldn&amp;#39;t my father at least have some kind of conscience? It&amp;#39;d be really great if my mum/grand mum were less emotional and more objective too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take for example, yesterday. I really wanted to go to Free Solo. I&amp;#39;d even booked the tickets. But my mother kinda wanted the last of my money. I didn&amp;#39;t even have the money to make it to the movie even though I had the ticket. And I had a really rough weekend, in terms of work and family issues. I just wanted to unwind and relax for a while and I was unable to do it. I&amp;#39;m not blaming them for it. But it&amp;#39;s things like this. They add up after a bit. I have no real way of relating to the situation either, as I don&amp;#39;t know people who went through similar stuff. Nobody&amp;#39;s family is perfect. Everybody has issues. I get it. No such thing called a perfect family. But it&amp;#39;s the balance that counts. Everybody&amp;#39;s gotta be willing to take one for the team. Everybody&amp;#39;s gotta evolve. Make an active effort. It can&amp;#39;t be just one person naively trying to be the be-all-end-all every single time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not even expecting money from my father. How much would it take for him to just live with us and provide emotional support to the rest of the unit (specifically my brother) so I can deal with the real brunt of the labor (work, money, and management) and situation? It&amp;#39;d ease things by quite a bit. And it&amp;#39;s purely ego that&amp;#39;s making him stay away. What should I do in this situation? Assertively request him to move back in? I just feel so disillusioned, frustrated, and angry at times. I know these feelings pass, but you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some feedback would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

It's in no particular order than that of which it came into my brain. Enjoy.

&amp;#x200B;

* My sister is a narcissist that has adult tantrums to get what she wants
* My sister has a huge victim complex and plays the victim to manipulate our parents
* My mum believes her bs and has been rationalising her tantrums for over 10 years, always referring to some external factor that is ""giving her a hard time at the moment"". 
* My dad would say nasty things about my mum in private and expect me to agree with him
* My dad would put me down and pick on me, with my sister, using things I was sensitive about (I got picked on at school for being skinny as a kid and my dad and her picked on me for that too - HE GOT BULLIED FOR THAT TOO AS A KID)
* My dad would compete with me in some of the weirdest ways, for example he bought me a nice gaming computer for christmas once, then bought himself one that was twice as powerful saying it's for ""work"" lol. He was also a gamer tho
* My dad saw me as an extension of his legacy, when he was a programmer he kept trying to force me to become one, then as an electrician he was telling me how he wants to ""take over the family business"" (btw he ended up going bankrupt cos he's a horrible businessman lol)
* My dad told my mum we were going through ""hard times"" and he didn't have much money, could she please take out debt on her credit cards. She maxed her credit cards, he put money away in a separate account ,then left her
* My sister has two personalities, one with her immediate family where she's a complete bitch and we have to walk on eggshells around her, and if an outsider is around she will immediately flip to being a nice, bubbly girl who's always laughing and smiling. Oh and btw comparing herself to me, to ""subtly"" (or she thinks) tell everyone how much better she is lol. I mean yeah she's pretty talented and nobody denies that, she's very artistic unlike myself, but I guess also insecure about it.
* I have to walk on eggshells around my sister, put up with her constant bs and putting me down (when I broke the news I split up with a gf I was in love with, she immediately began to laugh at me, in front of my mum who said nothing btw, and put me down for it telling me I'll die alone. Haha good one sis)
* If I refuse to put up with this level of crap, my sister gets into a mood where she won't talk to me and overreacts. She's getting married btw, and I shouted at her, once, when she was being an irritating bitch, putting me down constantly, right after our grandmother died and I was a bit on edge, so she cut communication with me and uninvited me from her wedding. She's the real victim here, folks, and she must play the part.
* My mum will beg me to ""just get along with my sister"" (see: put up with her constant crap, and her attempts to find dirt to embarrass me in front of family members while simultaneously propping herself up as some sort of wonder-woman). The last time we ""fell out"" I refused and my mum starts crying, after years of this nonsense I tell her enough is enough but no, my mum and my sister are the victims and I'm a cold hearted bastard
* My mum keeps saying some strange shit to me lately. I've never shared a lot with my mum, but she's always tried to pry, however it's going beyond that. Lately she asked how an ""ex"" ( a girl I dated for 1 month when I was 15) was doing. I said she ended up getting pregnant at like 17 and having a kid. My mum says ""that could have been you"". I told her ""wtf of course not"". ""You never know, son. Imagine that was you""... huh? Really uncomfortable situation
* My mum constantly complains about her dad. How he's always outside doing random ""jobs"" that don't need doing. How he's not doing the ""jobs"" that do need doing. How he doesn't do anything she asks him to do right there and then. How he's only watching crap on TV. How now he's not watching anything on TV anymore, just sitting there doing nothing. How he's so malodramatic in pretending that his leg is hurting (a car fell onto his leg like 40 years ago, he had some surgery to reconstruct his knee but he's always had pain and problems) or how he's playing on his vertigo. How he keeps ""hoarding"" stuff like old wood (which he ends up using btw to re-use to build fences and so on) in a shed outside that she herself NEVER goes in. She'll go in like once every 2 months then get mad that it's messy and tell him to throw it out
* I have to put up with an uncle who won't have a normal conversation with me, only talk to me sarcastically, for the sake of my mum. When he comes over I don't go to the living room to sit with everyone and hang out with him, but according to her I should, because the poor guy just doesn't know what to say, and he's just trying to bond with me or something
* I have an aunty that I get along with but my mum despises. This aunty said one ""mean"" thing to my sister once about 8 years ago now and my mum is still mad about it. Being the reasonable person that she is, my mum let's me maintain a relationship with her but constantly guilt trip me by telling me how mean she was to my sister one time and how she's a bad person
* My mum's sister in law texts her a lot, usually random crap and my mum gets annoyed and proclaims how she has decided to ignore her messages and only reply every 3 hours or so. Eventually, she stops replying altogether, my aunty then stops texting her, and my mum gets mad that my aunty is ""in a mood"" and no longer texting. Typical Marie!!! She's so hot and cold!
* My grandad's wife, my nan, her own mother, died recently. She was aged 77 and her and my grandad have been dating since around 14 years old. My grandad has been slipping into a depression and my mum just COMPLAINS how he cannot do that because she needs someone to walk the dog in the morning and he should ""snap out of it""
* My mum has such a victim complex that like my sister I've always been careful not to rebel or complain or even \*gasp\* disagree with her because she gets upset. At this point I just want to scream at her to stop being such a selfish bitch and support her dad who is clearly suffering after the love of his life passed away instead of telling me how pathetic he is. 
* My mum got a dog and my sister GOT MAD AT ME because I tried to teach it to sit on the first day. ISNT THAT WHAT YOURE MEANT TO DO? No, actually, I'm cruel and the dog is ""too young for that"", instead we should coddle it, let it bite us, let is become a misbehaving brat, and in about 6 months time we can begin to train it. This resulted in, you guessed it, my sister having a tantrum when my mum and everyone else agreed with me that yes you train your dog from the first day. In the end, she got her way, and now my mum has a dog she can't control, that she constantly makes excuses for - just like she does for my sister's tantrums LOL. If this wasn't my damn life it would be funny. I'm sick of calling home and hearing about how my dog has been ""behaving this week, but now we're taking a backwards turn because he's biting again"".

&amp;#x200B;

I'm studying abroad now and I only call home like every 2 weeks at this point. I don't text my mum anymore on facebook. I'm sick of calling back and my mum isn't interested about my life at all, only wants to complain about her stupid shitty problems and her dad. She also likes to update me on my sister's life and pretend like we still get along. She doesn't even acknowledge the fact we don't, most of the time. I DONT FUCKING CARE ANYMORE. I'm done.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been trying to sum up my family problems but there&amp;#39;s too much to write.

Also I am on mobile blah blah blah.... ok BACKGROUND! 

It happened about back in September I had lost a few clients so I was low on funds so my brother says “hey Vanessa* (not real name) is going to school now come over watch the boys, we just need you for a few hours.” Boys at time we’re 3-5 one in school.

Me: ok sure when? 

Brother:most afternoons Monday-Friday? 

Me: sure. 
After about two weeks a few new prospects clients popped up and I told my brother it wasn’t working. His wife would leave at 2:30 I would get there for 2:15 watch the two boys and leave at 4-5 pm when my brother would come home. Until one evening I was about to leave to go to another client. He was furious! I said what I have other people besides you that rely on me. He said I was going to my motorcycles buddy’s birthday party! You are supposed to stay and watch the kids!! 

Funny nobody confirmed this with me. He threw a tantrum, I didn’t budge so I helped put the kids to bed and left, he stayed home sat on the couch fuming. No big deal right? Fast forward a few months he asks me again can you watch the kids in end of February to mid-April? Forgetting about the birthday night, I agreed. Then he mentions the times, I just wave it off until the week before I was suppose to work, his wife Vanessa mentions the time and my jaw drops. 5:45 am, ok that’s no problem I worked that early before when I worked as a caregiver. So since my boyfriend at the time and had I split up, I temporarily moved in with my brother, and slept on an air mattress in the guest room and had my cat who was just adopted to stay with me. 

Within the first week there was so many problems. The five now six year old has autism, high functioning. 
I wasn’t allowed to go to work so I had to stay close or in the house and wait for the children. Which a lot more of my clients dropped me because of. Brother got mad when I took a client on who was close to the house saying I was “double dipping” 
My brother would berate me in front of his friends as if to say I was a shitty worker for watching his kids. 
He would also say you shouldn’t work your job when you get more money here. I work for $25.00 an hour cleaning and about chump change doing food deliveries for people. I don’t like people who compare rates of how much I’m working. Not cool. 
I missed a doctors/therapist appointment and told him I had to leave by 2:30, him and his wife showed up at 4:30 saying traffic was the enemy. 150.00 I’m not getting back. 

Anyways so that leads to today. 
They had told me about two weeks ago that they needed one weekend day, to let Vanessa last day of practicum for a weekend shift. Ok great, I didn’t put it in my calendar because I thought ok it’s a Sunday what is the likelihood of me being booked with a client or work? Well the same time I was booking a long time client  who paid in advance, that had me in her books for a while we normally do Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday’s whatever days work. So she said those days don’t work, how does Sunday work? I didn’t think I said sure and put her in the books. I put her in for the afternoon and left it at that. Until last week I realized what I did, and frantically tried to change it with the client. She said all the times I had listed won’t work for her. So I called my brother and wife and told them my problem, only to be met with “You are here for us! You promised to be here for us! Tell your other client to cancel! Immediately!” To which I mentioned to them that unlike them, this client paid in advance. 
This made them more furious, saying I was an asshole for canceling, no I didn’t say I was canceling I didn’t say this. I did say “to be more than fair I will still come, but I need to leave by 12:30, either you, your wife, my mom, can come home and take over.” I talked to my mom afterwards my brother never called. I sent that text on Friday and never heard anything for a day and a half. So I knew in my heart he would fuck me over for his personal needs to be met. I came home after work and went to bed and put my phone on do not disturb. This morning I awoke to a barrage of berating texts and calls from everything to “your an asshole! How dare you not show up!” “You want to play this game two can play at that game!” Finally ending with “FUCK YOU!” I said really what I needed to say, they never confirmed with me on the care of their children. 

Edit: Fast forward a few days and I ask the company that pays the workers of my brothers kids, (since the older one has a speech therapist that comes over every few days to watch/play with the kids) if I could get my cheque. 
I sent a text that went like this 

Me: Hey ******! I forgot to text you but last week I worked ??? hours. I was suppose to work Sunday, but there was an issue due to somebody watching the kids. 

No response, I texted and called the following day only to met with again. 

Them: I’m out of town until next week, oh and by the way My payday for staff is every second Friday. I’ve been doing Bro a favour by paying you weekly.  I will have someone drop off a cheque with Bro by Friday. Pls contact Bro for pick up.

Then bro texts me (how convenient) 

r/thinkpinkhair Quit bothering ***** for your cheque your lucky I even pay you as you have been overpaid in the first few weeks of working for us . Maybe an apology is in order . Or not your call? Or some honesty? 

I told him Do you self a favour and apologize to me for the fact you never got back to me round out with a go duck yourself. 

The lady got back to me after I sent a LONG TEXT I won’t post it here but it ended with her seeing my side of things and realizing my brother was being an A-hole...but sad thing is I won’t get paid next week, messing up my car payment. That’s how f***ed up this is. Am I still not the A-hole in this?

This morning I called the lady this morning about cheque, no response, I called them mom, she said we would meet at the end of her driveway away from the kids and bro to get cheque. Texted her a few hours ago, she told me nobody came by with a cheque so I’m out money.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok to be fair I will offer some background then you can make your judgements and comments on me afterwards. Also I am on mobile blah blah blah.... ok BACKGROUND! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It happened about back in September I had lost a few clients so I was low on funds so my brother says “hey Vanessa* (not real name) is going to school now come over watch the boys, we just need you for a few hours.” Boys at time we’re 3-5 one in school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: ok sure when? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brother:most afternoons Monday-Friday? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: sure. 
After about two weeks a few new prospects clients popped up and I told my brother it wasn’t working. His wife would leave at 2:30 I would get there for 2:15 watch the two boys and leave at 4-5 pm when my brother would come home. Until one evening I was about to leave to go to another client. He was furious! I said what I have other people besides you that rely on me. He said I was going to my motorcycles buddy’s birthday party! You are supposed to stay and watch the kids!! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funny nobody confirmed this with me. He threw a tantrum, I didn’t budge so I helped put the kids to bed and left, he stayed home sat on the couch fuming. No big deal right? Fast forward a few months he asks me again can you watch the kids in end of February to mid-April? Forgetting about the birthday night, I agreed. Then he mentions the times, I just wave it off until the week before I was suppose to work, his wife Vanessa mentions the time and my jaw drops. 5:45 am, ok that’s no problem I worked that early before when I worked as a caregiver. So since my boyfriend at the time and had I split up, I temporarily moved in with my brother, and slept on an air mattress in the guest room and had my cat who was just adopted to stay with me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the first week there was so many problems. The five now six year old has autism, high functioning. 
I wasn’t allowed to go to work so I had to stay close or in the house and wait for the children. Which a lot more of my clients dropped me because of. Brother got mad when I took a client on who was close to the house saying I was “double dipping” 
My brother would berate me in front of his friends as if to say I was a shitty worker for watching his kids. 
He would also say you shouldn’t work your job when you get more money here. I work for $25.00 an hour cleaning and about chump change doing food deliveries for people. I don’t like people who compare rates of how much I’m working. Not cool. 
I missed a doctors/therapist appointment and told him I had to leave by 2:30, him and his wife showed up at 4:30 saying traffic was the enemy. 150.00 I’m not getting back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways so that leads to today. 
They had told me about two weeks ago that they needed one weekend day, to let Vanessa last day of practicum for a weekend shift. Ok great, I didn’t put it in my calendar because I thought ok it’s a Sunday what is the likelihood of me being booked with a client or work? Well the same time I was booking a long time client  who paid in advance, that had me in her books for a while we normally do Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday’s whatever days work. So she said those days don’t work, how does Sunday work? I didn’t think I said sure and put her in the books. I put her in for the afternoon and left it at that. Until last week I realized what I did, and frantically tried to change it with the client. She said all the times I had listed won’t work for her. So I called my brother and wife and told them my problem, only to be met with “You are here for us! You promised to be here for us! Tell your other client to cancel! Immediately!” To which I mentioned to them that unlike them, this client paid in advance. 
This made them more furious, saying I was an asshole for canceling, no I didn’t say I was canceling I didn’t say this. I did say “to be more than fair I will still come, but I need to leave by 12:30, either you, your wife, my mom, can come home and take over.” I talked to my mom afterwards my brother never called.

I am a Christian since I begin a journey with God when I was in primary school. As a kid I always enjoyed Bible studies as I never had them at home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday I am almost 22 years old and my step father hasn\'t told me that I am not his biological daughter. It gets much more complicated and this is why I need advice and someone to guide me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother had me when she was 19 years old. I do not know all the reasons but my biological father and my mother split after I was born because my bio father liked partying too much. My mother met my step father after that and when I turned 3 years old they asked me a question: Do I want to call him dad or uncle. I chose dad. After that I cant remember much but I remember attending my bio fathers, brothers wedding and after that nothing. When I was 4 my mother and step father married. My brother was 4 months by that time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDue to circumstances my mother and father had to work and I was left under my grandmothers supervision, I practically stayed there. I am just not sure how long. I saw my parents often, but my grandmother and I got close and I started asking questions. I asked my grandmother why they act like I don\'t have another father, thing is, everyone pushed that idea away. Soon my mother was in the loop that I knew and it became a secret. My step father wasn\'t aloud to know I knew. Today I still don\'t understand why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I went to primary school my mother started taking me to see my bio father, but my step dad wasn\'t aloud to know. The secret just kept on. When we visited him my bio father was introduced as our uncle because my brother was around and he might tell my dad. It became a thing almost the whole family knew and it was all kept from my dad. I was a kid at the time and didn\'t know what I do today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo life started changing. We moved to another town and away from my bio father. When we went to visit my grandmother, my mom would still let us visit my bio father secretly. Until we moved even further to another province and we lost touch with my bio father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom was always afraid my dad would find out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn high school I asked my grandmother for my bio fathers number to get in touch again, which we did. I was in grade 9 when I arranged that he could come to my netball game in another town because my parents weren\'t going to be there. He came.\n\nSoon after that my step dad and I started fighting a lot. My high school years were the worst. We never saw I to eye and in every way I was doing wrong. I wasn\'t a troubled child at all. I had good grades, helped my mother in the house, 100% school attendance and really respected everyone. I felt life was very unfair. My bio father and I lost touch again, but I could stop wondering how things could be if it wasn\'t a secret.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI turned to God in a way I never did before. I left all the negativity behind and started focusing on my future, I really built a strong relationship with Him and since then, things got better. Although we still fought often, I handled it better. I said words were just words and I knew I am worth it. I really gave my all in my last few years in school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn grade 12 I wished the time to pass so that I could get put of the house and start my life, I really struggled with things and our pastor gave me advise when I asked. Closer to the end of my last year in netball I made contact with my bio father again as we where going to play the last match of the season in the town he lived in. He came. But this time things were different. I felt that he was the missing piece, but as we stood there and spoke to each other I just realized that we knew nothing about each other and that he just kept on making empty promises.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always kept my mother in the loop when I contacted my bio father, but it remained a secret. My mother and I fought once because I told her that I was going to tell my dad, but she just cried and demanded that I don\'t.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext year I moved out and went to the city to study. My dad and I got closer like we never did before. My mother and I just couldn\'t do the telephone calls, was just weird. Time went on and they had plans to move to another town about 1500km away. I was kindly demanded to come with. So after my studies that year, I did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a month in the new town I told my dad that I wanted to go back and finish my degree. He just said he knew this was going to happen and said that if I do, I am on my own. I was ok with that because I always felt like an outsider. Next morning I went to work, my dad had a business and we all did the whole family business thing, lets just say he asked me to resign. So I did. But I never felt so broken in my entire life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI  started looking for a job and less that two weeks later I started at the new place. My dad and I weren\'t on good terms. He just said he couldn\'t trust me, later he said he meant it as a joke.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe year after that came and I started saving for my plans, but unfortunately couldn\'t study online. I made peace and did the gap year thing. I got frustrated not doing something with my future when I started with my life long passion as a hobby - photography. My part time business started going well. My dad of course made remarks like ""pretend photographer who think she knows everything"" and other comments similar to that. It hurt me but as I always did, I hid it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater that year I got accepted at a university in the city and told my mother about if first. I asked her how I should tell my dad because I knew how it went last time. A day or two later I went to the living room and told him that I am continuing my studies the following year and will be moving to the city end that year. All he said was: ""Goodluck."" He didn\'t even look at me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTime went on and my photography kept me occupied. I was soon ready to make the move.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am here now. It is 2019, I have a great job, a very supportive boyfriend (long distance) and I am currently continuing my degree in BCom Business Management. My only problem is that I want to tell my dad that I know he isn\'t my bio father and that I am more that happy that he is my dad because even though we aren\'t as close as we were, I love him dearly. My biggest problem is that if I tell him I know, I also have to tell him that my mother knew and it might mean the end of their marriage, I do not know what to do or how to do it.

We are only 20 months apart, we grew up in the same house with the same parents with just each other and no other siblings but my brother has always hated me.

We shared a room until I was about 8-9yrs old because my brother wanted his own space.  He tortured me, beat me, physically and emotionally abused me, he beat me up at school he literally beat the life force out of me.  He hit me with a car once - and I was such a weak and emotionally sad child I kept running back to him trying to get him to like me and his approval.  He did an incredible number on my mind.

I have maybe one or two pleasant memories with him.  Most are awful.

I was diagnosed with PTSD because of how severe the abuse was and how it manifested in my adult life.  I have struggled with addiction and I know that is a direct cause.  I had to learn to relive again.

My parents chalked it up to kids will be kids and brothers will get along - no matter how terrified or unsafe I was.  It wasn’t until my late 20s (I am 33 years old and I still dream about him hurting me) that I stopped being scared about him.

It sucks because I cannot get over it.  My parents are the type where they say “we did the best we could” and have allowed me to bare the burden of all this shame and responsibility and pain on my own.  Even as an adult I have tried to make peace and my brother still wants nothing to do with me.  

Add all this I’m gay and unsupported in that aspect of my family and I’m certain my mother believes if I wasn’t gay that my brother would like me and so therefore she blames me for that too. 

I don’t know how to get past this.  I feel like I’m gonna carry this pain forever even though I don’t want to.  I’ve been in therapy for 7 years which makes it hurt just a little less.

Growing up I barely knew him. He divorced my mother when I was 2 years old so he could leave for Navy-related things. He was about to be sent out to California (I'm from Ohio), and so he left me with my mother to prevent me from having to move every 2-4 years to different places. Through the next 6 years, I saw him maybe about 2 weeks each year. He would come back to Ohio around Thanksgiving and stay with my stepmom's family. Yes, after leaving my mother (and $80,000 in debt), he remarried and decided to help raise her son she already had. I guess I should be glad I didn't have to move around the country like my stepbrother did. However, considering I have no siblings and only lived with my mother at home, and how she always moved into neighborhoods where there weren't other children so it stayed more quiet, I grew up very lonely.

Other than his yearly visits, I visited him in Virginia Beach in 2008, and then again in Massachusetts in 2015 and 2016, where we also went down to Virginia Beach for a week during that time. He visited again for a few days to check on his parents last April. I only saw him for 2 or 3 days during then. One day we went to get ice cream from this famous place in town, and he said to me, ""you know, I always wished I could do this with you. Go out and do stuff like this."" Oh yeah, *totally.* If he wished he could do that, he wouldn't have left me and my mother. 

He came back to Ohio last year during Thanksgiving again. Instead of coming to actually visit me, he again went to my stepmother's sister's house. I used to get along well with my cousin there, especially so since he's only one of two people anywhere relatively close to me in the family that's my age. I was the first child born in the family in a 15 year gap, meaning all of my cousins are adults now, pretty much, aside from two. However, I didn't go visit him because when he came down last April, he went there, and I did too. My cousin shut himself up in his room playing Fortnite, which I don't play, and I was left alone for majority of the day. I wouldn't go through that again, it's a waste of time. Since I didn't see him then, it means I haven't seen him in more than a year.

Also when he was in town last April, he told me he was supposed to give me $20,000 to help pay for college. Instead he gave it to my stepbrother to help him pay his fifth year off, and expected him to pay it back. Guess what he didn't do? He didn't need that money. He made tens of thousands of dollars during summer break driving tour buses in Denali National Park. He made more than enough to pay off his college, yet my dad gave him the money he meant for me. Now, I'm never going to get that money. And considering I'm getting no financial help from my mother or anyone else in my family, I have to pay for college all on my own.

I have graduation in about a month. For the last few months he told me he would be able to make it to graduation. I was glad to hear he would at least be there, but today, he told me he most likely wouldn't be able to make it.

He said he would be retiring from the Navy at the end of 2020, if he doesn't get deployed overseas one last time. But the thing is, even if he does retire, he won't come back to Ohio. He says he wants to move either to Spain or Poland.

I really wish I could like my father, but he's just a piece of shit. The times I've been with him, he's a cool guy. But he's never been there for me, he didn't bother raising me, he gave away my college money, and now he can't even come to my graduation, not like he's tried any effort to do so. I don't even consider him my father anymore. He's like a distant relative that's fun to hang around. I just don't know what to think of him. All of this about him makes me want to be a really good father for when I have kids one day. I want to be there for them, and not have them go what I went through.

Along the way, I started dating this amazing guy who I love to spend time with as much as possible. Then I got a new job that required me moving two hours away, but my boyfriend and I set up a system where I would drive to see him one weekend, and he would drive and see me the next weekend.

We have little time with one another outside of texting, calling, and video chatting throughout the week. But whenever I am in town, my family continually wants me to spend as much time with them as possible. They usually call or text every day to learn what I am doing and what my weekly plans are. My family, however, is overwhelming and I have been trying to limit time with them.

When I visited them for dinner one night, they bombarded me with so many questions and kept interrupting and cutting me off to talk about themselves (interrupting is usual, and is met with, ""I just thought you were done already.""). It sent me into a panic attack and stressed me out. I didn't even eat dinner. When I tell them that they are overwhelming, they look hurt and say, ""But we are just trying to spend time with you. Calm down!"" and later sarcastically say, ""Are we overwhelming you yet?""

Now when I come over, my Mom bombards me questions, nags me about finances and all the things I am not doing that I should be. She then sends food back with me, then jokes about how reliant I still am on them when I buy my own groceries and make my own. She tells me I lack responsibility and need drive, then other times she tells me to ""go with the flow and relax.""

It has not been fun when I visit my family for the last few weeks and was getting tiring when I lived with them. The thing is, if I told them I would see them next time, they would probably be hurt and call me more often. Call me a jerk, but I don't know how to balance time with them along with my boyfriend.

Along the way, I started dating this amazing guy who I love to spend time with as much as possible. Then I got a new job that required me moving two hours away, but my boyfriend and I set up a system where I would drive to see him one weekend, and he would drive and see me the next weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have little time with one another outside of texting, calling, and video chatting throughout the week. But whenever I am in town, my family continually wants me to spend as much time with them as possible. They usually call or text every day to learn what I am doing and what my weekly plans are. My family, however, is overwhelming and I have been trying to limit time with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I visited them for dinner one night, they bombarded me with so many questions and kept interrupting and cutting me off to talk about themselves (interrupting is usual, and is met with, &amp;quot;I just thought you were done already.&amp;quot;). It sent me into a panic attack and stressed me out. I didn&amp;#39;t even eat dinner. When I tell them that they are overwhelming, they look hurt and say, &amp;quot;But we are just trying to spend time with you. Calm down!&amp;quot; and later sarcastically say, &amp;quot;Are we overwhelming you yet?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when I come over, my Mom bombards me questions, nags me about finances and all the things I am not doing that I should be. She then sends food back with me, then jokes about how reliant I still am on them when I buy my own groceries and make my own. She tells me I lack responsibility and need drive, then other times she tells me to &amp;quot;go with the flow and relax.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has not been fun when I visit my family for the last few weeks and was getting tiring when I lived with them. The thing is, if I told them I would see them next time, they would probably be hurt and call me more often. Call me a jerk, but I don&amp;#39;t know how to balance time with them along with my boyfriend. They are both important.&lt;/p&gt;

Recently I found out that my sister (11 yrs old) is dating a man (22 yrs old) in the internet. My cousin reported it to me when she accidentally discovered their conversation when my sister used my cousin's phone. Basically my cousin frantically messaged me about how shes feeling really guilty for accidentally discovering my sister's weird conversation with this man. 

I asked her to show pictures of their conversation and she pictured some of them.

I also previously suspected that my sister was seeing guys in the internet but i didnt think it was this bad.

Technically they exchanged conversations that included sexual things and her cussing about how she hates her life. I saw their conversation about how this man was asking my sister to take a picture of her boobs. It wasnt in a forceful way but rather something like this ""can you send picture of ur boobs? Just tell me if you took one already. You can just send it to me when you're ready"" to which my sister would reply ""Alright. Only when i turn 18 though~""

They also had sexual roleplays and i saw messages where my sister was asking him about his dick size and if it was big and long. Also about her messaging him how she was super horny and the guy telling her that she should wait.

My cousin said that shes actually going to send him a picture of her boobs next Thursday. I dont know what to do since it might cause a lot of family drama and my dad is known for being harsh. 

I dont think he will go soft on her this time since she was caught previously before which was last summer and my dad got super angry and she got really depressed.

She has suicidal tendencies too. I honestly dont want her to hurt herself because even though she treats me badly most of the time and is currently giving me the ""i hate you"" face, some suggestive middle finger signs and cuss words; she's still my sister and I still care for her wellbeing.

I also dont want to bring this up with her and talk about it to her since I'm scared that she'll get very defensive and spill some secrets that she knows about me that could lead me into trouble.

I really hope that i could get some helpful advice from you guys because i dont want my family to fall apart. I used to be in a abusing household which caused me some trauma and so im scared that my family would revert back to those old ways of disciplining.

He screamed at me, telling me to talk with my mom (to tell her that I'm going out). Seems normal, but I was not having it. So I screamed back at him saying that my  mom already knows it.

This is when he just blew up. He got up from the sofa and chased me. Then he hit me. Well, honestly it didn't really hurt so I'm okay. My mom heard us and tried to stop us. I didn't talk back or try to hit him back, I just glared at him. He didn't like that and continued to hit me. My mom was panicking and tried to talk to him, but he was not satisfied yet. He told her that I'm too arrogant and if he didn't teach me a lesson, I would become more and more cocky to the point of not obeying my parents anymore. I saw red. I honestly can't believe that he would say that, as my dad. So i talk back to him saying ""Or maybe it's not me that's arrogant, it's just your low self esteem."" He didn't like that and again hit my head (using a book this time). 

Eventually my mom succeeded in seperating us. And it didn't grow into a much bigger problem. 

Am I an entitled child? For talking back to him and all. I know that I was at fault but I just can't help myself. These days I just can't think of him as my dad. He has stopped working for several years now, and my mom is the one supporting my family financially. But, I do wish that I can start to understand him as he is indeed my biological dad even if I don't like his action. And my mom has told me that I need to respect him more as my dad. And I know he at least have tried to be a nicer dad and he still do loves me. I mean, he did hit me but not in the way of until I'm hurt physically. 

I'm confused on where to start so that I can be a better daughter.

Sorry for the long rant.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was close to him when I was younger. Idk when it started but our relationship just goes downhill the older I get. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today, I got into a fight with him. I was going out to my chinese tutoring. Just as I got down from the stairs he asked me on where am I going, etc. I was in a hurry as I was quite late already so I just answered half heartedly and proceed to zoom out from my house. He screamed at me, telling me to talk with my mom (to tell her that I&amp;#39;m going out). Seems normal, but I was not having it. So I screamed back at him saying that my  mom already knows it. But still I went back and told my mom annoyedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is when he just blew up. He got up from the sofa and chased me. Then he hit me. Well, honestly it didn&amp;#39;t really hurt so I&amp;#39;m okay. My mom heard us and tried to stop us. I didn&amp;#39;t talk back or try to hit him back, I just glared at him. He didn&amp;#39;t like that and continued to hit me.

She has been particularly cruel to me for years on end now and I am so emotionally drained and anxious and I am moving out of the apartment we share in a few months (and moving in with my long term partner) and plan to completely cut her out of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

The only problem is my parents are only seeing her side of the story and they're angry that I made the decision to move out. When I decided I was moving out, I gave her six months notice so she could plan a share house with some friends or other university students or save some money to find a cheap place (we are both at university). Since I told her three months ago, she has worked five hours a week max and she is given money from the government every week - she has made no effort to sort something out. She has no bills whatsoever. I however, have been working full time while studying full-time so I can afford to buy furniture and pay a bond etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I am really upset because my parents are only showing support for her and are angry with me. I have been working extremely hard, I am always stressed and either studying or at work. I have no time to hang with friends and my chronic pain condition has flared up. This would all be fine as I know I am just taking responsibility, if my parents showed equal support or my sister worked just as hard. However, she works one shift a week in retail and spends a lot of her time hanging out with friends or sitting around the house etc. yet my parents are treating her like she is a victim. She has been so cruel to me when living together - she has kicked me out of the apartment, yelled at me so many times, picked fights and overall been emotionally abusive towards me. I am just really upset that my parents are picking sides and they have made it clear that they have no interest in helping me out. They are angry that I am ""ditching her"" despite the fact she has told me she hates me and wants me gone and act like its my fault that she has no one to live with even though it's her fault as she has said she hates living with people and will never move into a share house despite the fact that our parents pay for all of her bills. It's particularly hypocritical as last year, she said she wanted a place on her own and my parents said they were going to pay for it + furniture and she said she was going to move out in a month but decided against it because she couldn't find somewhere where she could also get a pet - but when I say I want to move out, I am a horrible person and get given no support and everyone is angry with me.

She has always been the favourite sibling, but it has just got to the point where I am so sad and over being treated like I am worthless to my parents while she has everything just handed to her and can't do no wrong. The whole situation has just started taking its toll on me on an emotional and even physical level and I am starting to feel like I am worthless and unlovable. It isn't about the money but the lack of support and favouritism for only one child. What should I do? Confronting my parents is useless as they just get angry and go on and on about how unfair it is that I'm moving out etc. I don't even know if I want to be apart of this family anymore. Do you think its worth just moving on?

When we give gifts to them they sit in a corner or not used..... i made something for them that was expensive and took a few weeks to make.... she knew about it and then gives me shampoo set from the discount store... than gives someone the spouse of one her kids expensive tools that he will never use...and they never give any gift or thank you


when they go to their other home they have to pass our town and when they do they are literally 5 mins from from my house or they could take this other road that sees less traffic and it’s about 15 mins quicker.... 9 times out of 10 the only time they stop buy is to use our bathroom and refill their coffee and they leave. They normally go the quick way ....  

When they do come to visit they talk about anything and everything and use words our kids know are not allowed and are words that I consider hate ....and they give me dirty looks when I ask them to not use that language....

When We go to their house i read a lot because they never include me and so they ask what so am reading and they laugh make fun of it... when we join in discussions I normally don’t align with their political view and they call my views and beliefs  bad things

I being sentimental stopped talking to little brother and younger sister. Even though I barely talked to them, we talked like with eyes.

Then we have grown older.

 I handpicked a university for my little brother. I prepared him for that. And my younger sister who loves to shop and eat food outside. Whenever she buys something. She will always buy something for me, my mom and my little brother. And if she goes to any fancy place to eat with her friends. She will always bring a parcel for us. That's like a must.

 Even just 2 days ago. At 3 am, I had found out that I have mo balance in my mobile. So I just called my sister to send me some money on my mobile so I can call. There is this online mobile balance recharge thingy. I don't have a subscription to that. She did it in 10 min. 

I am my younger sister and little brother's go to guy when they need money or any idea or information. If I tell them it's all good. They just accept it. 

And my mother, she is like the coolest mom on earth. She has more friends then all our brother sisters combined. She has a morning walk group, a cooking group , a prayer group friends.. They all have a party in our house once a month atleast. 
I and my mom always have these little chat every morning at 5am. We both wake up really early. My other bros and sis don't wake up early.

So every day at 5 am .. We have a little chat over some tea and biscuits. Our topics are always random. Sometimes we talk about health, exercise, food, families, current affairs, etc. 

I Just hope that we can stay the same until our end.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are 3 brothers and 1 sensitive, emotional lovely sister. My father died 6 years ago. My dad used to work abroad. So my mother is a complete housewife. My elder brother now lives in Canada. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother used to feed us my sister and me till we standard 4. My sister and my age difference are just 1.5 years. so she was just one class behind me. She was the closet out of my all siblings. I being sentimental stopped talking to little brother and younger sister. Even though I barely talked to them, we talked like with eyes. They never cast me out and I never felt any distance between us even though we haven&amp;#39;t talked for long. My mother used to be the medium between us.

I've (F 21) been struggling for a while now with the whole situation with my sister (23). We haven't gotten along well in years since I was probably 11 or 12. We have small moments when we get along briefly but for the most part not so much. While, I know that I have not always been the perfect sister, the way that she treats me and other people I just do not agree with.

&amp;#x200B;

Growing up, she was always the mean big sister to me and we didn't get along at all but things improved when she moved away and we didn't have to see each much anymore - in fact we went two years without seeing each other (we spoke on the phone occasionally) and it was the most peaceful two years of my life - family wise.  Two years ago she moved to the city where I'm studying at college and she couldn't find a place to live so I moved out of the residence hall so she would have a place to share with someone. Since then it has just been one big downwards spiral.

&amp;#x200B;

Since moving in together she has threatened to ruin my relationship with my parents during fights, told me I have a bad relationship with my boyfriend even though we are perfectly happy and functional, yelled at me for not spending time with her but then yelled at me for never having space and saying she hates living with me, she has said she hates me and she can't wait for me to be gone, she slept with a close friend of mine and then tried to hide it and claimed she felt so guilty when I found it but then continued to do it behind my back for another month until he told me after he called it off because she wasn't nice, she has kicked me out of the apartment when I have had major essays due and had her friends over or her boyfriend over, banished me to my room when she has had her boyfriend over, ate my food many times, told me my degree isn't hard, told me I can't do anything right etc. etc. you get the picture. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's to the point, where I don't even know if this is what siblings should be like anymore? I feel like it is all too much and living with her has really taken a toll on me emotionally. I am anxious to be in my own house and only go to the kitchen to cook food when she is gone. I hide in my bedroom at all times. I am anxious to interact with her and most of her interactions involve her yelling at me or pretending I don't exist and slamming doors.

&amp;#x200B;

I am moving out in a few months with my partner and I don't know if I should just cease all contact with her when I move out. I really want to because she has made me just miserable for years on end now. However, I don't want to hurt my parents or my brother in doing so. I have no interest in her as a person anymore though - we haven't had a single normal conversation in over two months. She only is nice to me when she wants something from me.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? Also, has anyone ever cut off a sibling and regretted it?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

this is the gist of it: my brother is in a relationship that will be two years along sometime this summer. about 4-5 months ago his girlfriend (28f) started this insane diet. she now eats only raw fruits and vegetables. when she started this diet she told my brother he HAD to be on it as well for the relationship to continue. this apparently caused a big fight that ended with her telling him to leave if he wasn’t going to follow it, and him calling my mother for a ride/help moving stuff. before that couod happen, they “worked it out”. apparently working it out to my brother means eating like she wants when they’re together and whatever else when they’re not. except they’re always together as he lives there and is currently an unemployed student. 

i’m a little concerned that the diet is anorexia. full disclaimer, she had gained some weight at the beginning of their relationship and was apparently having trouble losing it, so this is where the diet came from. she was also a very heavy drinker/pot smoker and quit cold turkey to be on this diet (no judgements as i smoke/drink too, i just find it strange that she can flip the switch so easily). i think my brother is going along with it. he was here the other day and refused most food except a small bowl of fajita mix/rice. i guess if he really wants to it’s nbd to me, what’s confusing me is he seemed understandably opposed at first but has not tried to go against it. i told him at the beginning i thought it was weird for her to control his diet. he agreed but said that going against it “caused problems”. he did not elaborate. it would be one thing if they were eating stuff of substance, but there was a picture on fb the other day of “dinner” and it was literally a bowl of clementine/orange slices. 

there was also a lot of weird signs from the beginning that i’m kind of starting to think about (i know, hindsight is 20/20) and it really feels that she was always very bossy and controlling.

so basically i’m not sure why i’m here except that i’m looking for advice. i honestly think this is some kind of abuse or emotional manipulation. i want to tell my brother that but he’s always been kind of independent and averse to authority so i don’t want to make him be like “no fuck off” and get more attached to her as a result.

I haven’t said all this out loud before and I just need somewhere to say it.

My dad  got food poisoning nearly two weeks ago and he had to go to the hospital and normally he should be out by now but he’s still in the hospital because he still doesn’t feel well and I’m very worried. I’m in college in a different country/continent and I can’t see him, I can’t even talk to him on the phone because every time I call my mom (she stays at the hospital with him), he’s either asleep or trying to sleep or too tired to talk. My mom tells me not to worry and that he’ll be fine and I’m sure he will be, but I can’t help but worry. I can’t stop crying and I don’t know what to do anymore. My dad and I didn’t have the greatest relationship when I was growing up simply because he worked a lot and I don’t resent him because I know he was doing it for us. He devoted his whole life to working hard just so he could give my sister and I the world, there is not a single thing we asked for that he didn’t give to us. He has never been very outwardly affectionate and for a while I felt like we didn’t have much of a relationship and I felt very shy around him, but one thing I’ve always been sure of is that I just really want to make him proud.

I visited home last Christmas after two years of being away at college and everything was so different. I could tell he wanted to be closer to me and my sister, he made more effort to talk to us and spend time with us, he doesn’t even like popcorn but he knows we do and he went out and got popcorn so we could all watch a movie together and he ate popcorn with us. He was trying and it made me so happy. But it broke my heart seeing him last Christmas because he was so thin; he lost a lot weight because he had become depressed and stopped eating. 

I have two brothers and he invested as much time in them, he did everything for them to make sure they could be successful; but they screwed up in college and ended up dropping out and essentially cut him (my dad) off after he stopped sending money to them simply because he had given them too many chances. One of them was out of college for a whole year but lied to my dad and continued collecting tuition money from him for that year. They said my dad was never there for them and I know my dad has his flaws, but he did it all just so we could live comfortably. They broke his heart and sent him into depression and he hasn’t been himself ever since. 

Now he’s in hospital- he’s been there for almost two weeks- and the thought of anything being wrong with him is breaking me. He’s been through so much pain already. I just want to make him proud and happy, I just want a chance to make him as happy as he has made me. I want him to know that my sister and I still love him and value him as a father, I just want to make him proud. I just need him to stay strong so I can make him proud. I’m working so hard in college so I can take care of him and give him the world too. I just need him to stay strong. I want to show him that all his hard work was not in vain. I love him so much, and the thought of not being able to show him this is tearing me apart. I need him to be okay again.

I finally did it. I am officially no longer in contact with anyone in my family. The only person I’m keeping in contact with is my full sister because we’ve been in the same boat and she’s always been supportive and understanding. 

But now I no longer have to speak or interacted with anyone else ever again. It was so hard to do because society makes you feel like an asshole for it. “But he’s your dad! But she’s your mom!” Who cares? They’re both terrible people. I’m 26F and I’m finally free. 

Anyway, I just want say that it is possible to remove people from you life. It’s hard and society will tell you otherwise, but once it’s done you’ll feel so much better and everyone else will pretty much drop it since the whole thing is over because people only want to be apart of the drama.

&lt;p&gt;I finally did it. I am officially no longer in contact with anyone in my family. The only person I’m keeping in contact with is my full sister because we’ve been in the same boat and she’s always been supportive and understanding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now I no longer have to speak or interacted with anyone else ever again. It was so hard to do because society makes you feel like an asshole for it. “But he’s your dad! But she’s your mom!” Who cares? They’re both terrible people. I’m 26F and I’m finally free. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I just want say that it is possible to remove people from you life. It’s hard and society will tell you otherwise, but once it’s done you’ll feel so much better and everyone else will pretty much drop it since the whole thing is over because people only want to be apart of the drama. &lt;/p&gt;

Nonetheless, while I was at this Christian rehab center, I got no help and my paranoia of others only increased. 
I had gotten caught writing erotic, sexual cohortion short story or something. The Christian counselor I had seen a year or two prior saw the red flags and recommended I see someone so I could get help. My dad rejected this help for me because he didn’t want “fake memories implanted in my head”. 

Looking back on that, there’s so much red flags. Like I’ve never liked to be touched, growing up older men scared me, and even as young as seven I had knowledge on areas to touch myself that I know I never should of.

One in Alabama and one in a program that offers three countries (India, Thailand and Liberia (Africa)). I told her I might choose Alabama since I was interviewed  there first. She then told me she will find a conference in Alabama too. 

But then this other program accepted me first. Now there's 3 countries. She asked on which one I want to go to. I told her I want to go India because I havent been there. She was extremely hesitant and keep scaring me of going there. I then told her, ""fine I""ll go to Africa instead. She's even more disappointed. Now Thailand is my only choice. I've been to Thailand and I know there were so many things I didn't see there yet (because I went there and I was with her then. And I go where she wants to go). 

Anyway, now she told me she will find a conference  in Thailand too. She found a conference and her other her reasons is because my brother havent been there. 

But my professor assigned me to Liberia. And I like it (it was my first choice anyway if my mom wasnt so hesitant). But it happened I was assigned there. My reason for liking Liberia is because the research was my interest and highly relevant to my future career of choice  (bioengineering). When she found out, she sounded a bit agitated and told me that it will be a waste of money for her to go to Thailand because she went there already. I told her, ""arent you going because my brother havent been there and also for your conference?"" 

I confronted her on why she always have to go where I go. She was in denial. Making me feel like Im stupid. 

She was always like this. Even when I wanted to move to Oregon, she wanted to give up her tenureship as a professor to move there with me.  Drag my dad along who also has a career himself in where we live now. And my brother who wants to stay and stidy his law degree. Even when I got in to MIT in Massachusetts. She sabotaged my scholarships and financial aids (im full ride) and made me go to the university that's horrible and this place I never wanna stayed in to anymore. 

Her reason is because I was a still a kid (Im 17 then). But Im 21 now. I  wanna have my own career,life choices and independence. She makes me feel scared to be independent.

I do understand why she's like that. When I was 15 to 18, I have suicide attempts and I have depression. And I also have a disability that requires me to always have a health insurance and so i rely to her to maintain my health insurance.  She have chronic anxiety disorder as well. 

But honestly, Ive been trying to study how to budget, finding insurance and investing for years (secretly). And my suicidal attempts, it's because I have no friends. I move in the US with a different culture (I was 10). In my origin of country I also grew up always jailed in my home after school. So i grew up shy and awkward. (I also grew up with a racist point of view). And moving to the US, social culture is extremely different. People are harder to connect to. So I further ended up becoming alone. 

Growing up as a teen (you know puberty and pressure). I was conflicted and thats when my depression started. My mom who controlls my life all throughout thinking im always vulnerable drives me crazy!!! I wanna leave or I wanna die.

Other people whom I shared this with. They said Im a smart kid. I can just leave. I told them, Im smart by not leaving or else I'll be dead. The state I live in, is the most expensive place to live by yourself. Its also hard to move away off this place because its isolated from other states. But Im suffering and I have no choice.... Its either life and death. 
I have no friends to live into. And I cant give up my only life which is science (but even here I cant study because I cant concentrate with her telling me this and that...)

And i cant leave because my mom will go hysterical and it might even be the cause of her death. I cant do that to her. 

Im not a bad kid,I love my mom.  I love my dad but theyre holding my life too much.  I dont know what to do anymore.

Plus, I know being an adult and independent is not easy especially with the type of economy we have now. But evetually Ill have to grow up and learn by myself. And leave the concept of friendship slump and expectations. Leave my childish attitude. But my life is holding me back.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I applied to a two research programs. One in Alabama and one in a program that offers three countries (India, Thailand and Liberia (Africa)). I told her I might choose Alabama since I was interviewed  there first. She then told me she will find a conference in Alabama too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then this other program accepted me first. Now there&amp;#39;s 3 countries. She asked on which one I want to go to. I told her I want to go India because I havent been there. She was extremely hesitant and keep scaring me of going there. I then told her, &amp;quot;fine I&amp;quot;ll go to Africa instead. She&amp;#39;s even more disappointed. Now Thailand is my only choice. I&amp;#39;ve been to Thailand and I know there were so many things I didn&amp;#39;t see there yet (because I went there and I was with her then. And I go where she wants to go). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, now she told me she will find a conference  in Thailand too. She found a conference and her other her reasons is because my brother havent been there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my professor assigned me to Liberia. And I like it (it was my first choice anyway if my mom wasnt so hesitant). But it happened I was assigned there. My reason for liking Liberia is because the research was my interest and highly relevant to my future career of choice  (bioengineering). When she found out, she sounded a bit agitated and told me that it will be a waste of money for her to go to Thailand because she went there already. I told her, &amp;quot;arent you going because my brother havent been there and also for your conference?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I confronted her on why she always have to go where I go. She was in denial. Making me feel like Im stupid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was always like this. Even when I wanted to move to Oregon, she wanted to give up her tenureship as a professor to move there with me.  Drag my dad along who also has a career himself in where we live now. And my brother who wants to stay and stidy his law degree. Even when I got in to MIT in Massachusetts. She sabotaged my scholarships and financial aids (im full ride) and made me go to the university that&amp;#39;s horrible and this place I never wanna stayed in to anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her reason is because I was a still a kid (Im 17 then). But Im 21 now. I  wanna have my own career,life choices and independence. She makes me feel scared to be independent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do understand why she&amp;#39;s like that. When I was 15 to 18, I have suicide attempts and I have depression. And I also have a disability that requires me to always have a health insurance and so i rely to her to maintain my health insurance.  She have chronic anxiety disorder as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But honestly, Ive been trying to study how to budget, finding insurance and investing for years (secretly). And my suicidal attempts, it&amp;#39;s because I have no friends.

We share everything with one another, and we would always have conversations throughout the day talking about whatever's currently going on in our lives. In terms of our education, he went to a top university in the UK, whereas I was pretty much on the opposite end and prolly going to a pretty mediocre one.

Anyway, I was having a discussion with him earlier on which universities I should try applying for, when he started saying things like 'you wouldn't get in anyway' for certain universities. This really ticked me off, and I really went off on him on how he (as a professional teacher and brother) shouldn't really be telling me words such as those, as to me it appeared as though he was putting me down. He started explaining himself, and we argued back and forth, with me raising my voice before he suddenly stopped himself. He then started tearing up, and then I got really worried as well. 
Ok this is some backstory that's relevant, 2 years before this, I managed to secure a really nice scholarship to a really nice school. However, because I failed ONE subject by ONE grade due to complacency, the whole scholarship was revoked. My family and I tried desperately to appeal for months, and all in all it was just a really tough period for my family. I would definitely say that the revocation derailed my educational pathway, and although I have recovered from it, I had to take an alternative, non-conventional route
So, the reason my brother started tearing up was because he really, really felt that I deserved that scholarship, and felt that it was really a damn fucking shame whatever happened happened. He explained that he's really hard on me now because he doesn't want me to get complacent and throw any good opportunities away, and to manage my expectations because we were all so utterly devastated when the revocation happened. He also admitted that sometimes even with my best interests, he can sometimes be too blunt, which can come across as putting me down.
Of course, I felt really guilty that I was taking such big shots at him, as had I known better and perhaps asked nicely, I would've understood the situation better. I've sincerely apologised to him, and he has as well, and for now we're back to normal. However I still feel a little guilty, and I'm not sure if I should say or do anything else.

No TL;DR because that would probably yield bad advice haha**

I am a 23-year-old male. Unfortunately, I have to live with my parents because of a series of incidents leaving me with nothing (car fire, neurological problems, leaving me without the ability to work, and unable to save except for a new car). My mom was diagnosed with BPD in the 80s, and although I have my doubts (I think their finger slipped when they meant to type N), I get that she has a personality disorder... and so she doesn't see reason.

I have a car now, and a job, and I'm trying to save money so I can move out, since living here is slowly making me more and more depressed.

I have to wake up at 3:30 AM to make it to work on time, so getting to bed early is a necessity. My mom is a very heavy-handed person when it comes to shutting doors, putting away dishes, etc. She also has a very loud step, much louder than her short stature and relatively-average weight should produce. Compounding this, sounds reverberate loudly in this house. 

The noises have prevented me from sleeping for months, and a few months into that I told her about it and asked if she might do a few things to lessen the noise (close doors gently, take off shoes, etc) but she got angry and claimed that those things didn't sound loud to her (mind you, she's practically slamming the doors), and said she just doesn't know how to be quieter. Bear in mind, she isn't a sweet old lady, but a spiteful woman whose personality disorder permeates all her closest relationships, including a lot of passive aggression, blaming, etc.

After maybe two months of pleading, all the while progressively losing any confidence that I could have a normal conversation with her about it (that wouldn't devolve into being told I was in the wrong, that it's just not reasonable to ask someone to make less noise when you're trying to sleep...), plus the compounded sleep deprivation making me more irritable and depressed (starting to have suicidal thoughts again, which I haven't in like a year and a half), she finally conceded it was reasonable to ask her to make less noise at night. 

However, in the mornings that I'm off, she works. She wears hard-soled shoes on hardwood floors while she's getting ready. I have asked her if she could put them on when she's heading out the door, but she flew into a rage again and said if I ever mention it again she's going to cut off my phone service. I can pay for my phone, and have offered to do so many times, so I don't know why she thinks this is logical. But the act of threatening to interfere with my life as a result of asking her to do a simple thing is just one of many examples like this. Over and over again, she has demonstrated this pattern of denying responsibility for how her actions affect others. As a child, I learned to apologize profusely and take everything on myself because if I so much as suggested she was doing something unfair, I would be yelled at and shamed. I digress.

Does anyone have any practical advice? I use earplugs, but I am extremely sensitive to noise, to the point that I can hear nearly everything that goes on in our **big** house, including conversations in the kitchen which is an entirely different wing of the house, and the earplugs do next to nothing (plus it's not really safe or hygienic to use earplugs every night, due to compacted earwax and risk of infection). Anyway, they fall out by the morning, and they offer no help with her noise.. but even less so in the relational problems this causes. 

I am going crazy here. Thank you so much for reading this, I know it was long and had a few rabbit trails... Thank you. If anyone has any practical advice, I will be very grateful. Thank you, again.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sorry this is long, but there&amp;#39;s a lot on my mind.

&lt;p&gt;The noises have prevented me from sleeping for months, and a few months into that I told her about it and asked if she might do a few things to lessen the noise (close doors gently, take off shoes, etc) but she got angry and claimed that those things didn&amp;#39;t sound loud to her (mind you, she&amp;#39;s practically slamming the doors), and said she just doesn&amp;#39;t know how to be quieter. Bear in mind, she isn&amp;#39;t a sweet old lady, but a spiteful woman whose personality disorder permeates all her closest relationships, including a lot of passive aggression, blaming, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After maybe two months of pleading, all the while progressively losing any confidence that I could have a normal conversation with her about it (that wouldn&amp;#39;t devolve into being told I was in the wrong, that it&amp;#39;s just not reasonable to ask someone to make less noise when you&amp;#39;re trying to sleep...), plus the compounded sleep deprivation making me more irritable and depressed (starting to have suicidal thoughts again, which I haven&amp;#39;t in like a year and a half), she finally conceded it was reasonable to ask her to make less noise at night. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in the mornings that I&amp;#39;m off, she works. She wears hard-soled shoes on hardwood floors while she&amp;#39;s getting ready. I have asked her if she could put them on when she&amp;#39;s heading out the door, but she flew into a rage again and said if I ever mention it again she&amp;#39;s going to cut off my phone service. I can pay for my phone, and have offered to do so many times, so I don&amp;#39;t know why she thinks this is logical. But the act of threatening to interfere with my life as a result of asking her to do a simple thing is just one of many examples like this. Over and over again, she has demonstrated this pattern of denying responsibility for how her actions affect others. As a child, I learned to apologize profusely and take everything on myself because if I so much as suggested she was doing something unfair, I would be yelled at and shamed. I digress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any practical advice? I use earplugs, but I am extremely sensitive to noise, to the point that I can hear nearly everything that goes on in our &lt;strong&gt;big&lt;/strong&gt; house, including conversations in the kitchen which is an entirely different wing of the house, and the earplugs do next to nothing (plus it&amp;#39;s not really safe or hygienic to use earplugs every night, due to compacted earwax and risk of infection). Anyway, they fall out by the morning, and they offer no help with her noise.. but even less so in the relational problems this causes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going crazy here. Thank you so much for reading this, I know it was long and had a few rabbit trails... Thank you. If anyone has any practical advice, I will be very grateful. Thank you, again.&lt;/p&gt;

My boyfriend's cousin Sam* had been with this girl Emma* for about 3 months prior to her falling pregnant. The family seemed to accept her straight away and she started attending family events immediately. She is often on our property and yet we have never been introduced and she blatantly ignores us when she sees us. Since her falling pregnant they have moved in to a house together opposite ours. 

We have tried talking to her and being friendly as they are having a baby and she is now apart of the family, but we are shut down every time, she does not make it easy to like her. Emma is from a wealthy family and has never had to work for anything she has. Often giving off the impression of a girl that gets her own way. She is very immature because of this and doesn't seem to grasp the amount of work raising a child is going to take. Since moving into their house they have yet to cook for themselves as she doesnt know how to cook. 

Since Sam has been with Emma he seems a completely different person, no longer the friendly face we were used to seeing at family events. He now is barely seen and when he is, he's always rushing off somewhere. 

This is not my thoughts or feelings but Sam's parents would be the type to be highly critical of a couple having a baby prior to marriage, especially a couple who had only known eachother a matter of months. I know for a fact if it had been my partner and I in the same situation we would have been heavily criticised, instead of celebrated and being the talk of all events on how great the pregnancy is.  

Im really at a loss on how to improve the situation and am aware I'm viewing this all in the negative I'm tired of feeling like there's a tension anytime the family is together. Any advice on how to fix the situation? Do I have a right to be annoyed here or am I making something out of nothing?

She kept on wanting me \[19M\] to go to work today and wanted me outside the house, which I felt was off. So I decided to have a look through it when she was asleep and I saw her texting a family friend \[50M\] weird things like “daddy” and “I’m on my period, not in the mood”. I was pretty shook. I decided to look through her search history and saw her searching for “sexy kissing” pics and “love” pics on google. I went through her recently deleted and unfortunately saw a pic of her in her underwear.

I confronted the family friend on WhatsApp before telling my mom first and basically told him to fuck off and don’t text my mom. I was able to see what they said to each other because I opened WhatsApp web last night and could basically see their chats. I saw him text her that they “had a big problem” and that I know everything.

Now when I confronted my mom she kept on denying it. She said that I saw it in a wrong way (what other way is there to see “daddy”?) and that she was planning a summer visit to India with him and planning on how to pay for it to surprise my dad. They both kept on denying it. She kept on saying why would I cheat now in my 50s (mind you my dad is outside the country).

Now I’m really stuck in crossroads. Is she actually cheating? Or am I seeing this the wrong way?

also, should I tell my dad? I’m scared of the possible outcomes: 1) he sees it the way my mom sees it and I lose the good relationship I have with him. 2) he sees the way I see it, and that break apart my family (we’re expats in Dubai, that makes things much worse). I’m scared he’d do something stupid and get hurt.

We've stopped arguing now but she keeps asking me to delete the chats I have of them. If she hasn’t done anything wrong, and isn’t scared that I tell my dad, why does she keep insisting that I delete the chats?

Tl;dr: I think my mom is cheating on my dad because I saw her texting sexual stuff to a family friend.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, so backstory: last night I saw pretty suspicious behaviour from my mom [47F] on her phone. She kept on wanting me [19M] to go to work today and wanted me outside the house, which I felt was off. So I decided to have a look through it when she was asleep and I saw her texting a family friend [50M] weird things like “daddy” and “I’m on my period, not in the mood”. I was pretty shook. I decided to look through her search history and saw her searching for “sexy kissing” pics and “love” pics on google. I went through her recently deleted and unfortunately saw a pic of her in her underwear.&lt;/p&gt;

We have two pet dogs and one requires 2 x tablet a day (one in morning and one in night) for her nervousness - these tablets are mainly to calm her down as she gets a bit anxious.

When my parents were last away I was given the responsibility of basically doing everything from cleaning, looking after the dogs (feeding, walking, medicating, cleaning), looking after the guinea pigs (feeding, letting out for a run, cleaning), cleaning the kitchen and doing the dishes, watering the grass, watering and giving fertiliser to our plants, cleaning bathrooms ect - you name it. I was more than happy to do all this, it was not a problem. The problem that occurred was that my brother would keep the anxious dog in his room over night, and would not come out of his room (with her) until late morning or even noon - I leave the house at 7am every morning. My mum made it clear that the anxious dog needs to have her medication at the same time every morning and night. So I would have to try and text and call to ask him to let the dog out of his room so I can give her the meds etc - his door has a lock so I cannot go in. Essentially I ended up ringing my mum asking what I should do since I can't get access to the dog in the morning to give her the meds which ended up in her screaming down the phone at me saying I have completely ruined her holiday.

&amp;#x200B;

So now they are going away again I have asked my parents if they could speak to my brother for me (we are not close and he gets very angry quite easily) and ask him if he is able to either keep the medication in his room so he can give it to the dog in the morning, since she sleeps in there, so I don't have to worry about texting or calling in the morning to let the dog out or he just stops the dog from sleeping in there over night. I thought that this issue was sorted but now my mum is having a go at me saying she doesn't want any calls ruining her holiday this time because I haven't given the dog her meds. I explained that I thought my brother was now in charge of this small task of giving the dog her meds in the morning (especially since he doesn't do anything else), but apparently not - he even got mad at the dinner table and told me he doesn't want me annoying him in the morning with texts to let her out. So I basically have no idea if he is going to stop her from sleeping in his room or if he is going to give her the meds himself in the morning?

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially my bottom line question is - what do I do if he refuses to keep the medication in his room (so I have to give it to her) and refuses to stop the dog from sleeping in his room (so I cannot access the dog)? Mum has had about 5 arguments already with me saying I am causing her a lot of stress and she's losing sleep because she is worrying about the dogs, but she is causing me a hell of a lot of stress because I know if I am not able to give the dog her medication I will be buried alive. Baring in mind I have already had a massive falling out with her in the past about how she favours my brother over everyone else; I don't understand why she cannot just say to him 'you are in charge of giving the dog her medication in the morning'.

When I was 8, we had guests over. And I had this terrible 'habit' of not knowing what to say or what not to say in front of guests. For example, this one time when there were tons of kids and their parents over, one of the parents asked me if I wanted a macaron. As a child, I didn't know what everything was named. I knew macarons, just didn't know they were called 'macarons' so when I was asked that question in front of everyone, I said ""What's that?""

When I reached home, my mom bitched to my dad, sister and cousin (who lived with us at the time) in front of me about how I embarrassed her, by making it seem like my mom doesn't feed her any macarons, since I acted like I didn't know what those were. You can only imagine, I started hating social situations always. I got increasingly quiet with guests and hated having anyone over because I developed this anxiety that I will never know what to say or what not to say.

Then, we had another family over and I was proud at that age that I finally overcame this fear and now I could put my guard down- relax in front of guests and not shiver everytime I was asked a question. I was 8. I loved the way the term 'boooooo' sounded (the kind you yell in a theatre if the movie was bad) and I would hum it all day around the house as a child, a very childish thing to do. This one time when guests were over I fell sick, and apparently, the guests' kid was also sick. He was 6 or something. So they asked if they could lay him in bed for a while. So they chose my bed and lay him beside me (I have a big bed). So I was just humming 'boo' as I always did and apparently the next day my mom tells me that when they were having breakfast all together (while I was still sleeping) the little kid asked if I was retarded or autistic or had an issue and my mom was talking about how embarrassed she was and how I embarrassed the entire family that even a 6 year old asked if I was retarded. At the time I obliged and never said that again, but you can predict how this had a major hit on my self esteem, even being able to interact socially and how I saw myself. I remembered all this even when I grew up, because it hurt me so much.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to when I was 15, we were looking for a boarding school to send me because I didn't want to stay at the school I was in and wanted to move out, basically, for the last two years of high school. One day when I return home, my sister tells me ""We've found you the boarding school that will be best for you, XYZ"" and I ended up going there.

The curriculum was very bad and because of my self esteem issues I constantly got bullied there to the point where I was suicidal. My mom said, ""Well, it was your decision to go to XYZ boarding school anyway,"" and that's when I snapped and said, ""I never said I wanted to go there, \[sister's name\] suggested it"" she would shake her head in denial and say ""why would we suggest such an expensive boarding school unless you begged for us to let you go there?""

And she would stay so stubborn about it, that she just wouldn't believe that I never suggested it. Till date. I'm 19 now.

Fastforward to when I was 16 and applying for Universities, I wanted to pursue a medical degree but my parents though getting an undergrad degree in biology without an MD is useless, so I should take something more useful instead. I remember distinctly them walking into my room when I was 16 and giving me a while explanation to convince me why I should choose Computer Science, mind you, I don't know a single thing about CS.

My parents convinced me that my cousins who live near my University did it as well, and they could teach me in case I had any issues. So I listened to them, and then I ended up failing all my classes because I didn't know the ABC of computer science. My cousins said it was too hard for them to understand. And I was stuck. Now I'm trying to transfer and my mom said to me today ""it was your decision to choose computer science anyway, even though i told you to choose medicine"" and I had my share of it today, and finally said ""It was you, who walked into my room and lectured me about taking computer science back in 2016,"" and she said ""that never happened, when did I do this?""

Then I cried about all that I suffered as a child when she constantly blamed me for being an embarrassment to the family and how I was disappointed in her when a random 6 year old 'guest' had the audacity to ask my parents in my house if I was retarded, why did she not defend me? why did she hold me accountable and not him? I was 8. And she said: ""When did this happen? This never happened, stop blaming me for things that never happened""

&amp;#x200B;

Mind you, she remembers every detail of how I hit her when I was 4, or how she went looking for 'glass slippers' in the market when i was cinderella for a play at school, she remembers things. She just denies and 'forgets' things she did wrong to. I just wished I could sit and talk to my parents normally, everytime my mom is in her room doing nothing I would stroll in wanting to sit and hang out with her, so I'd walk in and cuddle with my mom trying to form some sort of a bond, and right then when she'd hug me back she'd mention that one most stressful thing that's bothering me at that point in life, ""remember that test you studied all night for and weren't sure how that went- have the marks returned?"" or when i was 15 and I'd go to her to hug and cuddle for a bit, she'd be like ""wish you were always like this, and started focusing a bit on your academics and hung out with our paternal side of the family more instead of being in your room all the time.."" like I'm sorry but I'm trying to bond with you here, if I were to tell you every little thing I'd change about you, you'd say ""when did i ever do that in the first place"" but i don't understand how hard it is to stay happy and to look after another person by not constantly pickering them, maybe admitting your mistakes once in a while.

My mom though isn't a psychopath, I know she loves me, she wouldn't let me do the dishes because she doesn't want my palms to get 'brushed off' or 'rough', she'd constantly make me food and look after me, but in terms of our bond, i hate the way she is to me. Whenever I shared this with my sister, my sister would say ""she's your mom she's not supposed to apologise to you, you can't hold her accountable for stuff like this"" or ""all parents are like this"" Are they, really?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR!: my mom would treat me like trash and then deny it ever happened","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mom is very stubborn. She does things that have hurt me in the past and whenever I bring it up, she plays the &amp;quot;When did I even do/say this?&amp;quot; card. When I am, 100% sure, it has happened. She does not have any medical condition, because she remembers everything perfectly, she remembers every single thing I&amp;#39;ve done wrong/said, but she does not remember anything she has done to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was 8, we had guests over. And I had this terrible &amp;#39;habit&amp;#39; of not knowing what to say or what not to say in front of guests. For example, this one time when there were tons of kids and their parents over, one of the parents asked me if I wanted a macaron. As a child, I didn&amp;#39;t know what everything was named. I knew macarons, just didn&amp;#39;t know they were called &amp;#39;macarons&amp;#39; so when I was asked that question in front of everyone, I said &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I reached home, my mom bitched to my dad, sister and cousin (who lived with us at the time) in front of me about how I embarrassed her, by making it seem like my mom doesn&amp;#39;t feed her any macarons, since I acted like I didn&amp;#39;t know what those were.

Flash forward 20 years.

I am now married and living in America with 2 children

Now my father is dead and my step sister is in her 20s.

I want my children to have a relation with their aunt (my half-sister) on my fathers side,

and it ruined my life.

So I invited her to stay with my family (my wife and 2 kids) next winter.

She will be able to help out too with my kids, as raising kids is hard.

However my mother and my half-sister in England found out about this,

""It'll go bad before she gets around to it. Let me take care of it.""

""You can just make another one before she gets here. Let me finish off the last slice.""

I said no to each and everyone of those knuckle-scraping oafs. And I've been nice about it, too. They've had their fair share. Let me give this last slice to my lady-friend.

Well, you probably think you know where this is going. 'They ate it. What's the big deal? You should have been expecting it.' That's not the case, my friends.

Apparently what went through their mind is ""If I can't have it, nobody can."" 

THOSE FUCKERS SMASHED IT BEYOND RECOGNITION.

I'm not saying they just tipped over the pudding or some shit. YOU CANNOT TELL CRUST FROM PUDDING. It is mangled. Completely and utterly inedible. And when I presented it to them, questioning who was responsible, do you know what those jar-headed twat-munchers did?

THEY LAUGHED. They were in HYSTERICS. 

""You should see the look on your face!""

""Somebody get a camera!""

""Funny shit!""

No! Not funny! Disrespectful to the highest cocking degree. I spent three fucking days making the damn thing, and they smash it to pieces just so the girl I've got some light feelings for doesn't get to try? In who's right mind is that funny?

I sure as shit have. It was amazing. A firm, yet crumbly pie crust (with just a smidge of lemon zest) combined with an egg yolk/whipped cream/poppy seed pudding filling, and chilled to the perfect temperature where the pudding holds its shape, but still feels like pudding. To. Die. For.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shared it with my family, and they all agreed: it was heavenly. Now, I only got a small slice of my creation; those animals ate the rest of it within a day. That&amp;#39;s not what I&amp;#39;m mad about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, what I did is I cut out a slice and set it aside, to save for this girl that is starting to like me.

I’ll keep this short but I’m not sure what to do with my mom who keeps saying negative things about my boyfriend

1. She always asks me how come we don’t do certain things in public and then she’s like “oh if that was my boyfriend I would be all over him...xyz.” But she doesn’t understand that I’m very self conscious about PDA and things like that. My boyfriend knows and understands that fully and honestly we do share moments of PDA but we don’t feel the need to brand our relationship to the world 24/7. We’re happy.

2. On Valentine’s Day she asked me where he took me to dinner. I told her and she said “oh why would you go there? You should’ve made him take you to a fancy place like xyz.” In reality, my bf asked me where I wanted to go and we went to the restaurant that I WANTED to go to. 

3. My mom thinks that just because my bf makes way more money than I do that he should shower me in lavish gifts. She always says “why don’t you ask him to buy you xyz?” Or she’ll make a comment like “you know he can afford xyz.” As if that means that I should just take advantage of him. Dont get me wrong, he spoils me and I’m grateful but I’m not the type of girl that likes lavish things and honestly I would never ask him to get me something fancy just because he can afford it. He wanted to get me an expensive gift for Xmas and I told him it was too much (plus we were new in the relationship) so my mom found out and said “WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? If you start denying gifts from him now he will stop giving them to you and gifts show how much he loves you.” It really bothered me because I’m not materialistic. 


4. This week she said my boyfriend was ugly. She said and I quote “he has a monkey face.” This just really hurt me because I find him attractive and I love him. I didn’t even argue with her about it because I didn’t have the energy and I wanted to avoid an awkward conversation. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi...

&amp;#x200B;

so the short version, the wife and i just returned from a holiday (prior to us leaving my sister had quit the family shop) and we seen that my sister had posted on FB that she was selling all of her stuff, i messaged her out of curiosty and she organised a meet up. when we met she basiclly said she viewed our parents as selfish arseholes who have constantly messed with her and shes not talked to them for 3 weeks, changed her name and in about 3 weeks is leaving town and moving away breaking all communication. this is also including aunts, uncles, cousins and grandparents and she claims she has no emotion towards anyone in the family.

&amp;#x200B;

as for me i havent personally liked her for the last 10 years since i was 16 (she is 2 years younger then me) as  she has always been self centered and lazy, the only time i hear from her is if she wants a place to crash for free when in the town, at family gatherings all she does is complaion about people.

&amp;#x200B;

over what she told me. what i know of everything thats happened and what i remember from us as kids and that i feel shes being really self centered and refuses to see that they have tried to help and do stuff for her her entire life. theres a lot too it all and i could be here for days typing it out but its not really about a whos right and wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

so onto what do i do, i know shes in town untill easter as she said shes got a weekend in a hotel so i have a few weeks of this info before it happens so im pretty annoyed now as all the options i see are shit tastic and really she could of told me as she left.

&amp;#x200B;

im not sure if i tell my parents so they have a chance to say goodbye not that i think she will listen or care as she seems pretty set on they have ruined my life and wont listen. but if i tell them she will not talk to me again (i have no idea why she seems to talk to me anyway) which means they will lose any potential way of knowing if shes ok ect. (there is a half sister she talks to but i dont know if she will tell us if shes ok)

&amp;#x200B;

i dont say anything, parents get cut deep, dad will probs be a shes dead to me but mum im worried about will be super cut, but i can then keep jher in contact and let them know shes still ok ect

&amp;#x200B;

im not entirley sure what the best option is, i feel like letting them know shes ok is the best option as much as i want to tell her shes a selfish cunt i thnik biting my tongue is the best course.

also has anyone been through this where a family member has ghosted, what would you have prefered to have had happen.

My mam fell pregnant and decided with my dad to keep it secret from his family. 

&amp;#x200B;

My life went on and I managed to have some sort of relationship with my dad. We would meet up every few months but he wasn't an active part in my life. He then had his own family, and had a little boy that I never met. I used to buy him presents each Christmas and send them down to my dad but it was only as I got older that I realized that my brother didn't know about me and either did the rest of my family.

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn't that close to my dad so I was never comfortable confronting him about it, but I asked my mam so many times if she could speak with my dad and she said that it might break up their family if my brother knew about me. So I left it, but I was heartbroken.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today. My brother is 18 years old. My dad asked to meet me, only to tell me that my brother found a photo of me belonging to my dad and my dad had to confess to him and that he wants to meet me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am over the moon, probably burying some kind of resentment towards my mam and dad about it, but still over the moon that my 18 year old little brother wants to meet me. He reached out to me on Facebook and it was awkward but he said he always wanted a big sister. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I am meeting him on Sunday and I don't know how to behave, what to say, what not to say, as apart of me feels guilty because I never pushed my dad to tell him about me, I don't know what information to give him as he is still pretty young, I don't want to upset him or make him feel uncomfortable.

&lt;p&gt;I am over the moon, probably burying some kind of resentment towards my mam and dad about it, but still over the moon that my 18 year old little brother wants to meet me. He reached out to me on Facebook and it was awkward but he said he always wanted a big sister. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I am meeting him on Sunday and I don&amp;#39;t know how to behave, what to say, what not to say, as apart of me feels guilty because I never pushed my dad to tell him about me, I don&amp;#39;t know what information to give him as he is still pretty young, I don&amp;#39;t want to upset him or make him feel uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice anyone has is massively appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;

I went to university in another town for 1 and a half years and found myself coming home to heinous abuse from my mum and brothers; targeted name calling and insults i.e being told to kill myself and that I am mental (I have diagnosed depression and attempted suicide at 16 which they know about) physical threats and being assaulted, destruction of my possessions in front of me, constant mocking and put-downs for my career choices and passions and so on.

I had to leave home and find my own place after calling the police on my mother for lashing out at me for the last time, and since this has happened (three months ago), I have wanted to cut all ties and relationships with her as I found the constant torrent of abuse unacceptable. However she constantly wants to talk to me and see if everything is okay; not to say sorry (which she has never done of her own accord) but just to rid herself of guilt for her own benefit and not mine, acting as if nothing ever happened.

Here's my issue. It is not as simple as getting rid of her completely as the abuse is not constant. When I am not being verbally and physically attacked, she has been a great mother and has brought me up very well under extremely tough circumstances (poverty, shitty partners etc.) and my emotions always want me to sort everything due to the good times and me not being an abusive dickhead. But I simply don't want anything to do with her due to all the abuse, and I know if I go back then it is guaranteed that it will kick off again. I have a fragile mind due to the aforementioned mental illness and getting thrown suddenly in the ""real world"" not of my own volition.

How do I create a great deal of space from her without completely removing her from my life? How do I create the space from her I need to heal and come to terms with her actions without losing all contact with her?

I was born out of the relationship of a married, old, wealthy guy (wealthy in terms of a low income country, not of US terms) with a teenager girl that worked for him. He did not financially support my mother and me. Neither recognized me as his son. He died before I was older enough to understand my whole situation and contact him. He went bankrupt during my childhood. Also, he suffered for several years before passing away. In a way this makes to think that because of this, he did not support my mother and me.

It was painful growing up and seeing others with a family structure that I desired to have.  My mother met another man, but he was around a few years, got her pregnant twice and then, he disappear with a younger woman.

I am from a developing country with a huge inequality. In my situation, this is translated as growing up in a slum filled with poverty and crime. I almost grew up by myself taking care of my siblings while my mom was working until late at an assembly line company. With my profile, I was the perfect candidate to become a gang member.

In my situation, knowing early on that there is a God that takes care of His children gave me a lot of hope and consider Him as my Father in heaven. You may or may not believe in any deity, but when you grew up like me, your beliefs are a bedrock to stand up and fight everyday for a better future.  With all my economic and emotional difficulties, I did my best in school to learn as much as possible because I realized early on that education is the best and most honest recipe to improve one's life.

The corrupt government of my country denied me several scholarships for college because I did not know the right people. However, God had something better. After graduating from high school, I worked for several years earning a minimum salary that I used mainly to pay English classes and help my mom. No girlfriend, party etc. because I could not do it with the little time and money that I had. During this time, I reached my biological father's family. I talked to what would be a niece and nephew, who were in the same age range as me (my biological father was quite old when he got my mother pregnant). We remained in contact in Facebook, but there seemed to be not that much interest in this family to meet me. This was in 2006 when I was a teenager.

After my efforts and lots of rejections of scholarships, God blessed me with a great one that allowed me to study my bachelors in US. Imagine, me a kid with no father, single mother, from the fringes of society and being the first ever to go to university in my family and doing it in the US! 

I did all my best at college. I attended every lecture. I lived in the library. I became active member of good student societies. This was the best opportunity that I had had so far and I was not going to waste it. At the end of the 4 years, I graduated summa cum laude with two bachelors and a minor. I was crying with joy and gratefulness when I approach the podium to receive my diploma. I cried because of all the effort to be there, because how great God is, because me coming from the very bottom in my country was there graduating from a bachelors in US!

After graduating, I went to work in consulting in a middle income country (my country of birth is a low income country). After several years of work, and several rejections of scholarships, God blessed me with a scholarship to study a master at a top European university (within top 20 of the world). So, I had to go to my country of birth to do some paperwork. It is during this time that my biological father's family, specifically a sister who has my mother age, got in contact with me because she wanted to know me. We met. I taught her my life story. I gathered that my niece had showed her my Facebook and they went through it. My sister told me that she was proud of me. She even invited me to my niece's wedding this year. After this meeting, all of my other siblings added me to Facebook, including other nieces.

My sister was very warm and seemed regretful of not meeting me before. She called me her little brother. We were very emotional around each other. She even gave me some sweaters as a gift before leaving my country. She has been keeping in touch with me, asking about how I am doing and caring for me.  Sharing photos about my family and telling me stories about them. She seems to desire to introduce me to the rest of the family during my niece's wedding because my sister has been asking me if I am going to go.

In one way, I am happy because of the connection and getting to know more about my father and his family (despite how I came to this world, God may have already judge my father). On the other hand, I do not want to be cynical with the situation, but I am thinking that why they contacted me now that I am doing good. After 12 years that I contacted them (2006), now they want to know about me. I have heard from other people that my nieces, from the sister that I met, are very classiest. I do not want to think that before they saw me beneath them and now that I am doing good they see me at their level and worthy to be part of their family.

&lt;p&gt;Especially my dad, he has never actually put any effort into getting a job. EVER. The first job he got was given to him because that&amp;#39;s how the Chinese government worked. All the other jobs are from my mom asking other people to give him the job. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom is a little bit better at understanding me, but she doesn&amp;#39;t seem to understand that I can&amp;#39;t get a job just because I really want to. And my social skills are not as good as hers. So I am better off applying for a job, going to interviews, and wait for a job offer. She told me to get a boyfriend and make him help me, but that sounds ridiculous too. Because this is a bad reason to get a boyfriend and I also can&amp;#39;t get a boyfriend just because I want to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what are my best job choices for getting a job? To recap it has to be a job where I can talk to other people and it has to have a good working hour (no overnight jobs). &lt;/p&gt;

Without going into details, my father lost unsupervised visitation rights (he didn't do anything but refused to do something about something being done by one of his step-sons), and my Grandparents jacked custody of me from my mother. This is where the trouble began.  


Grandmother has always been emotionally dismissive and physically abusive. Grandfather stepped in when it got physical, but he was part of the emotional abuse. One of their favorite things to ask was ""what the hell is your problem?!"", even after a diagnosis of high functioning autism by doctors. My response was, of course, ""Look in a mirror"" or ""The way you treat me"". Anytime I had logic and facts on my side, they didn't like it, and would instead refuse to carry on the conversation. When I threatened to call CPS, they said that I'd ""go to a family that didn't love me"".   


Even now, being poor and disabled, I'm reliant upon them for laundry at least once a month, usually twice.  


And every time I visit, it's a huge fight.  One stemmed from the Monty Hall Problem, crazy I know, but I brought it up because my grandfather likes to be an intellectual as well. Instead of listening, however, he declared me wrong. He then proceeded to yell at me for proposing an experiment to prove who was right. But that's not the crazy part. Months later, it just so happened to show up in a Bridge magazine (he likes that card game), and he tried to show it to me like it was some new concept to me. He believed a magazine over his own grandchild.  


When I merely try to bring facts into any conversation or debate, he says ""Yeah, Yeah, you're always right"" in this sarcastic and dismissive tone (even though I've NEVER claimed that, quite the opposite in fact)....

It may also help me clarify things in my mind.

I am an only child, born 50+ years ago. My father (British RAF) met my mother in Europe and brought her back to the UK as a souvenir after the war. Neither could speak the other's language, but they communicated via letters and French/English dictionaries. They married and set up a home in SE England, much to the initial disapproval of my English grandparents. Part of their disapproval may have been because Dad had had 'an arrangement' with a local girl, who he basically dumped for this foreign tart. However, Mum persevered, and enjoyed a standard of living much higher than she had ever known, having been brought up by a widow with two small children in an attic flat with no running water.

We always joked that Mum had had a plan to meet, seduce, and marry the first Brit she found, to escape to a better life. She tacitly accepted the accusation stoically, as it was very likely true. In any event, it became clear that my parents were very different people. Dad worked shifts, and in his spare time, worked on his allotment. He was unconcerned about his appearance and ambivalent about social activities. Mum loved entertainment: hosting parties, dancing at the local dance hall, visiting the big city. She was always very well turned out and conscious of her social position and 'what people would think'. To make matters worse, Mum was significantly more intellectual than Dad. The marriage therefore appears to have been a contract of convenience rather than one of love.

More than 15 years later, I arrived. Mum was not happy: in her own words, her partying had to end and, to make matters worse, I was a boy! Dad didn't change his routine, and left his housewife to raise the child. Don't get me wrong: he was always kind to me; I just didn't see him very often. I was raised harshly by Mum, but taught by my 'uncle': a family friend who had met Dad down the allotments. This lovely man helped me with my homework, taught me to ride a bike, debated with me during my awkward teenage years, and was the voice of reason during my many fights with Mum.

Fast-forward to now: Mum died more than a year ago; my two 'fathers' more than a decade earlier. I have a wife and several non-dependent children. My wife is into ancestry research, and she and my daughter decided to take a DNA test. Because of what they discovered, I took one too. The results? My biological father wasn't Dad. It wasn't my 'uncle' either (damnit). An unknown Acadian from Eastern Canada is the culprit.

I telephoned the only living friend of Mum, who used to live with her husband in the flat above my parents. I asked her if she knew the Acadian, using his name. She admitted that Mum had had an affair with him, which had continued for some years after my birth, partly facilitated by Mum's friend (who looked after me whilst they were ... involved). The man had died around 10 years before, having previously returned to Canada with a new wife 30+ years ago. Dad had not been aware of my parentage, but given my memories of family politics when I was young, I'm sure others had their suspicions.

I also have a very vague memory of a strange man, taking Mum and me to the beach when I was around 5, and giving me a fireman's hat. That was him.

So, there you go. My father's family aren't mine; I have an unknown wider family living in NE North America; I am, however, apparently still an only child. The people that brought me up haven't changed, almost everyone involved at the time is dead, and therefore this whole scenario is merely a cause for interest rather than debate or regret. I hope to visit East Canada in the not-too-distant future, perhaps to find someone who knew my father and could tell me what he was like.

I would love to talk to others in the same position as me: how do you feel about your parentage? Do you wish your parents had told you the truth before it was too late? What have you done in relation to your 'new' family? I'm still working out my own answers to these questions.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I just fancied telling this story and, although it won&amp;#39;t be an even slightly unusual one, I thought it might prove interesting.

Thank you for reading my post. Basically, the situation is that I need to get a job so I can save up money to move out. My family is toxic, very controlling, and possibly emotionally abusive. I need to leave for my own safety and mental health.

But my parents want me to stay home and watch my little brother and our chickens. Mom and Dad work most days of the week, and a lot of the chores fall on me (Cleaning the chicken coop, doing laundry, making dinner, etc). My little brother is thirteen, legally he can be left alone at home for a few hours, but Mom says he doesn't want that. I plan to ask him and see if that's what he actually thinks or if that was just Mom speaking for him.

The problem is that if I move out, all those chores are either not going to get done, or they're going to get foisted onto my brother. I can easily imagine him becoming stressed out. It's not improbable that they could figure something out and lighten the load, but I can sooner see them letting my little brother deal with it than trying to change anything. But I really don't want to put my own life on hold. I really think that I'm reaching my breaking point and I need to leave as soon as possible. It almost feels like my parents are trying to remove any possible exit for me and keep me stuck here as long as they possibly can.

I have until May - when I get my level 2 driver's license, and when I turn 18 - to figure something out. Do I stay at home for my family's sake, or should I try to get a job? I really need all the money I can get, and I'd be willing to do whatever it takes to get out of here.

I brought it up to my mom today and the second I mentioned the clothes she yells to my sister ""OMG can you get the clothes or at least find out if your friend got rid of them so your sister can move on with her life?!"" So privately I told my mom ""whenever there is in an issue you tell us to come to you to handle it so that us sisters don't fight. I feel that when I came to you with my issue you responded by making me the problem and I feel the message that came across to my sister was you were just as annoyed and did not care so why should she care"" Needless to say, my mom flipped out and it started a huge fight.  


But my sister (who was 15 ATM) was never punished for getting rid of my stuff or losing/breaking them. No one has offered repayment. And it continues being dismissed. This was expensive jewelry. Including my great-grandmother's diamond ring. And the clothes varied from cheap to pretty expensive as well. My stepdad immediately defends my sister as well. I feel like they aren't teaching her responsibility but I don't know what else to do! There's no talking to them.

Story over but short background story.  
Once someone broke into my school locker and stole fundraising money. My mom and stepdad didn't believe me and thought I stole it for myself (even though I was a honest to God good kid and couldn't even if I tried and I was 11 then).

My parents told me to get over it..... My sister told me the name of one of her friends who had the most expense of my clothes and I asked her to tell her friend to return it. Every few months I would remind her. Nothing. I&amp;#39;ve only brought it up to my mom a few times. 1st when it happened, about 5 months later, and again a few weeks ago marking 10 months of not having my things returned. My mom went to my sister and said &amp;quot;give her her clothes so I can stop hearing about it.&amp;quot; Still no clothes. I brought it up to my mom today and the second I mentioned the clothes she yells to my sister &amp;quot;OMG can you get the clothes or at least find out if your friend got rid of them so your sister can move on with her life?!&amp;quot; So privately I told my mom &amp;quot;whenever there is in an issue you tell us to come to you to handle it so that us sisters don&amp;#39;t fight. I feel that when I came to you with my issue you responded by making me the problem and I feel the message that came across to my sister was you were just as annoyed and did not care so why should she care&amp;quot; Needless to say, my mom flipped out and it started a huge fight.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my sister (who was 15 ATM) was never punished for getting rid of my stuff or losing/breaking them. No one has offered repayment. And it continues being dismissed. This was expensive jewelry. Including my great-grandmother&amp;#39;s diamond ring. And the clothes varied from cheap to pretty expensive as well. My stepdad immediately defends my sister as well. I feel like they aren&amp;#39;t teaching her responsibility but I don&amp;#39;t know what else to do! There&amp;#39;s no talking to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Story over but short background story.&lt;br/&gt;
Once someone broke into my school locker and stole fundraising money. My mom and stepdad didn&amp;#39;t believe me and thought I stole it for myself (even though I was a honest to God good kid and couldn&amp;#39;t even if I tried and I was 11 then). I was punished and questioned (interrogated) for HOURS to admit I kept the money. Room and clothes searched. Grounded anyways. So I really don&amp;#39;t understand how they went from that to this.&lt;/p&gt;

Extra info:

Sister is 21yrs old. Has always been lazy, kinda dopey, outgoing, social, bubbly. Bad breakup at 19. Started smoking, clubbing drinking, worrying about having a new penis, etc. My mom and I have tried to talk to her since she was 18 that she needs to start working towards being responsible, helpful, etc. and she has the freedom to do more things, but has to mature in some aspects.

I don't expect her to stop smoking, drinking, partying, sexing, or turning into a maid. I just wish she'd be smart about it and considerate. I want her to have fun! It's part of her personality and at her age she should. But the recklessness and  selfish antics are too much.

Our mom is always crying, worrying, scared, sad, angry, lonely and is now busting out in hives all over.

Our father died of alcoholism so that's a sore spot for our mom.

I'm 31yrs old and moved to TX a year ago. I don't know what I can do, but I'm tired of my mom suffering.

I've tried talking to her but she dodges questions, ignores them, or gives simple answers.

Sister sometimes posts that she has anxiety and can't do normal everyday things. Is this legit?

How should I go about things if I consider that? Hardass or kind sister? Idk what to do.

He’s also mentally abused by our late grandmother, she scolds him for everything he does even eating, and maybe that’s why he takes everything so personally.

Just an hour ago, I got into an argument with my mother today. Today I went to my school today to turn in important documents and attend my doctors appointment. I asked my boyfriend if he can tag along for Carpooling and support. 

After I dropped him off at his house, I went back home. I come to my kitchen and see my mother, father, and older sister  eating. As I sat down to eat at the table. My mother asked how was my day and what did I do. I told her it was tiring (traffic was everywhere in my region, and my school is about an 1hr away). As I told her I turned in my documents and to the doctors appointment. My mother asked why I went to the doctor's. 

I told her my reason was for a check up/physical just to see if theres no irregularities in my body for I been feeling sick at times. Only for my mom to argue that my hair is messy, and said that I went to my boyfriend house and stayed over there. (She never allows my sisters or me visit our boyfriends house due to her morals unless it was an event going along).

 Thus, leading to an argument between my parents where my mother is blaming my father for manipulating me to see her as a bad guy and my father as a victim. (Every fight in my life ended up with blaming my father for being the creator of this mess, and apparently we, her children don't have a decision or mind of our own are following whatever he says). I don't think I'm being manipulated, I just see things from both ways to hold each side with skepticism and decide what I believe they are right and wrong. (At times I'm treated as a therapist/stress doll for the both of them and usually I do is listen but not speak for I dont want to play as the judge to listen and determine who is right and wrong).  

All in all it ended with me being accused of lying that I went to the doctors. As I tried to stand my ground to assert that I did went to the doctors (my pitch when too aggressive). My mother went up to my face to ask, ""do I really want to keep that talkback/attitude (TBH I couldn't understand what she said for she was speaking in her a foreign language)towards her?"" 

Ended up with her threatening and asking  me that if i wanted her to slap my face and that she didnt care if I called the police on her. (In my previous post, I stated my mother loved blackmailing my sibilings and myself about a previous experience that led to my mother getting taken away for a short while by the police due to my father asking my brother to call the police. ) 

I called her out on her blackmailing and that she had no idea what's shes saying and how bad its affecting her connection to her children everytime she brings it up. And that I nor my siblings had no responsibility* over that situation (I wanted to say nothing to do with the situation but couldn't speak the correct word in her language). Including the fact that she guilt-trips me, by accusing me for putting her closer to the casket. Ended with my mother saying I thought we were mother and daughter and we had a friendship together.  

I was very surprised by this comment for she told me when I used to work with her, that she lectured me that i will be no more or less than her daughter and should respect her for shes the mother. (Insinuating that I shouldn't be acting like her friend and keep it to a repected mother and ""obedient"" daughter relationship. 

As I told her this it ended with her switching it around by playing her words on denying ever saying those words. Giving me the impression that I am heartless one, her blood pressure is on the line. My older sister involves herself defending my mother saying I should be ashamed for not noticing that my mothers health is falling that she could have died. (Bringing up her high blood pressure numbers and near death experience) 

Literally things kept escalating that led to my mother to insult my boyfriend. That his previous rudeness was not something she'll allow that I should had stand my own ground and defend myself. Basically to quit acting like being protected by my boyfriend. (He  defended me for my mother was yelling at me for having my car in the way where she can get in the driveway. And my boyfriend just clarified that it was him who accidentally parked too close for he was the one who was driving.)  It ended with her telling me that I'm being manipulated like a puppet by my father and boyfriend to see her as a ""bad guy"". 

That my boyfriend is no longer allowed to come inside my house. Clapped in front of me saying congratulations for telling her my feelings and  getting myself this far, also insinuating that I broke my relationship with her.

I am literally heartbroken and in tears, for I rarely see my boyfriend due to working and going to school and the only day off I can see him was only for 1 day. Now being unable to ask for permission to leave my house to go on a date with him or to hang out with him at my house has left my boyfriend and myself feeling very miserable. And I dont know what to do at this point to get passed this situation.

As always on weekdays,my niece (we'll call her Maya) has to take a nap. Today's kindergarten closing day, which begins the story. Freedom from school she thought would translate to leeway at home.
Facts to note: mum has a different way of getting her to sleep (sitting next to her, having this back and forth about not being sleepy and her telling her to close her eyes), mine is a time on the dot, instructions to go to her nap point and sleep (anxiety means a certain order of things to kept calm and on top of things)
So there she is, after lunch, way past her sleeping time. They're doing the usual, I'm washing the dishes.
Maya: There's no sleep.
Mum: Alright. Just stretch yourself there for the moment, it will come.
Few minutes later Maya's sitting up again. Point to note: she'd been given a sweet prior to, which didn't help.
Mum: close your eyes and sleep.
Maya: There's no sleep.
(Note how she doesn't say she's not sleepy)
Mum goes: Alright, close your eyes. It will come.
A few minutes later, she's sitting up. I'm hands deep in soapy water when I hear mum admonishing her. Here's where it's going to get real, I think.
She lays back down at some point and with mum's help and her sitting ext to her. She's still talking, then mum gets annoyed. Here's where she usually nods off, but not today, she determines. But no sleep. Again, up and sitting. Hoping to help, I remind her that if she doesn't sleep, there won't be going out to play. She loves playing with her friends more than with herself.
Mum picks that up, says, and here I scoffed: Today I'm in arms with (me). No sleep no play. (This just as her friends are passing by, loud as a playground, heading home from school)
Well, child felt it alright. P.s: thumb in the mouth, full belly equals sleepy.
I think, hm, alright. Let's wait for the foot or the sponge.
Then comes Maya's sleepy stubbornness. She's up from the chair, shuffling with thumb in mouth, dare in her eyes towards the living room doorway, hoping to head towards the outside door.
Mum: Where are you going?
Maya: To play. (Adrenaline up for me, ready to lock the door; kind of hoping for it because Shell start crying, which makes her more pliable. Think a tough day of frustrations where you either vent or cry to release, feeling better after?)
Mum, looking askance: Eeh? You will see.
I step in, saying: be prepared for the consequences.
Mum says to leave her. We'll see where she's going. Damn, I shouldn't have doubted mum, but I have a reason to.
See, I'm the strict one together with her mum, my sister. Our mother is the lovable gran that can spoil any child with quite the ocean of love. When she loves, she loves. She just needs checks and balances, which are hard to offer when she sets her mind.
But she's stubborn too, to the point she can fail to see an error until you one man punch it into her. Not to mention, criticism given as criticism gets you a viper's lash back.
Before, when Maya makes enough noise, screaming, crying, she'll tell me to unlock the door and let her out because she wants peace and quiet, which meant quite the arguments between us because I thought she was doing wrong by giving in and not setting enough of a boundary. I've recently learned mum's just big hearted and struggles with enforcing anything on anyone, including Maya.
Then I argued, just the other day: Maya's a child. Even her free time has to be monitored. She needs boundaries and rules in order to learn and grow with stability. Think of it as nurturing, not limiting.
Mama put her foot down today. Maya snoozed off two minutes before I finished the dishes. Guess who's learned gran can be tough too?
Other lesson to learn: love and sweetness should not undermine the importance of early set rules and boundaries. You want a descent child you are privately proud of in your home when you are with them? It starts with you. What are you showing your child, or any child, by giving in when they need to do something important like a nap?
","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this serves as advice?
As always on weekdays,my niece (we&amp;#39;ll call her Maya) has to take a nap. Today&amp;#39;s kindergarten closing day, which begins the story. Freedom from school she thought would translate to leeway at home.
Facts to note: mum has a different way of getting her to sleep (sitting next to her, having this back and forth about not being sleepy and her telling her to close her eyes), mine is a time on the dot, instructions to go to her nap point and sleep (anxiety means a certain order of things to kept calm and on top of things)
So there she is, after lunch, way past her sleeping time. They&amp;#39;re doing the usual, I&amp;#39;m washing the dishes.
Maya: There&amp;#39;s no sleep.
Mum: Alright. Just stretch yourself there for the moment, it will come.
Few minutes later Maya&amp;#39;s sitting up again. Point to note: she&amp;#39;d been given a sweet prior to, which didn&amp;#39;t help.
Mum: close your eyes and sleep.
Maya: There&amp;#39;s no sleep.
(Note how she doesn&amp;#39;t say she&amp;#39;s not sleepy)
Mum goes: Alright, close your eyes. It will come.
A few minutes later, she&amp;#39;s sitting up. I&amp;#39;m hands deep in soapy water when I hear mum admonishing her. Here&amp;#39;s where it&amp;#39;s going to get real, I think.
She lays back down at some point and with mum&amp;#39;s help and her sitting ext to her. She&amp;#39;s still talking, then mum gets annoyed. Here&amp;#39;s where she usually nods off, but not today, she determines. But no sleep. Again, up and sitting. Hoping to help, I remind her that if she doesn&amp;#39;t sleep, there won&amp;#39;t be going out to play. She loves playing with her friends more than with herself.
Mum picks that up, says, and here I scoffed: Today I&amp;#39;m in arms with (me). No sleep no play. (This just as her friends are passing by, loud as a playground, heading home from school)
Well, child felt it alright. P.s: thumb in the mouth, full belly equals sleepy.
I think, hm, alright. Let&amp;#39;s wait for the foot or the sponge.
Then comes Maya&amp;#39;s sleepy stubbornness. She&amp;#39;s up from the chair, shuffling with thumb in mouth, dare in her eyes towards the living room doorway, hoping to head towards the outside door.
Mum: Where are you going?
Maya: To play. (Adrenaline up for me, ready to lock the door; kind of hoping for it because Shell start crying, which makes her more pliable. Think a tough day of frustrations where you either vent or cry to release, feeling better after?)
Mum, looking askance: Eeh? You will see.
I step in, saying: be prepared for the consequences.
Mum says to leave her. We&amp;#39;ll see where she&amp;#39;s going. Damn, I shouldn&amp;#39;t have doubted mum, but I have a reason to.

At one moment, I could ask him the simplest question, like something like what happened today, and he would get angry, assuming all my motives, thinking I'm against him, and the next, he's calm, and sweet and comes and hugs and apologises, never directly though, it's always like ""haha what do you eattt, you get so angry, and then you make others around you angry, especially me"" 

I'm done with this. I'm so done with this. Today I didn't react, I just didn't even look him in eyes , I looked everywhere but at him. It can obviously be seen I cried alot. And thats all that I get? A hug and a quarter ass apology that ends up blaming me for the aggressive response. 

The situation was that he wanted me to write down a plan of how to improve our financial situation, so he could show it to my mom. The problem is , he's been writing this same plan, talking about it, repeating talking about it, spent hours each day just 'discusing' it. He won't implement it, and it's no use to do this. It's not even like the plan is improved each time, it's the same thing everyday. 

He keeps wasting my mom's time everyday, and then some days mine, just doing this. My mom is a teacher, she works till 2 pm and then when we come home she cooks, she cleans, she teaches my siblings, and she takes care of his ass like he's a fifth child in our house. Then she has to listen to all this. Recently my grandma has been sick, (my grandpa passed away a few months ago too so just add that on) and so my mom tries to spend 2-3 hours talking to her. 

For some reason this makes him feel inferior. When my mom says we've talked about this so much, I've told you what you should do too, why don't you do it, he gets angry. He flips, he goes apeshit crazy. Saying that she has time to talk to her mom she can't talk to him, and it's just so stupid he keeps repeating that we can't sit down and talk to him. 

Today the same happened with me, except that he started shit talking about my mom. Kept on calling her names. Started saying ""your an idiot, just like how ur mom's an idiot, you're both idiots. Tomorrow when we'll be on the streets, and hungry and you'll have to beg for it, I'll see where your cleverness goes then, you just don't want to talk to me, as if I'm wasting your time. You spend hours on that phone and IM wasting your time.  Look at me, I'm wearing the same clothes as I was 4 years ago, these expenses they're all yours and your mom's, go to hell I don't care about you. Fuck off""

LIKE HES THE ONE WHO DOESNT FIX HIS WARDROBE, EVERYTIME HE HAS TO GO OUT HE ASKS MY MOM TO TAKE OUT CLOTHES FOR HIM. HE CANT EVEN DECIDE WHAT SOCKS TO WEAR WITHOUT HER. HES A COMPLETE CHILD AND IM SURPRISED LIFE HASNT KICKED HIM IN THE BALLS AND LEFT THEM BLUE YET. 

this is why no one likes him. No one likes to be his friend or anything. He never accepts his mistakes in front of others till it's too late. 

And it's. Too late now. I won't ever forgive him. I tried so hard in these past two years to change my attitude about him, but I'm done. 

People that you have to give excuses to yourself for, aren't worth it.

I wish my parents get divorced. Long story into a couple of sentences:

My dad met my mom when they were in high-school. He was her senior at their boarding school. They dated, and a couple of months into the relationship my mom notices he tends to get obsessive. He won't let her wear shorts in public, won't let her connect with male and female friends, and controls her diet. Through such a repressive relationship, she starts to harbour feelings for someone else. She cheats on my dad, and he controls her even more BUT they stay together. When my mom was pregnant with me, my dad held a knife to her head and threatened to kill her if she ever cheated again. Couple of years later, and after we move from India to Canada, she cheats again.

It was sleepless nights for me because he would yell and scream at her with my younger sister and I in the same room. Man, it was tough growing up. I became so quick to pick up on subtle changes to his mood, that I am now very sensitive to how people feel. I remember he wrote ""BITCH"" and ""WHORE"" on the bedroom wall, and the image of my mom rubbing those words off is just seared into my memories. At the age of 12 my dad would tell me love doesn't exist, people closest to you will cheat you and that my mom was the worst mother in the world. He would also go out of his way to tell my mom that my sister and I would hate her when we grew up. ALSO he had this weird obsession over the ""honour of a family"" and how ours was destroyed. My mom would tell that men only care for sex, that I should protect my virginity, that men are irrational and take advantage of you. Their relationship fucked up my own notions of love and relationship, though I am actively trying to unpack and unlearn everything. OH and he left his email account open one day. I typed my mom's name and found correspondence to relatives in Nepal, India, and America. Basically all my relatives know that my mom cheated and they all pity him. I also found out he has a catfish account, and that he has phone sex with women from Bhutan. The second guy my mom cheated with is still her friend, and he buys her a-lot of stuff, like shoes and bags. After ALL of that, they're still married.

My parents don't really talk to each other, so my sister and I have to mediate everything. ""Go tell your mom to get ready"",""Go tell your dad to bring his laundry"". It's been this way all my teen years, and I feel I missed out on my childhood. I wasn't allowed to hang out with my friends because my dad thought I would become a whore. I have been repressed all 22 years of my life, and now I want to run away, but I don't want my dad to end up hurting my mom. I don't know, I guess I'm writing this to get everything off my chest because my dad was yelling at my mom again and I felt so helpless. Every time he shouts I freeze up and go silent.

In my perspective that is.

So I live in a house that holds me, my sister, my grandma and grandpa, and my father. My sister (Who I'll name OS \[Older Sister\] for this story) is outright rude and disrespectful in a lot of ways. She was approximately 16, or a year older at the time, when this situation occurred. My age at the time was around 14.

So, when all of my parents are out of the house and it's just me and my sister, OS gets a little... lets say abusive, and not just towards me. She's been going through multiple ""Boyfriends"" yet, none of the family is solid on all of it yet. But this current ""Boyfriend"" (We'll call him SB \[Sister's Boyfriend\]) was like, 8 or 10 years older than OS. When my parents are out of the house, OS likes to take the home phone, and contact SB. They don't have a working relationship at all, so OS is always complaining left and right to SB, and he's having none of it, yet he still stays her boyfriend. And within that complaining is yelling. And I stress, so. Damn. Much when there is yelling. SB apparently says he was going to Splash, over what I heard OS respond with, and OS wants to go. But guess how much money she has? None! Because most of the things she gets now, are because my parents are buying it all for her. OS supposedly gets the NEED to go with SB, (Who lives in a different city) though she has no money to enter Splash. Who does she ask first to cover for her? SB. How does SB respond? ""No"". I'm sure there was a reason behind the no, but I wont go into that. OS then STORMS into my room, I believe I was in a ball with my hands over my ears to stop hearing her yelling, and demands that I give her money. I don't have money, but given the context and if I did have money, I wouldn't have even given her money. She then proceeds to yell at ME to, and this is 100% correct, STEAL from my grandparents money that they keep in a container. I have never in my life wanted to steal from anyone, but because OS was yelling at me, mind you I was under a TON of stress at the time, what other choice did I have? I was literally in tears as I got out the amount she wanted, then bolted to my room, and got onto my bed in a ball. An idea soon popped into my head. I got on to my PC which was close to my bed and told my mother about this. The following links are to pictures (in order) of how this conversation went.

A little later into the conversation I asked her to come pick me up (Since my mother lives in a different city), she was not able to do so, so I couldn't get away from OS. In the middle of the conversation, OS had left, slamming the door behind her. I laid down in my bed, contemplating what just happened. But this incident left a mark, and I don't think it's going away anytime soon. Now when I get handed money, even if it is virtual currency, I advise the owner of money to keep it, as I feel like I am stealing again.

Just one problem from one person has affected my life greatly. I hope I can post something like this in r/ProRevenge when I come up with a good plan to get back at OS. But for now, I just sit until that day comes along, and wait for the right moment to strike back, and make her see how it feels to be stressed. And to this day forward, I still wish I was an only child.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have an older sibling, you may know how this feels, yet this one goes out of norm.

Not to mention the house which it turned upside down for the 12th time and the dishes that now somehow represent a mountain of crusted leftovers that no one can remember to rinse.

   I cannot count how many times I have excused myself to go poop (this seems to be the only excuse that works since no one seems to want to interrupt during) just to take a moment to stare at the tired and rundown reflection of myself. One day I might learn that the excuse of my own cooking tends to result in me yelling through the door at the sound of yelling and high-pitched screams, followed by my husbands half-attempt of a warning. As I pretend to tug out my own hair, I remind myself to try and sneak a real shower, my bird baths don't quite do me justice.

   Motherhood is so glamourize in the movies. The mothers are so put together as if their kids don't wake up at the ass-crack of dawn, right when she gets her 10 month old to bed finally. I love my kids, I love my husband but I hate them all in the same room together. The constant tournament to see who will cry first, always ending in a ring match with hair pulling, face kicking and somehow resulting in a Fortnite dance battle...?

   I recently found myself a stay at home mother after an unfortunate turn of events. I was excited to spend more time with the kids, excited to do activities and science projects and watch movies while we fell asleep for naps. It was fun at first, having girl time all day with our daughters (10 months old and 3yrs) while the boys were in school. But I would soon regret the hour school let out, I was about to learn the sounds of complete chaos, the kind that makes you panic with complete shock as the calm transformed into terror.

   It has been one month. ONE MONTH. And I found myself half crazed, eye twitching, hair in dreads, same clothes on for 3 days, rocking myself in desperation to self comfort. The start of the breakdown actually occured after my husbands constant scoldings and remarks about the house being a wreck as he comes home from a 14 hour work day. He felt the need to repeat himself as he once again pcut in his request for a clean home upon his return from his construction job. I felt ashamed at first, how DID I let this mess turn into a scene left by a tornado's destruction? I could have found time to clean the dishes instead of taking a much needed nap as the girls slept for 20 minutes. I am a wife and a mother, I shouldn't let this get out of hand, I will get ahold of myself tomorrow.

   For a week I made sure the house was spotless, not one crumb on the floor, laundry done, dishes cleaned and put away, homework successfully done, dinner made, and kids not fighting as my worn out husband walked through the door. A week I mustered the energy to trace behind my children, sweeping the floor clean after every step. Went to bed after midnight because the dishes stack up with 7 mouths to feed, the last of laundry to fold, and counters to wipe down. For a week I was the perfect wife and mother as I attended to their needs and cleaned up after their accidents.

    As I drifted off to sleep one night, I was woken up suddenly by my body jolting uncontrollably, like a fish out of water. I never had a seizure before, but my mind knew what it was before I had the chance to comprehend it. For a week my head arm and leg shook at the sound of our 10 month old daughter cried in agony as she teethed during the night. The start of our children's smart-assed and never-ending unnecessary debates brought on the tremors instantly, creating yet another debate on who's fault it was that mom was ""cold"" again. (That being our explanation to our younger kids so they wouldn't be scared). The doctors merely explained I was under a lot of stress with high anxiety and prescribed me Lexapro and Hydroxyzine, one to make me happy, the other to knock me out cold.

   I felt defeated, I couldn't even take care of my family and household as I should. What kind of woman was I? Feeling helpless and embarrassed, I took my pills...and when I woke up...it was two days later and I was furious.   
I was so consumed in making my kids and husband were catered to, I didn't realize my own body was worn out beyond its limits. I am a MOTHER to 5 amazing children in which 4 of them are quite capable in cleaning their own messes, rinsing their dishes, putting away their clothes, and cleaning up their own rooms. I am also a WIFE, who is just as worn out as her husband is and deserve to sit down as he does the dishes from dinner I made sure was done as he walked in the door to the sounds of our kids and their angry remarks and name-calling.

   So yes, I am crazy. I am crazy in love with my chaotic and never boring family that I wouldn't know what to do without. But, as mothers and wives must remember we are raising kids to be able to survive on their own after they move out. Our kids don't look up from the games long enough to learn about how to live. We must remember if we clean up all their messes, how will they know what to do when we aren't there? And don't forget to ask your spouse for help, we aren't perfect, and it takes a lot to keep it all together.

I love my kids, I love my husband but I hate them all in the same room together. The constant tournament to see who will cry first, always ending in a ring match with hair pulling, face kicking and somehow resulting in a Fortnite dance battle...?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   I recently found myself a stay at home mother after an unfortunate turn of events. I was excited to spend more time with the kids, excited to do activities and science projects and watch movies while we fell asleep for naps. It was fun at first, having girl time all day with our daughters (10 months old and 3yrs) while the boys were in school. But I would soon regret the hour school let out, I was about to learn the sounds of complete chaos, the kind that makes you panic with complete shock as the calm transformed into terror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   It has been one month. ONE MONTH. And I found myself half crazed, eye twitching, hair in dreads, same clothes on for 3 days, rocking myself in desperation to self comfort. The start of the breakdown actually occured after my husbands constant scoldings and remarks about the house being a wreck as he comes home from a 14 hour work day. He felt the need to repeat himself as he once again pcut in his request for a clean home upon his return from his construction job. I felt ashamed at first, how DID I let this mess turn into a scene left by a tornado&amp;#39;s destruction? I could have found time to clean the dishes instead of taking a much needed nap as the girls slept for 20 minutes. I am a wife and a mother, I shouldn&amp;#39;t let this get out of hand, I will get ahold of myself tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   For a week I made sure the house was spotless, not one crumb on the floor, laundry done, dishes cleaned and put away, homework successfully done, dinner made, and kids not fighting as my worn out husband walked through the door. A week I mustered the energy to trace behind my children, sweeping the floor clean after every step. Went to bed after midnight because the dishes stack up with 7 mouths to feed, the last of laundry to fold, and counters to wipe down. For a week I was the perfect wife and mother as I attended to their needs and cleaned up after their accidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    As I drifted off to sleep one night, I was woken up suddenly by my body jolting uncontrollably, like a fish out of water. I never had a seizure before, but my mind knew what it was before I had the chance to comprehend it. For a week my head arm and leg shook at the sound of our 10 month old daughter cried in agony as she teethed during the night. The start of our children&amp;#39;s smart-assed and never-ending unnecessary debates brought on the tremors instantly, creating yet another debate on who&amp;#39;s fault it was that mom was &amp;quot;cold&amp;quot; again. (That being our explanation to our younger kids so they wouldn&amp;#39;t be scared). The doctors merely explained I was under a lot of stress with high anxiety and prescribed me Lexapro and Hydroxyzine, one to make me happy, the other to knock me out cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   I felt defeated, I couldn&amp;#39;t even take care of my family and household as I should. What kind of woman was I? Feeling helpless and embarrassed, I took my pills...and when I woke up...it was two days later and I was furious.&lt;br/&gt;
I was so consumed in making my kids and husband were catered to, I didn&amp;#39;t realize my own body was worn out beyond its limits. I am a MOTHER to 5 amazing children in which 4 of them are quite capable in cleaning their own messes, rinsing their dishes, putting away their clothes, and cleaning up their own rooms. I am also a WIFE, who is just as worn out as her husband is and deserve to sit down as he does the dishes from dinner I made sure was done as he walked in the door to the sounds of our kids and their angry remarks and name-calling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   So yes, I am crazy. I am crazy in love with my chaotic and never boring family that I wouldn&amp;#39;t know what to do without. But, as mothers and wives must remember we are raising kids to be able to survive on their own after they move out. Our kids don&amp;#39;t look up from the games long enough to learn about how to live. We must remember if we clean up all their messes, how will they know what to do when we aren&amp;#39;t there? And don&amp;#39;t forget to ask your spouse for help, we aren&amp;#39;t perfect, and it takes a lot to keep it all together.&lt;/p&gt;

So my parents and i have a pretty good relationship (especially with my mom). That means i usually tell them my problems or mistakes and they trust me. I never had a problem if i was a bit too drunk or something like that. Also they believe me when i say that i did or not do something.

One thing they don't approve is weed (and other drugs ofc). They told me i that when i would be old enough i can try because almost all People do (weed that is). I did try it but also kept doing it.

Am i a bad son for this or is this just one of the thing you don't tell your parents because there isn't really a problem?

But this week has been rough. I just found out my dad was in town the last week and didn’t contact me. 

A bit of background he lives in another state comes into town about once a month, he always emails the family his flight reservations or puts it on a family calendar. Also, my family usually gets together for a dinner when he’s here. 

This time there was no email, no invite for dinner nor any mention that he was even in town. I had only heard after, when I called my mom and she mentioned the time they both spent with my other siblings throughout the week, and that my sister had just left taking him to the airport. 

Feeling hurt, I sent him a text saying thanks for letting me know he was in town. He sent me a text saying he didn’t know that I didn’t know, and left me a voicemail trying to apologize when he landed. 

I spent the night crying off and on between my SO trying to distract me, cheer me up and comfort me. 

I know he didn’t do it on purpose, but I’m really hurt that he just forgot to tell me. All I want to do is ignore him and shut him out to show him how hurt I feel. I know that might not be reasonable or productive, but I’m 25 and I feel like a child crying to my dad and telling him he hurt my feelings.

It’s just hurtful that he forgot about me and didn’t seem to realize in that week that I wasn’t around. I can’t seem to find a way to justify that other than the fact that he just doesn’t care if I’m around. Can anyone provide me with perspective from other points of view to gain understanding on this situation?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me preface thus by saying I have a good relationship with my family, we are all supportive and close to each other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this week has been rough. I just found out my dad was in town the last week and didn’t contact me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit of background he lives in another state comes into town about once a month, he always emails the family his flight reservations or puts it on a family calendar. Also, my family usually gets together for a dinner when he’s here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time there was no email, no invite for dinner nor any mention that he was even in town. I had only heard after, when I called my mom and she mentioned the time they both spent with my other siblings throughout the week, and that my sister had just left taking him to the airport. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feeling hurt, I sent him a text saying thanks for letting me know he was in town. He sent me a text saying he didn’t know that I didn’t know, and left me a voicemail trying to apologize when he landed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the night crying off and on between my SO trying to distract me, cheer me up and comfort me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know he didn’t do it on purpose, but I’m really hurt that he just forgot to tell me. All I want to do is ignore him and shut him out to show him how hurt I feel. I know that might not be reasonable or productive, but I’m 25 and I feel like a child crying to my dad and telling him he hurt my feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just hurtful that he forgot about me and didn’t seem to realize in that week that I wasn’t around. I can’t seem to find a way to justify that other than the fact that he just doesn’t care if I’m around. Can anyone provide me with perspective from other points of view to gain understanding on this situation?&lt;/p&gt;

I can say my mom has some fault in this for making my siblings super judgmental and talking in a way children shouldn't be talking. They'll cuss at each other, call each other mean names and it's not your regular sibling tough love. This is having my 7yr old brother telling racist remarks to my 11yr old brother. NOT OK. We're a Mexican family so my mom could care less about politics or anything so this isn't influenced at home, they learn all this on the internet or at school. My mom is too focused on working hard to sustain 4 kids, she can barely pay attention to any of them. When she is home, she's on her phone or yelling at everyone to clean. They have a 1bd 1bth, 600 sqft. apartment but she refuses to move and refuses any type of change. She is comfortable where she's at and won't look at what my siblings need. I am definitely willing to help and do anything to help them live in a bigger space. I can only do so much since I have my own bills to pay.

 Long story short, my 11yr old brother has been surfacing some serious anger issues to the point where he wants to hit my mom and other siblings and I don't know how to approach the situation. I talked to him and he feels left out, he feels like my mom is ignoring him and the only way for him to express his frustration is to be angry. He's not a bad kid, just very upset and wants his privacy. I tried talking to my mom about that specifically and she was very upset that I questioned her and said that there's nothing wrong with him and he's just being a brat. I told her that I felt the same way when I lived with her and I felt like I couldn't talk to anyone about my depression and how I felt rejected (she believes that depression isn't real and that I'm just faking it).

My siblings have a shit dad \[54M\] that scares the living hell out of them when they go visit since he has partial custody of them. I can't talk to him since he's a massive asshole and could care less about what's happening and I've tried. All he says is that I have no business getting into their lives because I'm not an ""adult"". I am more of an adult than he'll ever be in his miserable life living off govt. assistance.

I can't have them go to counseling becuase my mom will refuse. I don't know what to do to be quite honest. I want them to have a better living situation.. at least have an extra room to be in for time alone.

1.) She can’t afford gas for her car, but will, “pay me back later,” for the gas she runs out of mine (I.e. she always pays me back, but it’s normally a month later each time)

2.) She can’t pay for insurance or tags on her only car

3.) Her car’s transmission is going out. Her fiancé doesn’t know how to fix it, and they say they can’t afford a new transmission (or new car)  until his taxes kick in (they will earn at least $6,00 which is more than what I will make back).

My dilemma:

I work hard for my money. And I feel like I’ve practically raised my niece and nephew (I’M the one who buys the kids’ clothing, toys, etc. because my sister and her finance are pieces of shit).

My sister is hinting around for me to give her my car. Free. 

I’m only considering this because I worry about the children. I’ve tried fighting for legal custody of them, and I keep failing, but my sister definitely needs a vehicle to use for the children’s benefit while she’s the legal guardian. For emergencies, groceries, etc.

Plus, with a car of her own, she wouldn’t call me to constantly borrow mine.

And I KNOW they are going to blow their tax money on stupid crap, like drugs or “$1,000 a guard dog,” instead of buying a car!

BUT... I’m sick of supporting my sister. I’m even at the point where I’m sick of supporting my niece &amp; nephew financially, because I can’t even take care of myself! 

I work hard for my money but I have nothing to show for myself. I don’t have anything in savings, I don’t own my home, and I can’t even go to the movies when I want to because I am broke from spending on everyone else!

Would it be selfish of me to refuse to give my sister my car? 

Or should I sell it, and use the money on myself to build towards my own future? (I would like to create a savings account and go back to school- a community college).

Anyways, for all my life, my brother’s never had to do anything like vacuum.

Just today it was brought to my attention that I have an extremely early bedtime for a junior in high school (9:30-10:00) and when I tried to appeal for a bedtime at 10:30 my dad got really upset with me, saying how I got up early (at 6) and I needed that sleep and he wasn’t willing to compromise. Now, to be honest, that fact itself wasn’t really an issue; strict parents am I right? And yet, I remembered when my brother was in highschool, he got to stay up as late as he wanted. I told this to my dad, and he told me my brother was different and it didn’t matter what time he went to bed. I also brought up the fact I used to go to bed at 10:30 in middle school, until my mom randomly decided I should go to bed an hour earlier. He didn’t remember this (bad memory) and thought I was lying. 

Just a few minutes ago, my dad caught me crying, since the previous conversation had happened a few minutes before this, and I had been texting my friends about it so I was still really emotional. He asked what was wrong and I tried not to tell him because telling him what’s bothering me usually turns out badly but he sounded concerned and I told him. Bad decision. When I was trying to explain how he treats me differently than my brother, I had brought up the chores, and he immediately started ranting to me about how I don’t do anything around the house and that I was spoiled. I tried telling him that this is why I didn’t want to tell him and that I wanted to go upstairs, but as I left he yelled at me to come back and then continued to yell at me. My mom has come down at this point and asked him what was wrong so I was allowed to go upstairs since he had to explain it to her. 

I know I sound super spoiled in this and to be fair I know I am but I hate being treated differently only to get a “because I said so”.

“Fuck you, die already. This is how fucked up your family is. You are trying to make grandpa and Grandma my responsibility when your entire family won’t take care of them. You owe me everything you have. Your daughter next to you because of me. You and your retarded ways could easily made you lose your daughter. Everything you have is because of me you fat selfish cunt. Your family kicked out grandma and grandpa for having Alzheimer’s and being sick. Fucking retarded. And I know it’s (your daughter me) writing your text. Read this text you little brat. You eating good huh? Sleeping good huh? Kicked out grandpa and grandma because he kept a waking you up. What the fuck would you know about real problems. You kicked out grandpa and grandma because he kept knocking on your door! You have no easy how you got it. how about I take back my home back and make you, your brother, your father and your retarded mother of yours homeless. Maybe then you would understand what real hardship is. Everything your mother and father have is because of me.” 
There’s plenty more.

1) he’s homeless because he stole from my parents Buddha shrine, claiming he has rights to it. He trash the place TWICE. And he says “I didn’t kick myself out, you (mom) kicked me out”... my mom response “you definitely kicked yourself out the moment you kept stealing money, I accepted it a few times but the money you stole was from great grandma”. He told us we can just replace the money justifying it as the money replaced is already his. In which he tried to get when he barged into the house (my mom thought it was our dad coming from work) took the envelope and ripped it to only see Thai money.

2) we offer him to live with grandpa and grandma because there’s an extra room. Which he can use to get his life “back” because he’s homeless and living in the car mom bought him.

3) I don’t live with grandpa and grandma, they live with my uncle and his wife... his wife didn’t want her parents-in-law to live with her family because for sure 1 reason is grandpa tried to burn down the house with the kids. But she put up with it because he is her husband father. The other reason I know is my aunt is scared of grandpa at night, that he might do something to her daughter, he kept trying to enter her room every night 2am and kept trying for hours.

4)nobody wanted to take care of the grandparents because 1 each family have their own grandparents and family to take care of. My family don’t have enough room. Like yeah I was quite annoyed with them everyone is not just me! But I never kicked them out I don’t have th authority to. The adults didn’t have a plan other than have them move from family to family to keep them preoccupied because 1 my aunt didn’t want them anymore/ annoyed and 2 they were always bored doing nothing at the house. The way my mom explained to my step brother made him twist it into his brain thinking we kicked them out and made them homeless. They are not homeless. It turns out to be better this way because now other relatives can go see him, they’re a lot  closer. And he can go in safe walking distance to go see them too.

5) he took care of me and my brother when we were babies. When we are able to walk I was always with my aunts and cousins! I started working ever since school introduce math to me! I don’t even remember him in my childhood years! I always went to boys and girls club! And he stated that he’s my real father. When he stated that I wouldn’t be here is probably because I make a lot of online friends we click I don’t click with any irl people. That’s just how it is with me. I feel like people are more real and can be their selfs when they’re in their comfort zone playing Minecraft or league of legends and other games out there. We had so much fun and obviously he wanted to take that away from me and pressured my mom to do it because she kept telling me to not make friends when they no nothing about these people and about me.  I made friends in different places, they video chat but I didn’t. I thought it was cool to see another place and that they’re sharing it with me. And again no one was taking advantage of me like everyone keeps thinking! More genuine people I meet than the people in my school and family. It’s doesn’t happen to everyone I get it but I was lucky enough to meet cool people.

6)he’s states he done everything for the family, the business... it’s been over 20 years. Those 20 years have been me and my brother. And those 20 years he’s been collecting about 20k possibly even more from my mom. 2 cars, and money for apartments and bills. Crying that mom pays for her other sons bills when that’s not true. He keeps saying “why can’t you give me this! You always give your favorite money, you always pays his bills, you bought them their cars, your paying x college tuition, you paid it for him!!!”.
Call mom, aunt and uncle all those cuss words and my mom says “okay, you know they’re aunt and uncle you have to respect them okay, they helped you so much but now what! No one else is going to help you except me because I am your mother I will always help you but if you don’t respect me, whose going to help you when I die... but if I’m such a shit mother im such a shit mother then why are you calling me why are you asking for money.”

7) we can only help him to a certain extent. He has to be able to help himself. But he blames everything on the family on everyone. The reason why he lost his jobs. The reason why he’s homeless etc etc. he lets it effect him. It effect him I get that but why doesn’t he seek help from a professional. No he rather wants to seek revenge and see the family suffer. Using commit suicide to make my mother bend to him, because he’s going to say what a shit mother he had.
Aunt and uncle offered him a room in their house for 3 years. He did nothing but sometimes cut the lawn or help carry rice for grandparents. But he has no job, didn’t pay rent. He stayed in the room or came over to my family house to play  games in my room (2am during my highscool years) or my brothers room. We offered hey, I took therapy and it might be great for you. He brushes it off because “I have no problems, there’s no issues with me”. 

He’s asking mom for more money and more money. Repeating the same thing over and over again. Blames my mom for the reason he was in jail, Gets mad at my mom because she didn’t t bail him out, and blames my brother the reason why he got into a car accident, blames me for losing his job... 
1) fought someone over what?? 

2) called our uncle not mom! How else would she have bailed you??
2a) if he can’t explain what happened to his boss than he basically gave it up.
2b) your not evicted right away! You just said You got kicked out from the complex. It doesn’t work that way or what, what did you say... oh “if I ever see that guy again ima beat his ass”. Then his case would’ve been a lot worse 

3)you were wasted and angry because of what our other uncle was joking and crash someone’s car

4) if you can’t come to pick me up! Then don’t come!!!!! I didn’t ask! Mom did!! And even then It was even necessary! (Guy asking me if I wanted to ride in his car... made no sense) I didn’t even want him in my life I didn’t want to get in his car! I didn’t want him to pick me up!

We’re realizing he has mental health issues but we can’t force him to go get help...

Other family members are thinking its best to cut him out of our lives.  But it’s sad to even think that because so many people thought he was going to take care of the family. And he was so nice and etc etc.. they don’t want us to give up, yet don’t know what to do anymore.


My mom is too nice, she says she want to drop him, but she can’t because he is her son. And this is all she can do for him, which is give him money. She feels sad that he son thinks this way, and doesn’t understand or know how to help. All she did her whole life was to use her own life so her children and grandchildren’s can have money for their future. She worked and worked so we can live in an apartment, have food, clothes , shoes, education. And yet she gives the most to the trouble kid and he isn’t even thankful because it’s not enough since it’s not all of it. My step brother states that she won’t give him al the money when she had so much (which she used to buy new vans and a car for the business and for transportation), his reasoning is because my uncle TL (after or before his 2nd stroke he was starting to lose his memory) told” him that mom had all this money and blah blah... I’m sure my mom is worried that  when she’s gone that he’ll come for everyone/claim her inheritance. 

I hope other family’s get the help they need unlike how my family turned out to be. I hope you can catch the signs earlier to give family the help they need before it manifest and becomes too late.

When my grandma was sick my uncle and his family went on a trip while ignoring how much my grandma was suffering and my father had no problem with that but when I asked my father to let me go hangout with my friends (after my grandma was well) he denied making silly excuses . He doesn&amp;#39;t want to fullfil neither mine nor my mothers needs. While he would help others with  which is a good thing but why does he start conserving money when I or my mother ask for something. He would allow my cousin who is just 1 year older than me to take his car and go hangout while if I will ask for d same or if my mom wants to go shopping he would say that he has to go somewhere for work while later on what we get to know that he was hanging out with his brother or friends. Idk but he doesn&amp;#39;t hate me or my mother but neither loves us . One would cooperate in conserving things if his family&amp;#39;s financial condition is not well but when you see that others like your cousins and their family r enjoying as hell while you&amp;#39;re just sitting on your ass feeling depressed , it makes me hate my father.😔. He has time for others but not us . &lt;/p&gt;

-I’m the older sister, I have one younger sister let’s call her J. We are 5 years apart. She is now 15. 
- J is the baby of the family and she is treated like one
-When I was a child my parents were poor so as a result I too was poor lol. My sister was too young to really remember not getting what you want all the time or having small Christmas’s or whatevah
-My parents got better jobs and basically they’re pretty rich now. So my sister is growing up getting whatever she wants and never really hears no
-everything is done for her 
-I am in college full time and work, I live at home but buy all my own stuff even though my parents don’t make me, just because I want to help out. 

So J is just a piece of shit. She lies to my parents, doesn’t clean up after herself EVER, goes to school late every single day, is the Regina George of her high school (aka a fucking bitch) and is literally so ungrateful for everything. 
She gets everything she wants, designer makeup, Victoria’s Secret everything, jolyns swimsuits like a billion of them, money whenever she asks, hundreds of dollars worth of skateboards (bc she’s suddenly decided she can skate or some shit?) uggs and vans whenever she asks. She gets anything and everything. 
My mom makes her breakfast in the morning &amp; tries to help her as best as she possibly can to get to school on time, and J just says mean shit under her breath. For ex: “J what would you like for breakfast?” “God mom leave me alone you’re stressing me out” *she says as she’s putting her expensive fenty foundation on and staring in the mirror* *mom exits bc she doesn’t want a problem I guess* “god what a bitch she never leaves me alone” 
One of her friends confronted her one time &amp; said why’re you so mean to your mom &amp; J said “she easy to boss around and if someone is easy to boss around I’ll do it.” Like she’s some fucking goddess or something. I was disgusted when I heard this but I was also half awake and not prepared for that. 
She gets mad at our dogs for doing puppy things. Like she leaves her fucking shoes on the ground in the living room &amp; our mischievous puppers chewed them up. She tells me she’s going to kill them and will hit them (not too hard but I never want anybody to lay a hand on my babies) and tell them she hates them &amp; is just so mean to them, innocent dogs! Is it annoying yes? But it’s her fault for leaving her shit in their reach when we have repeatedly warned her and I feel she should have learned from watching all my shit get eaten whenever I was lazy and didn’t pick something up.   
Anyways, her behavior is the fucking worst. What should I do? I can’t fucking take her anymore. She is a rodent, I want nothing to do with her. I have issues with my parents sometimes too, as any child does, but I love them and I don’t want her disrespecting them. 
I think they’re too easy on her for whatever reason. 
I genuinely feel like she should go to boarding school, or get all her shit taken away or SOMETHING. Anything. I would love if she got taken to boarding school, but I think it’d kill my parents.
I hate my sister. I feel the weight of the words escape my mind and as I’m typing them here, it feels right. I hate her. She doesn’t deserve ANY of the incredibly nice things she’s received. 
 What do I do to fucking deal with her? ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Break down:

Background: this was extremely unexpected. My sister has always been the good one, hard working, drug free, going places. I ask her for advice on money/banking/credit because she's always been more responsible and knowledgeable than me despite being quite a bit younger.

Everyday I get discriminated against by random people of how because I parent my kids. Does anyone else have this problem. Like how do you resolve these issues?

For example, two nights ago my wife and I took our 3 kids to Olive Garden. Some background, our youngest, Jacsin, is 7 years old. We decided to continue breastfeeding him till he’s 8, as well as diapering him. It’s just too difficult to potty train and much healthier to breast feed. I did the same for the older two kids.

Anyways, while we were dining. Jacsin did a big poop in his diaper. After 10 minutes of him screaming about his butt being mushy, the poop started to stink really bad. I realized I had to change it. However, the bathroom was too far from the table. Honestly, the restaurant should have bathroom closer to our table. My wife and I have talked about suing the restaurant because of this. 

I couldn’t change Jacsin at our table, because we didn’t want to mess up our food. So, plan C it was. I approached the neighboring table of two dining couples. I said excuse me and plopped Jacsin on table, accidentally knocking over a few glasses. 

I proceeded to change Jacsin’s diaper and accidentally spilled some creamy clumps of poop into the customers pasta dishes. Instead of being understanding of my dilema, the couples started to scream. I hushed them and told them to be more compassionate. Suddenly, Jacsin, with diaper down, started squirting and spewing diarrhea all over the couples’ , their food and their table. All of them got it in their mouths. 


They immediately called for the manager while I quickly sat Jacsin back down at our table. Once the manager approached us, he told us to leave the restaurant. I told him no, this is a restaurant and families are welcome too. I was so angry that I threatened to never come back.

 Luckily, the manager let us stay. He ended up kicking couples out because he didn’t want to loose our business. Honestly, I was so mad at the couples I tipped 18 cents on a $75 meal.

Fuck those customers. They’re just another example of people mistreating us because we’re parents. I just wanted to see if any other parents have similar problems.

she starts to yell and me and we get into a big argument and she told me to stop cleaning for her, passive aggressivly complaining that i shouldnt have started in the first place. but this seriously needs to be done!!!! the house is a mess, and when guests come over its an uncomfortable experience. i havent invited friends over since middle school because its too embarrassing, especially since im supposed to be in charge of all the cleaning in the first place..

The typical day begins with my being with-held food at the morning, with my mom refusing to cook me food until dinner time. So the wait begins, as I am locked in my room, blocked from the Internet, with-held from making friends, and forced to go to a stupid charter school where practically no one is allowed to make friends. This continued on throughout my 6 year old life. Whenever I DID TALK TO MY PARENTS, it was usually my alcoholic father beating up my mom or hitting and screaming at me. Then comes the later years... (oh great, hopefully it changes, right?) Also, being severely underweight for my age was a big plus!

I am screamed at every single day by my alcoholic, violent father who is worthy of Stone Cold Steve Austin levels of asshole. Some days I would get my 7-14 year old frail body beat up by my own father. If that didn't happen, they sent me to martial arts classes to get beat up by a professional. Despite breaking my arm, back, and suffering loads of bruises and cuts, my parents still forced my young self to martial arts right after school while screaming at me on the way there. Thanks mom and dad. You are worthy of getting arrested. (Oh yeah, what's a doctor? Do those exist at that point? Maybe my parents know someone who can, I don't know, fix my broken arm)

Come my 11-14 year old years, and I was ignored for the most basic of needs: attention, food, water, clothing, human interaction. My parents refused to buy me anything, feed me once a day, locked me in my room, yelled at me whenever I asked to see the light of day, and tortured me my mocking, mimicking, yelling, hitting, sending me to martial arts school (where the culture was alike to Neo-Sparta), telling me to clean the bathrooms, berating me for anything, calling me retarded, buying me clothes and then proceeding to tell me that I look like a homeless person (they bought me the only few clothes I have), and outright refusing any human decency in my life. Thanks mom and dad.

This pattern of emotional and literally physical attacks continued on throughout my life. I am 19 soon to be 20 now and I am locked in my room by my own parents. Except I have Internet now. For most of the my life, my parents locked me in my room and did not even allow me to go outside other than to go to school, where-in I was locked in a fascist-Neo-dictatorial charter school where saying ""Hello"" would render you in detention for 2 hours. Thanks mom and dad. That school was utterly useless, providing only the bare minimum of course load (English, low-level math). Also, thanks to my aunts and uncles, who unanimously agreed that everything in my life is my fault and that I should have owned up to it: I was kicked out of my house and left homeless for weeks at a time.

I made it into college, and I ended up with the most horrible people I have ever met (except my parents, brother, and father). They constantly raided my things, attacked me, yelled at me, woke me up at night every time I went to sleep, and basically were a lesser version of the assholes my parents were. They did a whole lot of other stuff.

I began suffering from a multitude of mental and physical health issues due to a lifetime of concussions, lacerations, arm-breaks, bone-breaks, mental abuse. One day, I couldn't take it anymore and started yelling, to which my parents threatened me with a knife. I ran away from home and called 911.

To my surprise, the police turned on me, saying that I was mentally retarded and sent me to a mental institution for 2 weeks, to which, to my surprise, the caretakers and people there were also My Parents 3.0 Reloaded. The police officers did not bother to think about what I was saying, and simply went straight to pen and paper to jot down the words ""autistic, needs help, mental hospital...""

The mental institution forced me to take medication, sat me for 2-3 hour sessions stating how mentally retarded I am and that I needed to take the medication or I wouldn't be released (by the way, the medication had horrible side effects.

They sent me to my primary hospital, to which the primary hospital also unanimously agreed with the police &amp; my parents that I needed mental help, except that their form of mental help was superficial therapy, 3000$+ dollars worth of treatment at a time, the acknowledgement that I am indeed mentally retarded to think that a physical threat on my life is something that is TO BE CONCERNED OF.

Previously, when I was on medication, my parents turned on me once again, and shoved pills down my throat ""because it was good for me"". Currently on break from university, after suffering bouts of nightmares, extreme physical pain, and being financially withdrawn by my own parents, I am planning on working in fast food for years just to have my own place where I won't be treated lower than an animal.

Currently, my parents continue to treat me like a dog, waking me up in the middle of the night whenever I go to sleep, with-holding food from me, yelling at me, refusing to listen to anything I say, father physically threatens me for whatever I do, continues to berate me, is the biggest pussy I have ever met (would do something horrible, and literally run away in his car). Oh yeah, and any family member KNOWS of the horrible sub-animal treatment I am going through, and refuses to acknowledge my existence. So yeah, thanks world.

So yeah, if you have any advice (other than calling 911, who are completely fucking useless and only want to send me to am mental hospital again, and other than reaching out to ""supposed relatives who can help me at all"", or ""start working"", which I am going to start working) to deal with my extreme physical ailments, mental abuse, and neo-Nazi-Spartan household living conditions, it would be a great help, since apparently even the cops won't help me.

TL;DR: My family are made up of horrible people. I was physically and mentally abused for 19 years and continue to receive more and more physical ailments due to worsening conditions. My father is a violent alcoholic who continues to hit and yell at me. My mother treats me less than an animal and refused to give me food when I was young. My brother steals from me and hits me as well. My extended family refuse to acknowledge me. The police, hospital, and mental institutions all acknowledge me as mentally retarded for looking after my own health after a physical threat with a weapon and seek to force treatment onto me. I am in financial, physical, and mental crisis. Therapy is superficial and there are not many options.

I know deep down inside she’s kindhearted and caring. She just doesn’t portray that nurturing side all that often due to the stress of just... everything. Understandable.

However, not to defend that behavior, I’ve noticed that she can be manipulative and emotionally abusive (only to me) and tried to push me into a corner where I start believing I’m the victim. She fails to explain how my actions were wrong and use certain phrases as verbal ammunition.

My life right now is in such a good place from where I used to be 4-5 years ago. I work two jobs that are furthering my career. I’m graduating soon. And I’m occasionally hanging out with my tight knit group of friends to keep my sanity. 

But being home... feels so restricting and dense. My mother doesn’t like the idea of me just going to a concert or staying over at a friend’s house. She doesn’t care to meet my friends. She doesn’t like my significant other (whom I’ve been with for a while now) solely based on looks. And I’ve postponed them meeting each other in fear of everything going south. She glorifies the idea of “respect me and I’ll respect you”, but badmouths me in front of my father and siblings if I do something slightly wrong. Maybe I’m just a piece of shit child? I really don’t know. I’m jealous of people that have loving homes whose parents are open-minded and patient. I’m jealous of those who can comfortably talk to their mother/parents about anything.

&amp;#x200B;

For reference here is everyone I'll be discussing:

Uncle as U. Uncle's Wife as UW. Dad as D. Mom as M. Brother as B. My Grandparents as GP. Uncle's Wife's Parents as UWP. Uncle's youngest kid as UYC, oldest as UOC. And finally Uncles' Wife's child as UWC

&amp;#x200B;

So for the past 5 years my Uncle has been married; both of them had been divorced and met up somewhere/somehow. Uncle had 2 kids (ages 11 and 16) and she had 1 aged 4 when they came together in union.

The issues in the family all regard UWC mostly. About UWC and UW: The child does not act his age at all, despite being 6 (almost 7), UW does NOT teach him how to behave/act in social settings, she started to teach him manners and how to be courteous only when around my side of the family, otherwise he is babied by UW's side of the family. To give you perspective of UW and how much she refuses to help her child grow up, she still has not stopped putting said child in diapers, not sure why but he just isn't ready and she won't usher in support to get him out of those. He possibly may suffer a condition and we (my side of the family) have all been cautious for his well being if he does have something going on, but she won't test him for anything as she sees nothing wrong. UWC also had tantrums that just come out of nowhere and are not easily stoppable and often never stop. I've also noticed he seems to stop a tantrum in mere seconds of getting what he wants, otherwise it just gets worse.

&amp;#x200B;

Given all that lets move on to the family drama that started it all 2 years later:

All was fine in the family up until about 6 months ago, back in late October/early November of 2018. It was a Saturday and my B, UYC and I were minding our own business in the living room at my grandparents house. I was on my PC doing college assignments while UYC was on my other device playing TS4, asking me questions about the game every now and then. My brother was watch some show on the tv. About 30 minutes later comes in UWC, who immediately comes over and sits down on the floor doing whatever and watching tv every now and then. A few minutes pass and UWC comes and sits next to me on the arm of the chair and watches me working on a Java test, and then starts telling me (and no, they were statements, not questions) to play Minecraft. I tell him ""I can't, I'm doing college assignments right now."" and he pauses and waits and then repeats the statement like nothing happened. This went on for about 5 minutes before he started to get flustered. He started to show signs he might start a tantrum soon, right next to me, and near my desktop PC which I use for literally anything you can think of. UYC, B and I were not in the mood for one of these tantrums and so B comes over and picks up UWC around his chest with both arms and gently pulls him away from my PC. UWC goes blitz, screaming as if he had been stabbed, crying profusely. Upon being set down on the floor, B let go and walked and sat back down on the couch. UWC then decides after screaming and crying, to faceplant into the floor from his position of standing up. This child legit just falls over onto the carpet like a tree being cut down. After laying there for a minute he ran off into the garage (where M, D, GP, U, and UW were) and goes and tattles on B for ""Pushing him into the ground"". Later he comes in with a big smile, taunts B by saying ""I told on you"". Not even 5 seconds later, UWC then dashes into B's lap at the exact moment B was moving his arms forward to stretch. UWC turns around and looks at B, turns towards the tv, starts crying and screaming and faceplants AGAIN. The 3 of us just watched him as we observed his \*idiotic\* actions before he ran off to go tattle again. This time UWC came back with UW and she didn't say anything. They sat on the ground together for a while and she brought out a laptop for him to play on. Well he doesn't know how to use computers and just screamed ""Come on!"" and grunting while aggressively handling/using the laptop. I was still taking that same test by this point and trying to help him, by verbal communication, how to use to laptop and UYC did the same by pausing her gameplay. UWC eventually leaves the room for good the rest of the night and everything goes smoothly.

&amp;#x200B;

A day later U or UW refuses to ask me or UYC about the incident and go directly to blaming my B for starting everything. U says that ""I don't need to ask my daughter (UYC) about this matter, she is only a kid.""

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a week later:

U and UW start to berate B calling him a Brute/Bully, they were used interchangeably from my understanding. M and D were not having any of it and lashed out at UW (the aggressor) and U (the follower) for not being there to watch their kid and handle the situation better. Fun fact: 2 weeks before this U and UWC joked with B about not being able to handle a 6 year old regarding another situation, everything was fine then of course unlike now. Back to the present. UW and U are calling my parents lazy about teaching my B and I how to act around children while my parents are reflecting those with statements and facts regarding how her child shouldn't be acting up like the way he did that evening. You get how adults vs adults arguments go.

&amp;#x200B;

December rolls by, it is the Christmas Eve party that my GP hold every year for around 30 years on the 24th. Family and friends come over and everything is jolly. My M and her sister and work friend are over drinking, others are drinking, others playing Billards and just relaxing. Eventually U,UW, and their children come along. UW (again aggresses the atmosphere) and heads directly towards M and the others to say hi and my M respectively doesn't try to aggravate the situation in her non-sober state. UYC  comes over to sit next to me and watch me mess around in Photoshop and laugh with me because it was acting up. U comes over and watches the same thing and starts small chatter with me, nothing unusual. UW goes around saying hi to other people for a while and then comes over the U and then look at each other with this stare and then both look over at my M. After 5 seconds U and UW looked at each other again and said ""Alright, let's go"". They left within 20 seconds (fastest they've ever left anywhere) and went back home I assume.

&amp;#x200B;

A week later:

It's now the New Years Eve party and the same suspects that attend the Christmas party are here as well. Everything is fine just as always. Except this time U, UW and children never show up, no contact, no excuses, nothing. At the party, D, M and friends, GP and I are talking about the situation regarding 'them', the ones not there. We had come to the conclusion that UW was showing signs of having a manipulative personality for trying to persuade U into acting on her behalf; granted they are married so things obvious to us are blinded on their end because of being in a marriage together.

&amp;#x200B;

January:

U tells UOC to ""Do not visit grandma's house without us there"" and UW starts to treat him like a second class member in his household. (Wow, its like we were right about being manipulative to a degree) By that I mean that his needs and such are still met but his opinions are not taken in for anything. They don't ask for his input for much and if they do, they just override it. UYC and UWC are glorified while UOC is ""metered"" on things he can do. UOC tells my GP and M ""They can stop me from seeing you all up until I'm 18. Then when I can do whatever I want."" My M and GP advise him to not do anything that might get himself punished.

&amp;#x200B;

March:

UOC turned 18, had a birthday while my parents were out on the country for vacation. They bought him a gift with a gift receipt incase he didn't want that one in particular. GP went to UOC's party and I had no idea of this as I was not invited, nor was my B. UWP were there from what I heard later on. GP gives UOC the gift my parents got him and his remarks about the gift and notecard that went along with it was ""This is very sentimental, I love it."", GP translated that to me and then parents when they got back.

&amp;#x200B;

Week later my UYC had a dance event that I went to because my GP (grandma only) wanted to not go alone. So I went to make her happy and to also see my cousin who I haven't seen in 3 months! We get there and we go in and see UYC already with her group practicing or stretching and she smiled so happily and we talked briefly and asked where she would be performing. We went to the performing area and found U, UW and UWC who seemed really happy there. They were very polite, didn't bring up drama or anything of the sort. While I am there I'm taking mental notes, like everything before this point, about their behavior. When I am there, their attitude seems more passive and not assertive for anything. They offer to buy me things like drinks or food and I declined as I'm full at this time, polite offer though. Again, no signs of drama here. GP and I eventually get a moment to talk with UYC and tell her what we think of her group performances, and all that nice stuff. Then she brings up how she misses seeing us so often. GP replies with how she never sees them as much because of the drama. UYC states ""Yeah, this \~drama\~ needs to stop."" Day passes by with nothing else notable.

&amp;#x200B;

And here we are now in the present of when I'm typing this. Tbh, I'm not sure if UWP know the situation at all, what would they think if they knew their child was splitting a family as such? I feel like I should do something to remedy this stuff as I sit in a neutral position since I technically am not associated on one or the other side; but, at the same time I don't wish to agitate anything past its current point. Everything U and UW do just seems to end up being blown up into something massive while never accepting the blame for who really is at fault for the ""origin"" incident.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel like I should put these here as its been building up for a while regarding what feels like an invading force in my family, so here starts the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reference here is everyone I&amp;#39;ll be discussing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncle as U. Uncle&amp;#39;s Wife as UW. Dad as D. Mom as M. Brother as B. My Grandparents as GP. Uncle&amp;#39;s Wife&amp;#39;s Parents as UWP. Uncle&amp;#39;s youngest kid as UYC, oldest as UOC. And finally Uncles&amp;#39; Wife&amp;#39;s child as UWC&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for the past 5 years my Uncle has been married; both of them had been divorced and met up somewhere/somehow. Uncle had 2 kids (ages 11 and 16) and she had 1 aged 4 when they came together in union.&lt;/p&gt;

Just before I start I would like to point out that this is my first time posting to reddit so bear with me. Also this is going be a long one....

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

I used to live a small town back in the day where we had our own apartment. It wasn't glamorous and definitely lacked in many ways. Each year during summer my family(me included) would go to the capital where we would enjoy our holiday time and at the begging of the school year we would again return to our small town. This will be important real soon. So my dad is employed in the government. He doesn't earn that much but we are middle to upper middle class so everything is good.

&amp;#x200B;

Act 1:

So about 5 years ago, my parents decided to move us to the capital seeing that it would be better for our prospects in terms of better education for me and my sister. That is when the trouble started. While my dad earns a relatively good wage he can rough on money. My mom knew that and would always deal with it without causing a big issue. This time it was different. The plan was that when we move my dad would sell the old apartment and buy a new one near our school but since the economy was not doing so well(Still is) he decided to wait a couple of months to sell the place. Meanwhile the family would live at my grandparent's place for the time being(dad's parents). This was fine until my dad began delaying the whole sale of the apartment. This started to create tension in the family which was only exasperated by my dad refusing to buy us essentials like supplies for school and such stating that ""it was too much"". 

&amp;#x200B;

The Big Reveal:

While all of this was going down, I had no idea things were that bad. My dad would sometimes complain about costs and this was nothing new. So imagine the horror I was in when one day after school I get to the apartment. And the first thing I hear are my parents arguing. This was no ordinary fight as well. Needless to say it wasn't a good position by any means. They argued and next thing you know we(my mom my sister and I) were in my mom's car heading to our grandmother's house(mom's mom). Again I hoped for the better just thinking that it would be temporary but to my disappointment I am writing this from my grandmother's house so nothing really changed since. 

&amp;#x200B;

Skipping over details, the last 5 years were hell filled with me trapped between their feuds. They don't talk to each other and would lay everything on me. Even talks about a monthly allowance would ultimately be left for me to open. I have picked myself up over the years but have never fully recovered. Depression and suicidal thoughts are a daily struggle and because of the stigma here I never had the chance to go to a therapist or any professional. It also doesn't help when your college depends on your parents as well. I am graduating this year and while things have somewhat settled the stress has taken its toll on me. Things can't go like this forever. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions are helpful and to be honest even venting about it here is a bit relaxing when you have always felt trapped in your own mind. Stay safe out there.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello there. Just before I start I would like to point out that this is my first time posting to reddit so bear with me.

&lt;p&gt;I used to live a small town back in the day where we had our own apartment. It wasn&amp;#39;t glamorous and definitely lacked in many ways. Each year during summer my family(me included) would go to the capital where we would enjoy our holiday time and at the begging of the school year we would again return to our small town. This will be important real soon. So my dad is employed in the government. He doesn&amp;#39;t earn that much but we are middle to upper middle class so everything is good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Act 1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So about 5 years ago, my parents decided to move us to the capital seeing that it would be better for our prospects in terms of better education for me and my sister. That is when the trouble started. While my dad earns a relatively good wage he can rough on money. My mom knew that and would always deal with it without causing a big issue. This time it was different. The plan was that when we move my dad would sell the old apartment and buy a new one near our school but since the economy was not doing so well(Still is) he decided to wait a couple of months to sell the place. Meanwhile the family would live at my grandparent&amp;#39;s place for the time being(dad&amp;#39;s parents). This was fine until my dad began delaying the whole sale of the apartment. This started to create tension in the family which was only exasperated by my dad refusing to buy us essentials like supplies for school and such stating that &amp;quot;it was too much&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Big Reveal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While all of this was going down, I had no idea things were that bad. My dad would sometimes complain about costs and this was nothing new. So imagine the horror I was in when one day after school I get to the apartment. And the first thing I hear are my parents arguing. This was no ordinary fight as well. Needless to say it wasn&amp;#39;t a good position by any means. They argued and next thing you know we(my mom my sister and I) were in my mom&amp;#39;s car heading to our grandmother&amp;#39;s house(mom&amp;#39;s mom). Again I hoped for the better just thinking that it would be temporary but to my disappointment I am writing this from my grandmother&amp;#39;s house so nothing really changed since. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skipping over details, the last 5 years were hell filled with me trapped between their feuds. They don&amp;#39;t talk to each other and would lay everything on me. Even talks about a monthly allowance would ultimately be left for me to open. I have picked myself up over the years but have never fully recovered. Depression and suicidal thoughts are a daily struggle and because of the stigma here I never had the chance to go to a therapist or any professional. It also doesn&amp;#39;t help when your college depends on your parents as well. I am graduating this year and while things have somewhat settled the stress has taken its toll on me. Things can&amp;#39;t go like this forever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions are helpful and to be honest even venting about it here is a bit relaxing when you have always felt trapped in your own mind. Stay safe out there.&lt;/p&gt;

Alright. My parents health is starting to concern me, especially my mother’s. Also i posted this is advice but no one helped. ANYWAYS

Let me give some quick background on myself. I’m the “health freak” of my family. I eat very healthy and make sure not to over or under eat. I’m an athlete so i take my food seriously and I don’t drink or smoke whatsoever. I believe i’m the most knowledgeable person in my family when it comes to health. (not saying this to sound narcissistic; i want my other family members to be as knowledgeable as i am)

Let’s start with my dad. He drinks...A LOT... and he has horrible sleep apnea and he smokes cigars occasionally. I think that he has somewhat of a drinking problem because he’s almost always tipsy I just haven’t started noticing it until now. He doesn’t go to the doctor or take care of himself properly and this is a huge problem that really bothers me especially because i’m so close with him. 

Now for my mom. I DO NOT want to sound like an asshole with this. My mother drinks a lot too and recently she’s been tapping into heavier drinks. but she also eats a lot and is very misguided with her nutrition. She eats “clean” but not in the right amounts and she has gained a lot of weight. I am very concerned about things like diabetes and heart disease. Even though she eats mostly healthy i’m just concerned with the limitations that her weight puts on her. 

She used to take medication which made her gain weight but then she went off and lost some. Then over the past 5 or so years she’s been gaining it steadily. I honestly think she also eats to cope because she eats a lot. 

I didn’t want to sound rude but I’m just so concerned and I love my parents so much. I don’t know if I should bring it up to them that their health could be deteriorating or what? And if I do bring something up how could i do it in the proper manner. I don’t want to do it “lightly” because these types of things aren’t light.

So I (20M) write fanfiction sometimes, and I enjoy doing it when I need to escape reality and live inside of my own head for awhile.

My parents know that I write fanfiction, and my dad (48M) follows me on FF.net. I never told him my username, but his job is an IT and he’s good with computers and stuff, so a while back he found my account and started reading my stories.

Since then, things have gone downhill. When we were in Georgia last year during summer vacation, and we just got done swimming and I was sitting in a lounge chair near the pool waiting for my family, when he came up to me and began demanding that I stop writing fics about depression and stuff because in his words, “no one actually makes real books and movies about that kind of thing.”

I tried to tell him that fan fiction is an entirely different thing than real published books, but I don’t think he understood because he just kept yelling at me in front of my family. (and in public, no less.)

And I also write smut occasionally, and he’s read some of it, and he has told me multiple times in the past how ‘sick and disgusting’ he thinks it is, which really hurts me whenever he says that, and makes me angry, too.

My smut is not just filthy dirty, it’s got love in there too, and reflects what I want in a relationship. Lots of cuddling and nuzzling and kissing, things that are in a very loving relationship.

Now I desperately want him to not read my stories anymore, and just recently I went into his account and made it so that he wasn’t following me anymore, and I’ve tried to get him banned from the site but nothing has happened. He still follows me somehow, and I don’t know what to do. The majority of my audience is on FF.net, and I don’t want to stop posting there, but as long as I do he’ll keep being notified by the site about any stories that I write.

He also doesn’t understand why I don’t just stop writing fan fiction and write original works, and he gets angry when I tell him I probably will never write original works because I don’t want to.

He says that he supports my work, but his actions say the opposite. He only has an account so that he can keep an eye on me and my stories, and whenever I post a new story he always says “so I see you posted another story.” And that annoys me so much cause I post rather frequently some days.

I also told him that I want to keep my writing separate from my real life, but he doesn’t listen and he continues saying things like “He posted another story today” to the rest of my family when we’re all eating dinner together and stuff, and it annoys the hell out of me and I want him to stop.

I’m afraid of confronting him about this agian because I know he will just get angry and yell at me agian, because he has serious anger issues and a very short fuse, and gets annoyed extremely easily.

Has been this was for as long as I've known her. Here's a list of some of the things she's done, if you feel like reading:

&amp;#x200B;

* back in the nineties she and her son used to steal food from stores to survive.
* she is in a feud with ALL her neighbors.
* whenever she would argue with neighbors, she would call my dad over and then he'd have to be the peacemaker between her and the neighbor.
* around 12 years ago her son (who is a grown man, but is mentally challenged and has a mind of a child) started breaking things in the house every time it would be raining outside because then he wouldn't be allowed to go out to ride his bike. My aunt, naturally, called my dad over when this happened.
* around that same time she claimed that a masked man had showed up at her house and started breaking things. There's a dude serving a sentence for it. However, I HIGHLY suspect it was my cousin, her son, who did that and she blamed it on someone else because she's also a notorious liar.
* whenever my grandma would give me money when I was a kid, my aunt would then demand that my grandma give her the same amount of money.
* one time she got into another fight with her neighbor so she called my dad and all three of them agreed to erect a fence between her and her neighbor's property. So my dad bought some wire and spent the entire afternoon making a fence out of it. Not long after that, my aunt tore the fence down because she, and I quote, ""changed her mind.""
* we used to own lots of chickens so we'd always have eggs and sometimes, when she would come over, my mom would pack her a bag of eggs to carry home as a gift. One time while visiting her, my mom and I were in her front yard and I smelled something bad. We looked down under some rubble and saw the eggs we'd given her days earlier thrown away there.
* sometimes when my dad would come over to visit her, she'd pretend she wasn't home.
* when one of her neighbors died and the house was empty for a few years, my aunt's son broke the windows on that house just because
* to spite her neighbors, she would throw shit (actual feces) outside her house on the road so the street would stink
* she has some catchphrases and also a tendency to shout them out randomly. Loudly. In public.
* she would shout out those catchphrases even when she'd visit my dad at work. My dad is a cop. She would embarrass him.
* my dad found out that whenever he had a few weeks off work my aunt would go to his work and then just sit in the waiting room on the bench for a while. She would have full knowledge of him having days off. She just came over anyway.
* when my mom was sick and dying of cancer, my aunt asked me ""Are you sad about your mom?"" and didn't see anything wrong or inappropriate with asking that. That, and other nasty comments she made, lead to me eventually snapping at her and stopping talking to her.
* one time, after that, my friend and I were in a cafe and my aunt and her son also happened to be there. My aunt started walking all around the cafe so she could look at my friend and me. Legit walking from one end to the other to watch us. She eventually sent a waiter our way with the offer of drinks. We declined, finished our drinks quickly, and left. As we were going out, she started calling my name. I ignored her
* one time, also post our feud, I had finished my doctor's appointment so I was heading to the bus station to go home. On my way there I passed a farmer's marker. My aunt was there and she followed me for a bit, but thankfully she gave up after a minute.
* a few weeks ago my friend and I were in town. We passed some cafe, and my aunt and her son happened to be there. My friend told me my aunt stared at us as we walked past.
* she is in a fued with every firewood seller in town. Every one of them is selling firewood that ""isn't good."" She'd gotten into arguments with them. She said one seller kept coming over to her house, making it look like he was harassing her, when actually she didn't pay him for the firewood and the man just wanted his money. She'd asked my dad to find her someone to sell her firewood, so he got her to buy from the same guy he buys from. That firewood also wasn't up to her standards, but thankfully she didn't fight with the guy.
* remember that empty house where her neighbor used to live? It was owned by the city, and the city eventually lent it to a new tennant, a family of three. My aunt caused a scene, claiming those people are drug addicts, punks, etc... and she didn't want them to live there. They now live there.
* she caused a scene when some city official came over and she chased him away with an axe. Then she went to the ER and claimed he'd attacked her and called the police. When the police officer came, he presumably saw through her bullshit, and she in turn verbally assaulted him, so she got arrested and spent 2 days in jail. She is currently on probation for that.
* my dad has had enough of being embarrassed of her at work, so about 6 months ago he stopped coming over. She still tried to call him and ask him to come over after arguing with neighbors, but he refused to go.
* two weeks ago she called him again, claiming her neighbor is ""following her."" My dad refused to go there and hung up.
* a few days after he hung up on her, he gets a letter from her lawyer. She is suing him for 50000 hrk, claiming she had been lending him 800 hrk EVERY SINGLE MONTH for the last 16 years. Which is a lie. He hadn't been borrowing money from her.
* my dad went to have a meeting with her lawyer. Apparently my aunt had heard that my dad got 50000 hrk as some sort of bonus or compensation or something from work and wanted him to pay back his debt to her. He has no debt to her. And he had gotten no money from work. If he had, he would've paid off his debts to the bank, but logic and my aunt are strangers. Someone had either lied to her, or she made it up herself just to get revenge on my dad for wanting nothing to do with her.
* my family used to live in an apartment building, but we moved away to where we live now in 2000. My dad recently saw a former neighbor of ours from the building, a man who also used to work with my dad, but it now retired. The man told him that a few weeks ago, before she sued my dad, my aunt came over to this dude's home when his wife was home and asked ""Where's my brother?"" We haven't lived in that building for 19 years, and my dad hadn't seen that man in a while. And also, my aunt knows where we live. She's been here a shitload of times.

&amp;#x200B;

So, yeah, she's fucking crazy. She's done more crazy things, but this is all I remember for now.

At this point I'm scared of being seen by her in public without either a witness or security camera to film the encounter. I don't want her to accuse me of something and report me to the cops or even sue me. I wouldn't put anything past her. When I was in high school, her son actually told my dad that I teased him and called him names at the bus station while I waiting for the bus home. The problem with that? I have never seen him at the bus station, AND he claimed this supposed encounter happened in the evening. My school was in the morning and the latest bus I ever took was at 2:20 PM. There was no way I was at the bus station in the evening. If he's pulled this shit then, he or she could do it again.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is my dad&amp;#39;s sister and she is bonkers.

&lt;li&gt;two weeks ago she called him again, claiming her neighbor is &amp;quot;following her.&amp;quot; My dad refused to go there and hung up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a few days after he hung up on her, he gets a letter from her lawyer. She is suing him for 50000 hrk, claiming she had been lending him 800 hrk EVERY SINGLE MONTH for the last 16 years. Which is a lie. He hadn&amp;#39;t been borrowing money from her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my dad went to have a meeting with her lawyer. Apparently my aunt had heard that my dad got 50000 hrk as some sort of bonus or compensation or something from work and wanted him to pay back his debt to her. He has no debt to her. And he had gotten no money from work. If he had, he would&amp;#39;ve paid off his debts to the bank, but logic and my aunt are strangers. Someone had either lied to her, or she made it up herself just to get revenge on my dad for wanting nothing to do with her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my family used to live in an apartment building, but we moved away to where we live now in 2000. My dad recently saw a former neighbor of ours from the building, a man who also used to work with my dad, but it now retired. The man told him that a few weeks ago, before she sued my dad, my aunt came over to this dude&amp;#39;s home when his wife was home and asked &amp;quot;Where&amp;#39;s my brother?&amp;quot; We haven&amp;#39;t lived in that building for 19 years, and my dad hadn&amp;#39;t seen that man in a while. And also, my aunt knows where we live. She&amp;#39;s been here a shitload of times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, yeah, she&amp;#39;s fucking crazy. She&amp;#39;s done more crazy things, but this is all I remember for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I&amp;#39;m scared of being seen by her in public without either a witness or security camera to film the encounter. I don&amp;#39;t want her to accuse me of something and report me to the cops or even sue me. I wouldn&amp;#39;t put anything past her. When I was in high school, her son actually told my dad that I teased him and called him names at the bus station while I waiting for the bus home. The problem with that? I have never seen him at the bus station, AND he claimed this supposed encounter happened in the evening. My school was in the morning and the latest bus I ever took was at 2:20 PM. There was no way I was at the bus station in the evening. If he&amp;#39;s pulled this shit then, he or she could do it again.&lt;/p&gt;

Just writing this post to look for people that went through the same experience I'm going through right now.

My grandpa turned 85 last July. He's had a lot of heart issues of the past 10 years and we even almost lost him to a heart attack about 9 years ago. He used to say ""Life is a battle, and I've fought mine. But I love life, I enjoy every second of it."". My grandpa and grandma live in the same house as my and my parents so we're very close. 

As a result from his weak heart he has to sleep with a C-pap every night. If he doesn't wear it, he stops breathing in his sleep which causes his heart to work overtime. This makes him very uncomfortable and tired during the day. He has also developed dementia over the years. He will be visiting a friend one moment, once he's home he won't remember where he was of what he did. 

My grandma(72), also his wife has been going through some serious medical problems lately. She's been in and out hospitals for the last few months. My grandpa has been by himself at home although his nurses come and take care of him twice a day, my family visits him 3 times a day, there's a caretaker that makes sure the house is weel kept and he regularly goes to ""daycare"" where he can connect with other people in the same situation as he is. (feeling lonely and suffering from dimentia)

Lately we've noticed that GP started skipping meals. He will only eat breakfast at 9 a.m. and maybe a slice of bread at noon. He's started to lose weight and we can tell he's weakened.

He won't wear his C-pap anymore. Even though he forgets a lot, he knows how dangerous it is for him to net wear his C-pap. My parents and I will put him to bed every night and make him wear it but once he's asleep (or maybe tricks us into thinking he's asleep) we leave. When we go check on him he'll have taken off his C-pap.

All of the above causes him to be extremely tired during the day. We can't even lift his head up to talk to someone. He'll just wake up, get ready for the day with his nurse, sit down in his chair and fall asleep.

We're all very worried about him. He can't enjoy hisofe anymore but we can't get him to understand that he needs to eat and wear his C-pap. We're afraid he's done with his life, like he doesn't even care anymore. We took him to a few doctors but they all told is that he's fine.

Anyone out there with he same issues? Please send me your best advice on how to make my grandpa clear that food.

He doesn’t talk to this at all to my sister and Is way nicer even though he was mean to her as well when she was younger till she went in her rebellious phase and got diagnosed with depression. Guess I got to develop some mental illness to get respect from him.

This story involves my cousin and uncle. 

My cousin, who we will call Chris, suffers from several mental illnesses. He is diagnosed bipolar, he has anger issues, anxiety, depression and possibly borderline personality disorder. But a lot of those tie in to one another. He is generally a troubled man, 22 years old now. He dabbles in several drugs, but only smokes weed consistently as far as I know. Fine by me, I like it myself.
It is speculated that in the past he has gone as far as to steal money from our family, for who knows what. 
He has friends over at family gatherings often, one of his friends was caught stealing our Uncle's wallet. The wallet was returned, no harm done. 

Dispite all of these things, Chris is a very sweet guy and kind. He's fun to be around, very different from when he was younger. When he was younger, he was quite an annoyance. But, frankly he drew the short straw being the oldest child in the family. All the attention was on his brother and other cousins including me. 

We'll call our uncle Carl. 

Maybe Carl saw how troubled Chris was and tried to help him out with music. Carl introduced several different bands and genres to Chris and it helped him massively. It was something that Chris could go to when he felt bad. Carl even encouraged Chris to learn to play the guitar, something Chris still plays. 
This meant the world to Chris, and Carl was a big influence on Chris. 

Fast forward to now.

Carl has left behind Chris and even trashes the bands he originally introduced to Chris. He has essentially lost all connection to Chris, maybe the wallet incident triggered it. 

It is important to mention, you don't have to worry about theft with Chris. I left $100 headphones in his room with 4 of his friends overnight. And they were in the same place in the morning. He is a normal person, not a thief. 

In my opinion, these days Chris is fun to be around. He isn't a pessimist anymore, he tries to talk about music to Carl to rekindle some connection. But, Carl shuts him down every time. 

I personally have a good connection with both Carl and Chris. Chris isn't a big fan of the rest of the family at this point, except for a few. I am one of those few, possibly because I am not a judgemental asshole. I talk to Carl almost every night while playing PS4. We talk about his new baby, who I am in love with. He is just a ball of fun. So Carl and I are good friends. 

But, it has been weighing on me the past couple of months: Why does Carl dislike Chris so much? Why can't he be the nice, friendly guy he is to everyone else? Well, my conclusion is that Carl is just a flawed man. He can't let go of a grudge and let the new and improved Chris back into his life. It is a wholesome thought, Chris and Carl being good friends again, but it isn't happening. 

Tonight: 
Tonight I was talking to Carl like usual, playing The Division 2. We got to talking about family and I mentioned a funny conversation I had with Chris. My brother, who was also in the chat, starts laughing because it was a funny story. Chris is funny. But Carl is Carl. Carl says, ""Chris is kind of just an abomination of a human being, isn't he?"" (While laughing). Me and my brother go silent and just continue the conversation after an awkward few seconds. 

Fucking bizarre, right? Typing it out made it even more weird for me. 
Anyways, that's the story. What do you guys think?

And before I truly begin this I don't want to seem like one of those ungrateful brats so I want to say I truly appreciate what my parents do and provide for me but at the same time I just can't take it anymore.

 I'm a pretty independent person and I have a small circle of friends and personally I think there's nothing wrong with that. My dad on the other hand is always saying get some friends and complaining I never do anything. I have one friend I go to all the time who lives close by and he's my best friend. Anyways, my dad is always saying I never do anything and that I need to join something at school despite already being in multiple sports and I find myself at home by myself a lot and he says get out and literally yells at me to do something. 

I feel like I already do enough. I work and do school and hang out with my one friend every once and awhile. My dad has gotten even more verbally abusive as of late saying I'm a loser and I need more friends. I wanna say right that I don't have a lot of friends and I don't really want more because personally I don't like anyone and it's not even me just being inconsiderate. It's the thing that literally everyone at my school is into drugs and parties and mischief and I'm just not ik some people will call me a pussy but IDC I like being comfortable. 

So my dad is constantly trying to set me up saying oh go out with so and so's son and meanwhile their son I already know and he's a weed dealer and ik my dad hates that so he's oblivious. Then there are some kids who are good but their personalities are just so off from mine we wouldn't make good friends. I've gotten into physical arguments with my dad over shit. He thinks I have no plan in life and I really don't but I'm just being me. 

Then there is my mom. So here I go actually hanging out with someone and it's my one friend and I'll go over and my mom asks so many questions about what I'm doing as if she thinks I'm a criminal. I'll say I'm going over to my friends and she'll say that she might come over at 1 am to make sure I'm where I'm supposed to be. Once I went over there without telling her I was staying the night bc I wasn't planning on it but I accidentally fell asleep and she pounds on my friends door at 2 am. She's always being over invasive and then wonders why I never go anywhere as well.

My parents also have a lot of dumb policies and just think that I have to be a blue collared worker in order to have a successful life but at this point I just want to do what I'm comfortable with. I'm always being compared to my siblings and I am just ready to get out.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 17.. I&amp;#39;m the oldest of 3 kids.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a pretty independent person and I have a small circle of friends and personally I think there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with that. My dad on the other hand is always saying get some friends and complaining I never do anything. I have one friend I go to all the time who lives close by and he&amp;#39;s my best friend. Anyways, my dad is always saying I never do anything and that I need to join something at school despite already being in multiple sports and I find myself at home by myself a lot and he says get out and literally yells at me to do something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I already do enough. I work and do school and hang out with my one friend every once and awhile. My dad has gotten even more verbally abusive as of late saying I&amp;#39;m a loser and I need more friends. I wanna say right that I don&amp;#39;t have a lot of friends and I don&amp;#39;t really want more because personally I don&amp;#39;t like anyone and it&amp;#39;s not even me just being inconsiderate. It&amp;#39;s the thing that literally everyone at my school is into drugs and parties and mischief and I&amp;#39;m just not ik some people will call me a pussy but IDC I like being comfortable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my dad is constantly trying to set me up saying oh go out with so and so&amp;#39;s son and meanwhile their son I already know and he&amp;#39;s a weed dealer and ik my dad hates that so he&amp;#39;s oblivious. Then there are some kids who are good but their personalities are just so off from mine we wouldn&amp;#39;t make good friends. I&amp;#39;ve gotten into physical arguments with my dad over shit. He thinks I have no plan in life and I really don&amp;#39;t but I&amp;#39;m just being me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is my mom. So here I go actually hanging out with someone and it&amp;#39;s my one friend and I&amp;#39;ll go over and my mom asks so many questions about what I&amp;#39;m doing as if she thinks I&amp;#39;m a criminal. I&amp;#39;ll say I&amp;#39;m going over to my friends and she&amp;#39;ll say that she might come over at 1 am to make sure I&amp;#39;m where I&amp;#39;m supposed to be. Once I went over there without telling her I was staying the night bc I wasn&amp;#39;t planning on it but I accidentally fell asleep and she pounds on my friends door at 2 am. She&amp;#39;s always being over invasive and then wonders why I never go anywhere as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents also have a lot of dumb policies and just think that I have to be a blue collared worker in order to have a successful life but at this point I just want to do what I&amp;#39;m comfortable with. I&amp;#39;m always being compared to my siblings and I am just ready to get out.&lt;/p&gt;

You can have all the preferences you want in a potential date's family, just don't assume that the person will be like their family. It is like saying that people are destined to be repeats of each other. It makes no sense. And here is why:

If you look back at history: a lot of American southern white people have ancestors who used to be slave owners. This does not mean they are racist. A lot of them are extremely ashamed of it and would never mention it. It's unthinkable. Some people have ancestors who were criminals or in the mafia. This does not mean that they are criminals or in the mafia. Some people have relatives who are hicks. This does not mean that they are hicks. Some people have relatives who are alcoholics. This does not mean that they are alcoholics. Some people have relatives who are intensely smart and have a net worth of billions of dollars. This does not mean that they have net worths of billions of dollars. Some people have families who have family businesses. This does not mean that they decided to be apart of the family business. People do not always follow the upbringing of their family.

A couple of decades ago people used to judge kids who had divorced parents. ""Don't marry a kid from a divorced family as that will end up being the two of you!"" Now people have moved on and realized how ridiculous that is. I wish that people could also realize this about kids from abusive families. I find it really stereotyping and trapping to hear this.

I once had a guy friend who was really interested in me. He was a good guy with a good family. I knew him for a long time before I told him about my family (I've found this to be the best way to deal with this societal stereotype). Because of how nice I was, he couldn't even imagine that my family was so horrible to me. He tried to brush it off as ""typical teenager and parent arguments"" because the concept made 0 sense to him. He knew I wasn't making it up but it also didn't register in his mind because he thought that how someone acted must be how their parents acted and visa versa. Needless to say, I never dated him because I knew he had this mindset and I didn't want us possibly having a future and him blindly involving us with my narcissistic parents.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I went to a shopping centre with my best friend. We went to the ice cream store that my dad owns, Baskin Robbins, and my friend wanted to get an ice cream. She's anaphylactic, so when she was getting it, she asked the person to sterilise the scoop (there's a procedure for sterilising the scoop that my dad taught me specifically to do if someone asks us to, and he said that that's the only way to do it, no other way is acceptable). So the guy said he'd sterilise it, but when he gave her the ice cream, she told me that he'd only run it under boiling hot water. Because of what my dad had said (""there's a specific way to sterilise the scoop, and you have to do it that way""), I assumed that it was wrong, and I asked him how he'd sterilised it and whether he'd done all the sterilising steps that my dad had shown me, and he said that the way he'd done it was okay. Still, my friend was nervous to eat it, for obvious reasons, so I went outside and called my dad just to check what was going on. He said that the way that guy had done it was okay, but that he'd call him and ask him to sterilise the scoop the way that I'd been taught so that my friend would feel more comfortable eating it. So we waited for two minutes outside like my dad had told us to, and then when the guy who was working waved us over, we went back in. He sterilised the scoop the way that my dad told us to, and gave us the ice cream.

&amp;#x200B;

Now onto the main part of the story, the part that this question is about.

&amp;#x200B;

When my mum picked me up, she started yelling at me as soon as I closed the door of the car for calling my dad, because according to her, I shouldn't have called him, and that I should've let it be when my dad said that it was okay. She said that it lowers the morale of staff, while also yelling at me and calling me an idiot, stupid, dumb, all that. She told me that I should've told him (the staff member who served us, I won't say his name) myself that I wanted it to be more sterilised, which I'd done and he said that it didn't need to, hence why I called my dad. I don't think it was a big deal, and I think that my mum's overreacting, but I'd love to hear other people's opinions on this.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, side note, I also asked my dad to pick me up at 7:00 p.m. yesterday from that shopping centre, but at 6:30 p.m., he and the rest of the family drove out somewhere *really* far from the shopping centre to have dinner, and I got yelled at yet again, because my dad said I'd never said 7:00 p.m., but I asked my friend what time I'd asked my dad to pick me up, and she said that I had said 7.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet another side note, and kind of unrelated, but me and my friends playfully punch each other on the shoulder sometimes, and yesterday, my friend brought her hand too close to my head/face and I flinched, and she noticed. She asked me why I flinched, and if I thought that she was going to hit me, and *why* I thought that. Should I tell her the reason (my dad used to slap me all the time, and he punched me once)? It hasn't happened in a while, but it still freaks me out when people bring their hands too close to my face.

&amp;#x200B;

I could use a little advice from the lovely internet. Name changes ahead. 

A little backstory: I’m the middle child of 5 daughters. My eldest sister, Joy, is bipolar. (Think of Carrie from Homeland.) Joy was with her high school sweetheart for 6 years. He stayed with her through Suicide attempts, cheating, etc. You name it. One of the big things she does though is hold grudges. 

Story:

So Mid- February 2018 her high school sweetheart proposed to her, and she accepted. She was thrilled.  Then the first week of March she comes to my house, and is telling me how emotionally abusive he is. She cringes when he touches her. So I support the decision to leave him. 

And then her high school finds her meds while he’s packing. She hasn’t been taking them for at least a month when he found them. Then he discovers she’s been cheating on him with another guy again. So high school sweetheart messages me out of worry for her, and heads back across the country to his home.

I confronted her about this. I asked her if there was someone else. She denied it. So I left it alone.But then she starts bringing new guy, Dale, around the family more and more within the days after her high school sweetheart left, and they start a relationship.

In April, she stops by my house crying because the parents of her new guy don’t like her. Dale’a parents are very religious conservative Catholics. They don’t like her tattoos. They don’t like her manners. And she’s not the girl they picked out for him. She’s 6 years his senior, and he has a curfew at 19 years old. So his mom did some digging on her, and found out that she accepted someone else’s engagement while taking her sons virtue, and confronts them both. His dad is livid. He tells Dale that he’s embarrassed he raised a son that disrespected another man etc. I comfort her, but tell her to own up to what she did, and that she had no business lying to me before, but things would work out.

And I thought things were okay until I found out that she blocked me on every social media there is. She blocked my number. Everything. I found out through my mom that Joy was mad at me because I called her out on her lying. So I give her some time. 

Skip ahead to August, nothing. I wrote a letter to have my mom give her, apologizing for hurting her feelings. No response.

Skip ahead to November, I saw her at Thanksgiving, I verbally apologize and say I miss her. She accepts, but I stay blocked.

Skip ahead to December. I finally meet Dale. He proposed, she accepted. I hug and congratulate him, as I’m leaving my moms. Still blocked. Christmas shows up, I bring gifts for the both of them, write her a long letter apologizing for the 3rd time. Lots of tears and hugging. Still blocked .

Skip ahead to January 2019. My mom is telling me about a meet the two family dinner for them. I’m invited by my mom.  Still blocked. 24 hours to the dinner, Dale invites me to the dinner. Still blocked. I chose to not go because she still hasn’t unblocked me and invited me herself. 

This decision gets me disowned by the family. I told my mom I had to work, which was true, and my mom flipped out. (My mom is a whole separate story.) Essentially I’m an awful person for not going and I’m going to regret putting work before family. At this point, I have mini breakdown and delete all of my social media for a long time.

Which brings us to today. My baby sister just called me to let me know the wedding is tomorrow at 5pm. Joy wants me to go. (Who has a wedding on a Friday?)

I’m really hurt by my sister. I feel like this grudge has gone too far, and I’m done. But out of respect, I feel I have to go. If I don’t, I’m ruining any chance of salvaging the relationship.

But I haven’t spoken to any of my family in 3 months. I’ve lost 20lbs, I’m happy. I go to school and work full time. I have my own very happy and healthy relationship of 4 years. And honestly, that’s doing much better because I’m not constantly stressing over my mom or my sister. 

I feel like my family is so toxic, but it’s my family...there’s no going back if I don’t go. I honestly feel like I got the 24 hour heads up because it’s a show for his family. 

Advice, please. Anyone?

He's a nice guy and he never hurt me, but he's one of those people that yells when he gets mad. I always hated it so much. But it was very rare that he'd yell *at me*, you know?

He&amp;#39;s a nice guy and he never hurt me, but he&amp;#39;s one of those people that yells when he gets mad. I always hated it so much.

First post here.
I'm in a hard situation here and could use some advice.
So my 15 (almost 16) year old sister wants to live with me.
She is a bit troubled (has already had an abortion, is drinking and taking drugs, and barely goes to school). She is an all round wild child who doesn't like to follow rules. She wants to be treated as an adult, but yet takes no responsibility for her own life and actions. 

Our mum passed away about a year ago, and she doesn't get along well with her father (we have different dads, but the same mum). 
We have other family members she could stay with, but chooses not to as she doesn't like their rules.
She has asked to live with me and my partner. My partner doesn't want her to live with us, as we feel she would bring a lot of trouble (including trouble with the law). 
I am 22 and I work in the law enforcement field, so I cannot associate with anyone in trouble with the law, as I would loose my job.
I am just starting out my life and my career. My parter and I want to have the freedom to holiday, have children and such, but fear we would have to put that on the back burner.
We are worried that my sister (or her druggy friends that are in and out of prison), will trash our house and bring trouble.
I'm not sure I have the maturity and the emotional capability to take my sister on.
I have a friend that has a spare room at her house and had offered to rent it to my sister.
I am wondering if that would be an okay option for her? I would go over weekly and check in, and still provide her with as much help and support as I can.

Has anyone been in a similar situation, or does anyone have any advice? 

Ps: we have already taken her on once when my mum first passed away. She said she wanted to come and live with us. So we went out and bought her a brand new bed, did up a room on the house for her, bought her a new wardrobe of clothes, make up, toiletries, the whole lot. After about a week and a half she decided she did not want to live with us anymore because her friends lived too far away. So she took most of what we bought her and left.
So I am worried that will happen again, and she will just take advantage of us. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi! First post here.

Together with a group of friends and friends of friends, we decided to go on a trip together abroad. There were mainly couples, only I and one of my other friend (a girl) were singles. In that trip I met my current husband and we are happily married for 4 years now, and have been blessed with a lovely baby soon to be 1 yr old. Back then my husband was in a relationship with a girl for about 6 months. There were seeing each other on and off in order to solve eachother needs. It was mostly a ""friends-with- benefits"" relationship. After we came back from the trip, they agreed on taking on separate ways and soon after he asked me out, and therefore we ended up to marry one another.

One of the girls from the other couples, which back at in that time was my husband's best friend, didn't quite agree with his decision. She liked the other girl more, and ALL THE TIME when she was meeting with my husband, out of pure coincidence his ex would join their meeting. That happened many times, it didn't matter if it was just for a coffee, or clubbing, she would find a way to bring them together. Most of these meetings would have happened when I was out of town or country due to work. Not to mention that she was basically trying to put fights against me and my girl friends, on reasons that didn't exist, just because this is her style. You would say that I might have done something to her, but believe me, I never did, I hate conflicts and tensions and I prefer peace rather than to fight for my pride.

Luckily we have moved abroad after a year of relationship, and we have never been happier. My sister in law (my husband's brother girlfriend) she is also very good friends with my husband's ex.

Now here it comes. After 6 years of living abroad, my husband's best friend reached out to him that she'd like to visit us, plus the country where we live in now, together with her husband and her baby. Of course he couldn't say no. I heard a rumour in our group of friends, that my sister in law is going to have a guest soon, and guess who that might be - my husband's ex. It is a coincidence that most likely she is going to come when my husband's best friend is visiting us?

If this happens, I really don't know how to manage the situation. Like even here this woman is trying to create some circus and shitty situations for her own entertainment? What would you do if you were me? 

Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against my husband's ex, because in the end she didn't do anything. On the contrary, she was kinda left for someone else... 

But it really irritates me this whole orchestration, when in the end I don't know what she'd like to achieve. I am in a really good place with my husband and at least at this point I know he's not interested in anybody else and he values family very much. But is soooooo annoying when some people want to grab a pop corn and watch the show the create.

[ Edit: I'm a girl ]

[ Edit 2: My dad is concerned for us but he's not willing to walk the extra mile. He cares about me and my brothers and my mom but the way he is, is creating a blackhole and I want to stop that before it's too late] 


The root of all the problems is that my dad is not interested in anything my younger brothers do until it comes to their studies/religion. They're all under the age of 12. 

My mom is constantly worn out. She works as a teacher to get us to study in the best school (as they lower the fee of a teachers child). She wakes up 5 am and goes to sleep 11-12 am. She mostly doesn't get good enough sleep because my youngest brother still wont sleep without her and although hes small for his age, the bed still isn't big enough for three in my parents room. 

Half of her marriage has been my dad abusing her in some way. Mentally, physically: in the beginning they would argue over small things because they had very different povs on life and my dad couldn't accept she had different views than her, so it would be a rollercoaster. Then it became physical. Then it became a mix. Most of the mental abuse was that he would doubt her loyalty, call her and her family names. 

She would stand up Everytime her family's name came up. My mom's side is actually pretty sweet as compared to my dad's. Their so, extremist and it seems like they're from the 1800's. 

Live in the Asian subcontinent so no, no therapy no social services or no telling anyone else. 

I'm in AS/junior year right now, and I want to know if I can do anything to fix my house. 

My younger brothers have become one of the snobbiest, brattiest, bad mouthed, careless, reckless, disobedient and misbehaving kids I've known.

It's gotten worse over the past year. 

I don't know what to do. 

My brothers are nice to my mom but the bratty part, like when asked to do something the first answer is always ""no"", is always there. 

Towards my dad they're nice too. My dad's become better when it comes to being abusive and toxic but his disinterest in things that he should engage in his own and my brothers' lives is causing most of the issues. 

They're growing up now and he's the role model. He doesn't have a job, he buys land sells it at a profit later and we get enough money for the month plus my mom's savings.  

It's effected my studies alot but Everytime I say that it's like one day it's fixed and the next it's back to that. Also he then says it's moms fault for not giving them the right upbringing so I don't even say it most of the time.

 my dad is also super strict so i decided this year not to even ask him to go out anywhere and that's caused me to change from a very social person to a lonely and antisocial person. 

No I can't seek a therapist. No I can't talk directly it won't change anything. 
No divorce isn't an option. My mom's dedicated her life to us, but it's been taking a toll on her for the past couple of years. She's become so irritated she's just ready to shut you down or become negative. She wasn't like this. I miss her. I miss my mom. 

Please can anyone help. Ask anything you need to know to help the situation more 






TLDR; My dad's disinterest in general things in life is causing our family to fall apart. Please advice on how I can fix this. 
","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;{Long post; TLDR in the bottom}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ Edit: I&amp;#39;m a girl ]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ Edit 2: My dad is concerned for us but he&amp;#39;s not willing to walk the extra mile. He cares about me and my brothers and my mom but the way he is, is creating a blackhole and I want to stop that before it&amp;#39;s too late] &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The root of all the problems is that my dad is not interested in anything my younger brothers do until it comes to their studies/religion. They&amp;#39;re all under the age of 12. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom is constantly worn out. She works as a teacher to get us to study in the best school (as they lower the fee of a teachers child). She wakes up 5 am and goes to sleep 11-12 am. She mostly doesn&amp;#39;t get good enough sleep because my youngest brother still wont sleep without her and although hes small for his age, the bed still isn&amp;#39;t big enough for three in my parents room. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half of her marriage has been my dad abusing her in some way. Mentally, physically: in the beginning they would argue over small things because they had very different povs on life and my dad couldn&amp;#39;t accept she had different views than her, so it would be a rollercoaster. Then it became physical. Then it became a mix. Most of the mental abuse was that he would doubt her loyalty, call her and her family names. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She would stand up Everytime her family&amp;#39;s name came up. My mom&amp;#39;s side is actually pretty sweet as compared to my dad&amp;#39;s. Their so, extremist and it seems like they&amp;#39;re from the 1800&amp;#39;s. &lt;/p&gt;

We both live with our parents. Last month my sister started this keto diet where you eat lots of fat, protein and no carbs. She also decided to do one meal a day. My dad and I sat on the dinner table trying to talk her out of it. My sister said that this is how we're supposed to eat because that's how our ancestors ate when they had to hunt for food. She insisted this diet helps her concentrate and stuff. My mom didn't know what was going on so she defended my sister, since my sister cooks for herself and eats healthy. The next day my mom found out that my sister only wanted to eat once a day and thought this was a stupid idea. I did my own research on this. There is actually a sub r/OMAD for people who only eat once a day. I was shocked people do this. I did some more research and found out your body needs carbs for energy, and the keto diet is helpful to those with a sedentry lifestyle. My sister still excercises actual workouts. Honestly I cannot stand watching her excercise since her carb intake is not proportionate to her excercise. She said the main reason she excercises is to lose weight but also to not get bored. She is already skinny and doesn't need to lose weight. But she says if she is at a certain weight people stare at her and she doesn't like that. My sister is very self concious. In elementary school a girl told her she was skinny so she ate a lot of bread to gain weight. Last summer I was exiting the board walk and saw her entering the boardwalk with sneakers. I asked why is she wearing sneakers in the summer. She said that girls who go to the beach often get their toes pedicured and painted, and she's embarrassed she didn't get her toe nails done. I told her no one is looking at her toe nails, they are just walking and talking. She said she knows and acknowledges this is her problem. She eats spinach wich the supermarket doesn't sell in smaller quantities. So she asks me to eat her spinach. Last week I told her no with an ""attitude"" and she got mad. I said sorry that day. She still wouldn't talk to me. She hasn't spoken to me all week over this. There was another time she brought up a topic I didn't want to bring up, so she got mad and didn't speak to me for weeks. My sister does have anger issues but lately seems more agitated than usual. She does acknowledge she has an eating disorder, not because of the keto diet, but the losing weight part. There was a time period where she involuntary vomited and it was resolved with medication. Then she purposefully made herself vomit after eating over certain amounts. I understand an eating disorder is involuntary. I had mental health problems myself. So far everyone in her life is against this diet, my friends and even her friends. My sister and I had a great relationship before the spinach incident. I cannot stand her now. She gets mad when people assume things. She asked dad if he can take a day off work to drive her to the appointment. NYC has public transportation but she needs to go to college on time. Dad told her he cannot take a day off work for this. My sister was mad my dad ""assumed"" he had to do it and yelled at him that he didn't have to.

My sister does have anger issues but lately seems more agitated than usual. She does acknowledge she has an eating disorder, not because of the keto diet, but the losing weight part. There was a time period where she involuntary vomited and it was resolved with medication. Then she purposefully made herself vomit after eating over certain amounts. I understand an eating disorder is involuntary. I had mental health problems myself. So far everyone in her life is against this diet, my friends and even her friends. My sister and I had a great relationship before the spinach incident. I cannot stand her now. She gets mad when people assume things. She asked dad if he can take a day off work to drive her to the appointment. NYC has public transportation but she needs to go to college on time. Dad told her he cannot take a day off work for this. My sister was mad my dad &amp;quot;assumed&amp;quot; he had to do it and yelled at him that he didn&amp;#39;t have to. Hopefully when I get a job I will be able to move away from her.&lt;/p&gt;

I have 5 younger brothers, ranging from ages 12-24, and one older sister. I love my family incredibly and I remember my upbringing fondly. Within this past year a rift has formed within my family. My family has of course had fights and siblings not getting along with each other, etc. what I thought to be relatively normal large family issues, but this rift has spiraled into something I didn't think that would ever happen with my family and frankly I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me provide a little background about my family before I delve into the core issue.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom and dad's relationship is no where near perfect and I fully acknowledge that there have been several occasions that are not considered functional and healthy. Their relationship did not start out well, my dad used to be an alcoholic and my mom swears by moments throughout the start of their relationship that have damaged her as a woman for the rest of her life. My dad is terrible at planning things, birthdays, Christmas, etc. and he wasn't necessarily super close to his eldest three children. This resulted in my mom being the one to buy all of the presents and plan parties, outings as a family, time spent as a family, budget money-essentially being the main parent to raise us. I wouldn't go as far to say that my dad was nonexistent because he was always there, he just didn't put as much effort into raising us as my mom did. I always chucked it out to be that deep down they love each other and us kids enough that they would always work it out. This saddens me greatly, but to this day they manage to work things out between each other no matter what happened between them and I still care about them and love them very much.

&amp;#x200B;

About a year ago, my mom and dad hit rock bottom in their relationship to the point where my dad threatened to leave my mom. Apparently this has happened before, but this time he was very serious about it. Yet, like always they managed to patch it up, and work it out enough to function with each other around my family. This left a scar on me, but it definitely impacted some of my siblings enough to warrant them wanting a family intervention where we would tell my parents about how, not only, this instance has impacted us, but throughout our upbringing as well. (They also wanted to address a matter involving my mom tracking my siblings internet presence because she caught my youngest siblings watching porn. This is something I did not agree with and did want to voice my opinion on. I do, however, understand why she did this and believe parents can make mistakes. She was juggling several younger children watching porn and trying to teach them healthy ways of expressing sexual urges with the best of her knowledge without the help of my father. )

&amp;#x200B;

I will admit I am a very positive person, now and when I was a kid, and even if I was bothered by events growing up, they did not impact me enough to affect my life in a negative way and have any reason for me to speak at this intervention. I did agree to listening in on the meeting because I wanted to make sure I was at least aware of everything that was said. I am the only one out of my siblings that lives out of state, and unfortunately I have to make more of an effort to keep in contact with my siblings. Information is usually heard one sided or not at all and I am left out of things, so for this supposed important family meeting I wanted to hear things directly, and attempt to be a mediator/retain a neutral stance on everything.

&amp;#x200B;

It did not go as it should have gone. At all. Not in any constructive way that an intervention I thought was supposed to be. Instead of my siblings speaking to BOTH of my parents about how their issues within their relationship has affected them, it instead turned it into a meeting about how my mom failed raising my siblings growing up and how she is now failing my younger brothers. My eldest sister is better with words and she communicated effectively how she was feeling. The eldest of my brothers states how he is feeling in a very brutal and non-constructive manner, on the constant attack.

&amp;#x200B;

My eldest sister is a passionate woman who I have always looked up to as a leader, and still do. Growing up she struggled with overeating and being overweight. The eldest of my brothers, who was my video game companion and the brother I butted heads with the most, was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis at a young age, and depression when he was older. As far as I was and am concerned, my mom did the very best she possibly could to raise us all and did so lovingly in equal capacity to us all. This meeting did not shatter my belief in that, but shattered my family, especially my mother. My mom is a very passionate woman as well and if I had to pick two of my siblings that she could be compared to the most, it was my sister, and the eldest of my brothers. Unfortunately this does not bode well when being confronted. My mom could not take the information my siblings were hitting her with and I could not believe the information that was being said by my siblings. Eventually my brother-in-law took me into another room with my other brothers, and him and I talked about everything going on and being spoken about as the shouting and crying got louder in the other room. I did not get to hear the rest of the meeting and frankly I couldn't handle it emotionally.

&amp;#x200B;

This would not be the end of it, and it still has not ended. Every time I spoke to my mom in the months following the meeting, I could not (and hardly cannot) get through a conversation without her crying her heart out. This still haunts and hurts me to this day. I also set up separate times to speak to my siblings individually to hear their say. I am very partial to my mother, and as much as I didn't agree with what my siblings were saying about her, I didn't want to disregard their feelings and experiences because frankly, I am not them. I have an easier time talking with my sister, and while I did not agree with all of her reasons, I made a strong effort to understand them without it impacting my thoughts towards my mom. She believes that my mom always treats her as a child, not a woman. She believes that my mom undermines her opinions because she is viewed as my mother's child, and not as a women with a masters degree in psychology and children's studies, and therefore not taken seriously. She believes that my mom disregards her opinions because she is not a parent, and makes her feel guilty for not yet having children. She also believes that growing up my mom was always aware of her weight, making her feel guilty of it, and instilling dieting habits even though she was a child. My brother I have a harder time speaking to. Since he is always on the attack and harsh with his words, anytime in the past I have spoken my opinions, they are usually shot down and disregarded and I am left feeling empty and at a loss for words. He believes my mom is the cause behind why his health conditions got to the degree that he did. He believes that she disregarded the pain he had as a child. He believes that she put a label on his behavior, him being negative and unappreciative, and thus caused his siblings to view him as such, and not as a role model. He believes that she favored everyone but him and disregarded his wishes, especially when it came to gift-giving. He truly believes my mom is a terrible mother. At the time, I asked them both what it would take to have this end. They both said they want my mom to see a counselor for both herself and my father and for my mom to take full responsibility for everything they told me.

&amp;#x200B;

This was months ago. Since then, my family has only broken more. Any time my family makes a decision, ANY decision, if they find some aspect they disagree with, they blame my mom. (My FAMILY bought a puppy a few months back even though they couldn't necessarily afford it, and they immediately threw hateful, disagreeable words at my mom, even though I was told my DAD wanted to get him.) And unfortunately it has caused my mom to feel betrayed if we have conversations with our siblings, in fear that we are talking bad about her, and has made her want to read everyone's text messages including my fathers. Thankfully this fear has calmed down.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom has attempted several times to speak to them and resolve the matter (and even going to start marriage counseling with my dad) though her approach does not settle well with them, and thus they retaliate. She is firm on her belief that she has raised them and done everything for them in the best way she could physically, emotionally, and mentally, she thinks she should not be blamed for these accusations and thinks that it is disrespectful for her children to treat her in this manner. My siblings are now constantly on the attack and are resolute in what they said and will not see my mom's reasoning and attempts at resolving the issue. Over time, my mom has softened and has simply just tried to get together with them. No matter how she words her sentences, or how she carefully words what she says, they find something they dislike about it, shut her down, and disregard that my mom even tried. They are not willing to forgive, and are unwilling to compromise. My mom as well. They now hardly talk and see each other.

&amp;#x200B;

Now in more recent months, something even more distasteful has formed. My eldest and elder sibling use my younger siblings to stay connected with the family and completely have removed my parents from the equation. I understand they do not want to ostracize themselves from my other siblings and I think on a deeper level, they do not want to be ostracized from my parents. They convince my siblings to come over without telling my parents to give them a safe space to vent and talk about how things are going at home. They text them asking if my parents are home, and if they are not, go over to my family home and spend time with my siblings. They ask my siblings about their band competition and show up and sit with my parents, but hardly talk to them or keep very light conversation. I get a bad taste in my mouth. I appreciate my siblings giving an alternative place to talk to my other siblings, or trying to see them, but it sometimes forces them to talk about my mom and dad when they don't necessarily want to be involved. The approach feels disrespectful, sneaky, and wrong. What angers me the most is that I have spoken to my other four siblings and they have fully expressed to me that either don't want to be involved or feel pressured to, or get pulled into it, or are angry by it. And then other times I am told by my oldest and eldest sibling that they are the ones that initiate and they will keep them out of it if they want to.

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent event happened today, and it has only proven how diluted and petty the issue has become. For reasons I don't know, my mom saw a text to my youngest sibling who is 12. My older and eldest sibling, as well as their significant others, were sending my brothers pictures of the lower half of the female anatomy, and were speaking to them about the parts of the vagina. (I do not know the original context, nor was I included in this conversation even though I am the their second eldest sister.) My mom calls me in tears after having being ripped apart by my older sister and the eldest of my brothers. According to my mom, all she did was tell them that when it comes to female parts and sex, she would prefer my youngest brother to not be included in the texts because she would rather him talk to her about it, and for her to explain the intricacies of that topic. I do not know completely the full text conversation (they do not speak) I just know that they told her that my sister has a master's degree in this type of communication, that they blame and question her for not having taught them these kind of intricacies, and that they are taking it upon themselves to explain it to my brothers, and that they refuse to stop doing so.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand where my mother is coming from. At this point, they want her to either apologize for everything, or not have any say in how my siblings are raised. And this breaks my heart because I do not think that is right. My mother stays true to herself and true her heart, and this has made her question everything and every decision she has made, to the point where she wonders that if her and my dad were to die in the near future, if they would be devastated by the loss. She doesn't want to celebrate mother's day, birthdays. This has hurt her beyond words.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother has begged me not to mention anything I've been told in fear of causing a rift between them and I. I can't speak to my mother fully in fear of accidentally hurting her further. I can't speak to my younger siblings about because I don't want to involve them, yet I also feel betrayed I was not included in discussions between my siblings. My mom constantly apologizes to me about everything she says that could be even slightly interpreted as negative in connotation. She always wants me to apologize to my boyfriend because she knows he's the only one I can discuss it with and it sometimes causes arguments between him and I, and she can't bear the idea of him not speaking to her too.

&amp;#x200B;

I do not know what to do. It is getting to a point where I can't be true to myself and my emotions towards my family. Is my thought process biased or wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am the second eldest in a family of 9. I have 5 younger brothers, ranging from ages 12-24, and one older sister.

&lt;p&gt;I will admit I am a very positive person, now and when I was a kid, and even if I was bothered by events growing up, they did not impact me enough to affect my life in a negative way and have any reason for me to speak at this intervention. I did agree to listening in on the meeting because I wanted to make sure I was at least aware of everything that was said. I am the only one out of my siblings that lives out of state, and unfortunately I have to make more of an effort to keep in contact with my siblings. Information is usually heard one sided or not at all and I am left out of things, so for this supposed important family meeting I wanted to hear things directly, and attempt to be a mediator/retain a neutral stance on everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It did not go as it should have gone. At all. Not in any constructive way that an intervention I thought was supposed to be. Instead of my siblings speaking to BOTH of my parents about how their issues within their relationship has affected them, it instead turned it into a meeting about how my mom failed raising my siblings growing up and how she is now failing my younger brothers. My eldest sister is better with words and she communicated effectively how she was feeling. The eldest of my brothers states how he is feeling in a very brutal and non-constructive manner, on the constant attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My eldest sister is a passionate woman who I have always looked up to as a leader, and still do. Growing up she struggled with overeating and being overweight. The eldest of my brothers, who was my video game companion and the brother I butted heads with the most, was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis at a young age, and depression when he was older. As far as I was and am concerned, my mom did the very best she possibly could to raise us all and did so lovingly in equal capacity to us all. This meeting did not shatter my belief in that, but shattered my family, especially my mother. My mom is a very passionate woman as well and if I had to pick two of my siblings that she could be compared to the most, it was my sister, and the eldest of my brothers. Unfortunately this does not bode well when being confronted. My mom could not take the information my siblings were hitting her with and I could not believe the information that was being said by my siblings. Eventually my brother-in-law took me into another room with my other brothers, and him and I talked about everything going on and being spoken about as the shouting and crying got louder in the other room. I did not get to hear the rest of the meeting and frankly I couldn&amp;#39;t handle it emotionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would not be the end of it, and it still has not ended. Every time I spoke to my mom in the months following the meeting, I could not (and hardly cannot) get through a conversation without her crying her heart out. This still haunts and hurts me to this day. I also set up separate times to speak to my siblings individually to hear their say. I am very partial to my mother, and as much as I didn&amp;#39;t agree with what my siblings were saying about her, I didn&amp;#39;t want to disregard their feelings and experiences because frankly, I am not them. I have an easier time talking with my sister, and while I did not agree with all of her reasons, I made a strong effort to understand them without it impacting my thoughts towards my mom. She believes that my mom always treats her as a child, not a woman. She believes that my mom undermines her opinions because she is viewed as my mother&amp;#39;s child, and not as a women with a masters degree in psychology and children&amp;#39;s studies, and therefore not taken seriously. She believes that my mom disregards her opinions because she is not a parent, and makes her feel guilty for not yet having children. She also believes that growing up my mom was always aware of her weight, making her feel guilty of it, and instilling dieting habits even though she was a child. My brother I have a harder time speaking to. Since he is always on the attack and harsh with his words, anytime in the past I have spoken my opinions, they are usually shot down and disregarded and I am left feeling empty and at a loss for words. He believes my mom is the cause behind why his health conditions got to the degree that he did. He believes that she disregarded the pain he had as a child. He believes that she put a label on his behavior, him being negative and unappreciative, and thus caused his siblings to view him as such, and not as a role model. He believes that she favored everyone but him and disregarded his wishes, especially when it came to gift-giving. He truly believes my mom is a terrible mother. At the time, I asked them both what it would take to have this end. They both said they want my mom to see a counselor for both herself and my father and for my mom to take full responsibility for everything they told me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was months ago. Since then, my family has only broken more. Any time my family makes a decision, ANY decision, if they find some aspect they disagree with, they blame my mom. (My FAMILY bought a puppy a few months back even though they couldn&amp;#39;t necessarily afford it, and they immediately threw hateful, disagreeable words at my mom, even though I was told my DAD wanted to get him.) And unfortunately it has caused my mom to feel betrayed if we have conversations with our siblings, in fear that we are talking bad about her, and has made her want to read everyone&amp;#39;s text messages including my fathers. Thankfully this fear has calmed down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom has attempted several times to speak to them and resolve the matter (and even going to start marriage counseling with my dad) though her approach does not settle well with them, and thus they retaliate. She is firm on her belief that she has raised them and done everything for them in the best way she could physically, emotionally, and mentally, she thinks she should not be blamed for these accusations and thinks that it is disrespectful for her children to treat her in this manner. My siblings are now constantly on the attack and are resolute in what they said and will not see my mom&amp;#39;s reasoning and attempts at resolving the issue. Over time, my mom has softened and has simply just tried to get together with them. No matter how she words her sentences, or how she carefully words what she says, they find something they dislike about it, shut her down, and disregard that my mom even tried. They are not willing to forgive, and are unwilling to compromise. My mom as well. They now hardly talk and see each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in more recent months, something even more distasteful has formed. My eldest and elder sibling use my younger siblings to stay connected with the family and completely have removed my parents from the equation. I understand they do not want to ostracize themselves from my other siblings and I think on a deeper level, they do not want to be ostracized from my parents. They convince my siblings to come over without telling my parents to give them a safe space to vent and talk about how things are going at home. They text them asking if my parents are home, and if they are not, go over to my family home and spend time with my siblings. They ask my siblings about their band competition and show up and sit with my parents, but hardly talk to them or keep very light conversation. I get a bad taste in my mouth. I appreciate my siblings giving an alternative place to talk to my other siblings, or trying to see them, but it sometimes forces them to talk about my mom and dad when they don&amp;#39;t necessarily want to be involved. The approach feels disrespectful, sneaky, and wrong. What angers me the most is that I have spoken to my other four siblings and they have fully expressed to me that either don&amp;#39;t want to be involved or feel pressured to, or get pulled into it, or are angry by it. And then other times I am told by my oldest and eldest sibling that they are the ones that initiate and they will keep them out of it if they want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent event happened today, and it has only proven how diluted and petty the issue has become. For reasons I don&amp;#39;t know, my mom saw a text to my youngest sibling who is 12. My older and eldest sibling, as well as their significant others, were sending my brothers pictures of the lower half of the female anatomy, and were speaking to them about the parts of the vagina. (I do not know the original context, nor was I included in this conversation even though I am the their second eldest sister.) My mom calls me in tears after having being ripped apart by my older sister and the eldest of my brothers. According to my mom, all she did was tell them that when it comes to female parts and sex, she would prefer my youngest brother to not be included in the texts because she would rather him talk to her about it, and for her to explain the intricacies of that topic. I do not know completely the full text conversation (they do not speak) I just know that they told her that my sister has a master&amp;#39;s degree in this type of communication, that they blame and question her for not having taught them these kind of intricacies, and that they are taking it upon themselves to explain it to my brothers, and that they refuse to stop doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand where my mother is coming from. At this point, they want her to either apologize for everything, or not have any say in how my siblings are raised. And this breaks my heart because I do not think that is right. My mother stays true to herself and true her heart, and this has made her question everything and every decision she has made, to the point where she wonders that if her and my dad were to die in the near future, if they would be devastated by the loss. She doesn&amp;#39;t want to celebrate mother&amp;#39;s day, birthdays. This has hurt her beyond words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother has begged me not to mention anything I&amp;#39;ve been told in fear of causing a rift between them and I. I can&amp;#39;t speak to my mother fully in fear of accidentally hurting her further. I can&amp;#39;t speak to my younger siblings about because I don&amp;#39;t want to involve them, yet I also feel betrayed I was not included in discussions between my siblings. My mom constantly apologizes to me about everything she says that could be even slightly interpreted as negative in connotation. She always wants me to apologize to my boyfriend because she knows he&amp;#39;s the only one I can discuss it with and it sometimes causes arguments between him and I, and she can&amp;#39;t bear the idea of him not speaking to her too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not know what to do. It is getting to a point where I can&amp;#39;t be true to myself and my emotions towards my family. Is my thought process biased or wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should I do?&lt;/p&gt;

I grew up with my grandparents. They made me who I am today. There's a twist to the story. The man who I thought of as my ""grandfather"", actually isn't. This man was some kind of genius who was tormented by his psychotic and possessive mother. His parents were loaded. I'm not sure if they were loaded, but they didn't have any money problems. The bottom line is, I'm not biologically related to this man. I found out with concrete, undeniable proof in 2018. The entire relationship my mother and grandmother have is dominated by this reality. They think I don't know. I can never confront them with this. It'd kill them both on the spot.

&amp;#x200B;

My family's story starts here. Everything they've ever done is breaking my back as of today. Oh, I'm from India, btw. So certain things might appear different to a reader from somewhere else on the planet. Think ridiculously complicated family trees, dowry, and societal pressure.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom and my father were forced into marriage. Well, I'm not sure about my dad. But my mom didn't even know what was happening, and what it meant (when she did get married). She was below legal age btw. It doesn't end here. My father was sexually abused/raped as a child. Or as a young man. I'm not sure which. I think he has blotted it out of his memory. Multiple times I've tried to analyze him with various questions. I've even asked him straight up. There's no doubt in my mind that his emerging sexuality was affected by this abuser. I even know the individual's name, and where they lived.   

&amp;#x200B;

My dad never really loved my mother. I think he did it for the money. That changed over time, of course. He likes me and my brother. It's genuine, I can tell. I don't think he likes my mother. His family sent him out of the house when he was really young. He lived with his sister. Who was also abusive. I feel bad for the man. I haven't always treated him with respect and dignity. Actually, I haven't treated anyone in my family as family. I'm just a guy who lives in their house. Do you realize how weird and psychologically damaging this is? They are in complete and utter denial of reality. They are oblivious to it. What's sickening is their moral masks that they put on to justify themselves. If they're not gonna open up to their own son, who they claim to love, who are they going to open up to on this planet? If they're not gonna open up to the guy who's literally saving their asses day in and day out, who are they gonna admit anything to? It's fucked up. And their sins are breaking my back, literally. I'm sick of it. I just wanna make a billion dollars so I can shove a few million in their faces, and run away to France. Really. I'm not even joking.

&amp;#x200B;

There's more. My father's sexuality, and my mother's lack of physicality in that department pretty much ensured that they have/had an unhappy marriage. They aren't really together anymore. What's the point in getting divorced after 3 decades, anyways. What added to their problems is the fact that my brother is my half-brother. I don't blame my mom. What will she do if my father is a victim, too? She's just a human. Just like my father is a human. I know who this guy is as well. The other father, that is. I know too much. Shit I wish that I didn't know.

&amp;#x200B;

There's even more. This whole thing is affecting my brother and me, in different ways. He's recovering from a bout with something. I think it was just a nervous breakdown. He did have some schizophrenic symptoms, but they've been absent for a very long time now. For more than half-a-decade. He's becoming self-sufficient. Slowly, but surely.  I've ridiculous levels of aggression, and energy because of this fucked up family situation. He's taking it in a negative way. He's letting it get to his head. That's the only difference between me and him. He's actually a lot more intelligent and well read than me. He's better looking too. That's the whole tragedy and why I get so angry at him sometimes. Really. He has no idea what he has on his plate. It's so annoying. I feel bad for saying it, but I'd rather die than waste such an intellect. I've even told him you're better off dead at times. I feel so bad. I try to jolt him into feeling something. For how many years can I be nice and pander him to like my mom does? Who does that? No one pandered to me for one second when I had a nervous breakdown all those years back. That's why I'm strong today. How can my mom not get this? This whole situation makes me so furious at times.

This has greatly affected our communication. I do not tell her anything because she will only use it against me. When I first started experiencing anxiety, she got mad at me and told me ""she didn't raise me to be this way"" and that I was a disappointment. 
3. She makes things about her. She used to wake us up in the middle of the night so we could console her after she hurt our feelings.

The neighborhood consisted of about 5 blocks of houses, a school that went from kindergarten-8th grade that all of the kids there attended, a small church next to the school, a small convenience store at the front of the neighborhood and it was on the very outskirts of the town I lived in surrounded by produce fields as if the whole town didn't really want the neighborhood to be part of it. My mom worked in another town at a jewelry store while finishing college, my dad worked in a mechanic shop with his dad/my grandpa while attending the police academy so when my older siblings and I got out of school and went home my grandma would watch us since she and my grandpa lived with us. My dad's desire to be a police officer made him drill 'stranger danger' into our heads so fiercely that by the time this story took place when I was 9 I thought any adult that talked to me who I didn't know was basically a monster in disguise. Now onto the main story.

One day when I was 9 years old I was waiting outside of school for a friend of mine to walk home with. Normally I'd walk home with my older sister who was 10 at the time, but she didn't want to walk home with ""two little brats"" so she went home ahead of me. No big deal since our house was 2 streets away from the school. As I'm waiting out front for my friend a car pulls up in front of me and the passenger window rolls down. Inside I see a woman about my grandma's age (late 40's-early 50's). I don't remember word-for-word what she said, but I remember her saying she knew my grandma and would drive me home. I instantly took off running, screaming at the top of my lungs that someone was trying to kidnap me without a thought about my friend. I ran all the way home in tears which made both my sister and grandma immediately worried.

My grandma calmed me down enough for her to understand what I was saying and when I described the lady as looking like her my grandma got really pissed. She stormed her way over to the house phone, yelling at my sister to get off the computer (this was early 2000's when this wasn't unheard of). She then proceeded to call someone, muttering curses under her breathe the entire time she waited for the person to answer. They answered and my grandma started chewing the person-my aunt-out demanding to speak to someone I had never heard the name of before. I guess my aunt asked why she wanted to speak to them because my grandma went into a tirade about how this person had basically traumatized me and asking her why the hell is ""she"" (my grandma said this in a very venomous way) wanted. I don't know what was said after that as my sister then took me to our shared room to help me with my homework.

I found out later that day from my grandma that the lady I had met was her sister/my great-aunt. My siblings and I had never met her before because to say my grandma and her sister didn't have a good relationship would be a gross understatement. From the moment my grandma was born her older sister-who was 3 years older than her-hated her. My great-aunt was not only an openly hostile person, but she wasn't afraid of getting physical with those she didn't like regardless of who the other person was. While my grandma wasn't as willing to get physical she was never afraid of speaking her mind and if someone started something with her she wasn't afraid to swing back at them. Most of the interactions ended with their parents (my great-grandparents) having to quite literally pry them apart from each other. It was so bad that if they were in the same room as each they **had** to be as far away from each other as possible and with at least one other person in between them. Even that didn't stop them from getting into all out brawls with each other. The last time they had spoken to each other was when my great-aunt was 18 and moving out. They screamed at each other, saying that they hated one another, my great-aunt said if my grandma was ever in the hospital she would only come to laugh in her face and my grandma told my great-aunt that she would throw a big party when she died. That had been 30 years prior. They hadn't spoke since then. They both got married, made careers for themselves, had kids and lived their lives without ever interacting with each other.

Until my great-grandfather died before I was born, when my dad was 13. Even then they didn't talk to one another, didn't try to comfort each other or acknowledge the other's existence at the funeral. This also happened years later when my great-grandmother died when I was 4. They stayed as far from each other as possible. Neither my siblings nor myself were even introduced to my great-aunt. We had a lot of family there that we hadn't met before who my grandparents happily introduced us to, but not her. Not even my aunt-her daughter-introduced us to her. My mom never even knew about my grandma's sister. The entire reason she decided 5 years later to try to reach out to her sister? They had found a tumor that they thought could be cancer. This caused my great-aunt to stop and think about her life. And she decided that she didn't want the last thing she ever said to her baby sister to have been a fight over 3 decades old. She wanted to at least try and reconcile. Why did she approach me and not one of my siblings? Apparently she remembered me from 5 years prior at my great-grandma's funeral and like many others there immediately noticed how much I looked like my great-grandma. Short, curly hair with round pink cheeks, one dimple when I smile and blue eyes. She later learned from my aunt that I was named after her mother and I guess that just really struck something in her, so she decided that I was the one she wanted to help be the bridge.

A few days later we all went to my aunt's house and we got to meet my great-aunt. It was surprising to see my grandma fall into tears upon talking to her and for the first time in I think what was their entire lives she hugged my great-aunt. They told each other stories about their lives since my great-aunt had moved away. She'd gone to school and become a nurse (I don't remember where or what kind of nurse), she married a nice man, they had kids and a few years prior her husband had passed away due to complications from pneumonia if I remember correctly. Since then she had lived alone in her 2-story house with her 3 pets-a cat and 2 ankle biting chihuahuas. Some time after this the tests came back and it thankfully wasn't cancer. The tumor was benign and the surgery to remove it went off without a hitch. My grandma started to regularly spend time with her, going to lunch, getting pedicures and visiting her house. Sometimes with my siblings and I tagging along. From this I heard many stories about their childhood with my great-grandparents and they learned a lot about each other that surprised even them. For instance, they learned that even though they fought and often badmouthed each other to their own friends whenever someone else would insult their sister they'd jump to their defense. There's one specific time I remember my great-aunt talking about from when she was 13 and one of her male classmates said something inappropriate about my grandma-who was 10 at the time-and without a second thought my great-aunt spun around and got in his face saying that she would (and I quote) ""shove \[his\] dick down \[his\] throat"" if he ever said anything like that about her sister again. She ended up getting into a fight with this guy and was ultimately suspended from school for it, but this was nothing new as like I said earlier she was the type who wasn't afraid to get physical with people she didn't like. So when it happened my grandma just thought she had gotten into a fight over something stupid as she was an aggressive person. There were many other instances where both my grandma and my great-aunt would defend the other when they weren't around each other, but that's the one I remember the most. Mostly because at the time I had no idea what a dick was and had immediately asked what that was which made my great-aunt burst out laughing while my grandma simply told me to never say that word again while trying to keep herself from laughing. It showed that despite how much they hated each other at the same time they also loved each other. For the next few years before she passed any time someone made fun of me for thinking she was trying to kidnap me she would laugh and say that that was the first time she had ever been really scared in her life. She-who had gotten into fights with guys way bigger and stronger than her-was terrified by a 9 year old.

My great-aunt passed away a few years later when I was 16. My grandma was sad, but at the same time she was thankful that she got the time she did with her sister. She always says whenever anyone brings up her sister that those were the best years she ever had with her. She believes that the time apart allowed them both to mature, and that if it hadn't had been for that health scare they probably never would've spoken to each other again. They were both very stubborn and because of their vitriolic past together neither one of them would've made that first step at reconnecting otherwise. For the first time since my grandma could remember she was able to not just be in the same room as her sister, but sit next to her sister. She could talk, smile and laugh with her. She finally had a good, healthy relationship with her big sister. I'm 23 now and whenever we talk about my great-aunt my sister or grandma will bring up how I was absolutely certain I was going to be kidnapped which everyone loves to make fun of me for. But always after the laughter dies down my grandma will say that she's so thankful for everything that happened from that day because she can't imagine not having those memories with her sister she now does and that she never would've forgiven herself if her sister had died and that fight over 30 years ago had been the last time they ever talked.

**TL;DR:** I thought a lady was trying to kidnap me when I was 9 and it turned out she was my great-aunt who my grandma had a bad relationship with and she wanted to reconcile with my grandma/her little sister which she did and they had a good relationship up until her death when I was 16.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some background info: I grew up in the ghetto.

Fair warning, this is a story with no happy ending, it's more a way to vent about the last few years of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm 30 years old, college professor, newly wed and I have a newborn daughter, and fatherhood has made me reflect on the absolute power parents have over their children's life. I apologise over grammar since this is not my native language.

&amp;#x200B;

My father was born in a 7 children family, he was the third one and they lived in a very small house, and ever since they where children, my father was put in charge of the welfare of his younger siblings.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, ever since I can rememeber, my father had a deep rooted and strong depression, wich in turn, led him to an alcohol adiction that ultimatly killed him. The following is a recount of the many many ways his mother and his family, not counting his father neglected him.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my father was married to my mother in the 70's, and in this era having a fridge was a big luxury, and when the newly wed couple bought one, my grandmother got super pissed because ""he should have bought one for her before"". He said no, his wife and newborn (my brother) came first. They didn't spoke for a few months after that. 

&amp;#x200B;

My father let my grandparents stay with him for a few weeks while repairs where being made in their house, after this,  she demanded that my father let her take his new couch and heater since ""she got used to them"". He said no.

&amp;#x200B;

When one if my fathers siblings got a job interview, they sent my father to take the test with his sibling so he can help her cheat in the test (they got separated to take the test in diferent rooms, so he was saved), she was still pissed my father got the job and my aunt didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

My father was the odd one in his family, since he was honest and worked hard and got to live a comfortable life thanks to this, this didn't stoped his siblings and they tried to take every penny they could from my father: They invented being sick in order to ask money for treatments and then we would find out they went on a trip, my father got them jobs and they would get fired for stealing or not showing up, he even kept them out of jail a couple of times. He even got one of his siblings a house to rent for a very cheap price from another member of the family, and he destroyed the house, took the floor boards out of the bathroom.

&amp;#x200B;

We are many cousins, and two of them where from a very very poor home, my uncle (a single parent) would make bread every day because it would be cheaper than buying bread, by this time my grandparents where very well off, and whenever my cousins would visit, my grandmother would hide food from them, she would hide the cookie jar, turn off the oven if she was baking, stop cooking on the stove, etc. Because she didn't like the fact that my cousins (who where 4 and 7 years old) where so hungry that they would devour any food in front of them and she didn't like they sight of this, luckly my uncle got a better job soon after that and things picked up for them.

&amp;#x200B;

By the later part of his life, when I was born, my father was a shell of a human being, he never felt loved by his mother, adicted to alcohol we tried everything to get him treatment. Everything from psicologists, psychiatrists, a surgically inserted pellet. Now, i know that my father made his choices,that his adiction was his own, but it all came crashing down when my niece, his grandaughter passed away from an accident at 3 years old, this is the instance that caused my dad to give up on life, 3 years later he died from neumonia in his sleep, and he work for that, he stoped caring after this. The cherry on the cake came when we found out that my own grandmother was spreding the rumor that we where feeding my dad alcohol. 

&amp;#x200B;

She also stole his wedding ring and pawned it, we bought it back a few months after he died when we found out. She died the year after my dad, and I remember that when I was talking a cousin named Claudia that my grandma raised (name changed), she said something along the lins of ""well, the world is a better place now"". Most of the people at the funeral where there for my grandfather, and he was a noble man, he worked hard his whole life, but he was surrounded by bad people.

&amp;#x200B;

And even with his adiction he managed to raise three children, loving people with good morals, my brother and sister are the most hard working people I know. 

&amp;#x200B;

We absolutly don't talk to my fathers side of the family anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I look at my daughter, she is a month old and I just can't understand how or why there are people in this world not willing to give everything for their children, My family and I, my brothers, my mother and my mother's side of the family, we are happy, we are close, and of course I miss my dad, I go see him at the cementery every two weeks when I visit my grandma, but I know he taught us well, he made sure that when the time came, I would knew what it means to be a father, a husband, even when nobody taught him.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, for everyone reading this, remember that as a parent, we have absolute control over the way our children will see the world, that for every sad and messed up memory, a lesson can be learned. My father was never truly loved by his mother and it destroyed him, but he made sure that his children never felt this way.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Everyone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are many cousins, and two of them where from a very very poor home, my uncle (a single parent) would make bread every day because it would be cheaper than buying bread, by this time my grandparents where very well off, and whenever my cousins would visit, my grandmother would hide food from them, she would hide the cookie jar, turn off the oven if she was baking, stop cooking on the stove, etc. Because she didn&amp;#39;t like the fact that my cousins (who where 4 and 7 years old) where so hungry that they would devour any food in front of them and she didn&amp;#39;t like they sight of this, luckly my uncle got a better job soon after that and things picked up for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the later part of his life, when I was born, my father was a shell of a human being, he never felt loved by his mother, adicted to alcohol we tried everything to get him treatment. Everything from psicologists, psychiatrists, a surgically inserted pellet. Now, i know that my father made his choices,that his adiction was his own, but it all came crashing down when my niece, his grandaughter passed away from an accident at 3 years old, this is the instance that caused my dad to give up on life, 3 years later he died from neumonia in his sleep, and he work for that, he stoped caring after this. The cherry on the cake came when we found out that my own grandmother was spreding the rumor that we where feeding my dad alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also stole his wedding ring and pawned it, we bought it back a few months after he died when we found out. She died the year after my dad, and I remember that when I was talking a cousin named Claudia that my grandma raised (name changed), she said something along the lins of &amp;quot;well, the world is a better place now&amp;quot;. Most of the people at the funeral where there for my grandfather, and he was a noble man, he worked hard his whole life, but he was surrounded by bad people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even with his adiction he managed to raise three children, loving people with good morals, my brother and sister are the most hard working people I know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We absolutly don&amp;#39;t talk to my fathers side of the family anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I look at my daughter, she is a month old and I just can&amp;#39;t understand how or why there are people in this world not willing to give everything for their children, My family and I, my brothers, my mother and my mother&amp;#39;s side of the family, we are happy, we are close, and of course I miss my dad, I go see him at the cementery every two weeks when I visit my grandma, but I know he taught us well, he made sure that when the time came, I would knew what it means to be a father, a husband, even when nobody taught him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, for everyone reading this, remember that as a parent, we have absolute control over the way our children will see the world, that for every sad and messed up memory, a lesson can be learned. My father was never truly loved by his mother and it destroyed him, but he made sure that his children never felt this way.&lt;/p&gt;

In order to enter, you have to take a one year course called CBC, in which you sit through some of the most basic subjects of your career. Some years ago, the government applied what is called UBA XXI, in which people can sit through exams of this course without the need of assisting to class, aimed especially at seniors in high school. If  you pass a subject, you no longer need to assist it in this year-long-course, reducing your time taking it. As such, I decided to take 2 exams throughout last year.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom, father, grandfather and aunt all went to the same private university, and insisted on me going there too. However, I always knew I wanted to go to the University of Buenos Aires, for it is highly praised and popular. My mother decided to pressure me, claiming if I didn't pass my exams I would have to go to the one she went to, and claiming I should also pass all my high school subjects with high marks (the school I went to was very demanding and I had difficulty with physics and chemistry). Nothing wrong up until here, because I thought she didn't mean it, or that she was overreacting (I play a lot of videogames, she would always say I should be studying and therefore she didn't think I would make it). 

&amp;#x200B;

A bit more of context, here is how the UBA works (most of the times): you have 2 types of tests, partials and finals. The topic is divided so you have to sit through 2 partials (half of the subject in each) and a final one, in which you sit through it all. If your average score between both partials is above 7, you don't need to sit through the final. (You can pass with a 4). Both my exams I ended with an average of 8 so I didn't need to sit through any finals, and school went great with a 8+ average by the end of the year. 

&amp;#x200B;

While my father and his father were happy for me, (I was THRILLED), yesterday I found out my mother and all her sisters were cheering for me to fail, and some of her sisters actually told my mom to just sign me in the University she went to behind my back. Surprisingly enough, I am not mad at her, or her sisters for doing so. Instead, I am happy I proved them wrong and this just motivates me to keep studying where I chose. It will be hard (that's why it's a good uni) but now i know that I will keep showing them what I'm capable of.

## Wishing death

Let me be honest I wished you died so many times, I wished death to myself

as well, I was feeling guilty for being born, you were too busy while

working on your soap opera Mom, and I was only 10 years old ready to

attempt suicide, but you’ve never seen it.

You were cursing me because I was the only one of your children who got a

father and guess what I was so lucky that I got invited to his funeral and

now you wanna die too.

Hatred is such a noble sentiment, is the purest expression of love, you

wouldn’t even deserve it for the way you treated me during your life, but

your poor soul can’t see what I am saying, you just think I am crazy, saying

you have always loved me.

I wonder how it would be if you hated me and I’m glad I ain’t gonna see it

because being loved by you was more painful than giving birth through my

ass.

&lt;p&gt;your poor soul can’t see what I am saying, you just think I am crazy, saying&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you have always loved me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder how it would be if you hated me and I’m glad I ain’t gonna see it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;because being loved by you was more painful than giving birth through my&lt;/p&gt;

So, my grandmother (Let's call her Dolly since she had doll-looking eyelashes) died around last year or so. She was the sweetest old lady, spoiling me and my older sister (let's just call her princess for the sake of her personality). My uncle (let's cal him.. Mikey) is disabled, having been paralyzed on his left side after a stroke. Dolly took care of him, but also had helpers do so, too, since she was old and couldn't do it all by herself (she was in her late 80s to early 90s). After her death, one of her helpers (Lets call herrr... Casey) became Mikey's girlfriend.  
Now, me, my mom (Jenny), and Princess did *not* approve of her. Especially myself, since Dolly repeatedly said Casey *stole from her*, and me, being me, utterly believed her. She was my grandmother for heaven's sake. She had no reason to lie to me!  
Now, Casey had two shitlord sons (lets call them Clyde and Tyke), along with several little dogs, I can't remember the breed for the life of me.  
Mother never made me go see any of them, luckily.  
After several months of being together, Mikey and Casey break up. Jenny goes to visit Mikey because the chaos she-demon known as Casey and her demonspawn are gone now. Finally! But.. Here's the kicker. The absolute kicker.  


*The demonspawn named Clyde and Tyke stole from my grandmother's room. They* ***stole*** *from a dead woman's family who* ***dearly*** *loved her. They pawned off a whole lot of stuff, like her expensive jewelry and many rings (Some of which belonged to my mother, or even my dearly departed Grandfather who, since I don't mind naming here, was named Buddy).* We've never attempted to sue since we can't find her anymore, thank the heavens. If I ever see them, I'll probably kick their butts to hell and back for doing that.

They wanted us to believe that only girls could have long hair, ear piercings, and skinny jeans, and if a guy had any of the above, then he was clearly gay. They also wanted us to have disdain towards things like tattoos and piercings that go anywhere except the ears, saying that those are ugly and trashy.

Being that I was the only boy in my family, this was a lot harder for me. I’d see other boys with longer hair, sometimes with skinny jeans, and I’d want to have those too because I liked the look, but then my mom would tell me I must want to look like a girl if that was the case. I didn’t have a say so when it came to things like clothes and haircuts. I was forced to get buzzcuts and I was forced to wear baggy jeans. 

It wasn’t until I was 11 that my mom allowed me to have long hair and slim jeans, with me being able to wear actual skinny jeans at 12. At 15, I stopped caring for long hair and would get taper fades, but I still wore skinny jeans. At this time, I wanted a left ear piercing. My mom was extremely against it, as she began to tell me that only a girl would have that. Eventually, I did manage to convince her, and for a while, I was happy with how I looked.

At 18, I was allowed to have both ears pierced, but then, when I wanted my nose pierced, she got very angry at me, and began to hit me with homophobic slurs, saying I must want to be a fag (I’m straight, but that doesn’t mean I can’t get a nose piercing, right?). She eventually let me get one after my 19th birthday just three months ago, but now I’ve been wanting a tattoo, but I’m extremely reluctant to get one. 

I’m constantly insulted over my hair because I have really long bangs, and I see the expression on my mom’s face, looking almost disgusted, every time she looks at me and my hair and piercings. I’d also feel like I fit in when I’m with my friends, or when I’m on campus, but I feel like a complete outsider at home. I feel like I’m everything they never wanted me to be, and it really affects my self conscious sometimes.

TL;DR I ended up getting everything my mom always told me not to get, and I feel like I’m disappointing her and the rest of my family even further with every thing I do.

But despite that she is an amazing young woman and I’m so proud of her.

My oldest daughter is turning 18 tomorrow and I’m proud as fuck of her. She finds too much affection uncomfortable so I’ve kept things toned down for her but I need to tell people just how amazing she is. I took my 2 girls and left their father when they were 3 and 1.5 years old, the day after he shoved me against a wall and put his hands on my throat. The abuse had been going on for years, mostly verbal and sexual ( sexual to me only, not the girls) that eventually turned physical. That started 9 years of going in and out of family court, narcissistic abuse from their father and eventual step mother, threats from him to make the police take them from me so they’d never see him again and one incident of near kidnapping. I’d have to counsel the girls when they come from visiting him and counsel them before they went back. Eventually the girls refused to see him any more and we went to court for the last time - and he agreed to me having 100% custody. But when she went to high school there was a teacher that looked, acted and sounded like her father and she had a breakdown. She was so scared and emotional, she blamed herself for everything, for not being good enough, smart enough or thin and pretty enough. She started cutting herself and was actively suicidal. I was so scared for her and I just wanted to go into her brain and erase all the horrible, derogatory things that her father said to her so that she could be a normal, happy teenager. But I couldn’t so I took her to a psychologist. For 5 years. She has PTSD, general anxiety, health anxiety and depression. We worked really hard together to challenge her automatic thoughts that told her things were going to go wrong and it will be her fault and she needed to be punished (her father, being a narcissist, was never happy or satisfied with anything the girls did and would punish them for not meeting his ridiculously high expectations. When he was no longer there to punish her, she punished herself by cutting). She was close to overdosing on paracetamol 4 times that I know of, popped out the pills, held them in her hand but threw them away instead. She stopped cutting a couple of years ago. She learned how to self regulate her emotions. She learned how to reflect on actions and thoughts to chose an alternative behaviour next time. She is incredibly tolerant and accepting of others and an advocate for animals and the LGBT community. 2 weeks ago she sat for her driving learners test - an extremely anxiety provoking situation - and passed with 100%. She donates her pocket money to worthy causes such as vet bills or families in hardship (we had a house fire almost 3 years ago and she remembers how hard that was and how much the community and complete strangers helped us, so she wants to give back).

&lt;p&gt;We were supposed to go to a comic con this weekend, but I had to tell her no. I had to get some maintenance done to my car and I just can&amp;#39;t afford it. The con isn&amp;#39;t that much, but it&amp;#39;s a two hour drive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is upset with me and I feel disappointed in myself. I feel like a bad aunt. I&amp;#39;ve always done things with her and taken her places, etc, but that was when I lived close by. I also have to work every Saturday until the afternoon with my new job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want her, or my nephew, to think I don&amp;#39;t love them or that I am avoiding spending time with them. I make time when I can. Between work and planning a wedding, my life is super hectic right now. I try to explain this to her, but she is a teenager and you know how that goes. &lt;/p&gt;

Long story short, we were planning to move near husbands family ASAP b/c our kids are close in age with their cousins and we want them to grow up together but suddenly this year husbands siblings are separating from their spouses and now their focus is no longer on their kids but their new partners. My texts are going unanswered about school breaks b/c they bounce the kid between the 2 sets of grandparents etc, and they will just text me about all these new things they are doing, no mention of their kids?? My kids love their cousins but I feel like everyone is moving on from the joys of spending time as a family. They let the ipad's babysit the kids now. 4 of their cousins sit on their ipads/phones all day. I feel like I'm the bad one making my kids ""play"". I try to ignore it during vacations but now its all starting to get to me. How does a family work??

Advice? Help?

*We have basically two options:*

1. Move near husbands family where we wouldn't be able to afford a nicer home for awhile but the weather is perfect and close in drive to many cities. But I would struggle with discipline but maybe I can make it work with keeping schedules. I would always be the mean one though ;p And I can't guarantee my kids will even see their cousins anymore as their parents make their new lives.
2. Move to another state husband can transfer to but with no family around, high humidity (time spent mostly indoors) and depend on school breaks for visiting family. Who knows, I might feel lonely w/ a nice house and time spent mainly on my kids. or is that the best option?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;td;lr How important is it to live near family or be close to family members?

Yea. TL:DR at the end. Sorry for any grammar error. 

A little bit of background. My dad and my brother are very explosive when they get angry, but my brother has the habit of slamming doors and throwing tantrums when he gets mad. Also he gets mad very easily. He gets angry when he's hungry, he gets angry when he's sleepy, he gets angry when he's sick, you get the idea. 
Also, my brother and my sister get a little bit of money every 2 weeks for school, lunch, and busses. 

So this follows 3 incidents with my brother's tantrums.

The first incident happened a month ago or so. My little sister was bothering him and he got angry, slamming open our front bars door and in doing so cracking the wall. A piece of wall fell of and my parents got mad at him, but not punishment fell in him that day.

The second one was a week ago. I was in the common room with my mom and we were watching ""A star is born"". Now, I tend to comment a lot about movies at home. I talk about the plot, the music the actors and so on. And my voice is kinda loud. That day my brother was sick in his bedroom. Aaand, that movie took me into an emotional roller-coaster so I was laughing, crying and kinda screaming with my mom. My brother got mad and asked for me to turn down my voice, fair enough, I lower the volume and say if we're bothering him, he could close the door. We continue watching the movie, and then he just slammed the door. My mom went and scolded him about it, saying how he doesn't get mad when his friends are staying for the night and making a lot of noise even when my dad and I are trying to sleep because we have work. Again, nothing meaningful happens to him.

But lastly, that weekend karma came for his soul.

That Sunday, my mom, my granny, my sister and I went to get some groceries, my dad went to road with his friends and my brother stayed home. My mom called him after we went to ask him to wash the dishes and broom a little. He tried to protest but said yes. 30 minutes later he calls my mom and the conversation went as follows :

Bro : Hey... Mom... Can.. Can you buy a new doorknob please?
Mom: a new doorknob? Why?
Bro: The... Kitchen doorknob... Broke.

Turns out, Bro didn't liked being asked to clean, so in his way out to get the broom he shut open the kitchen door, slamming the doorknob on the wall and leaving it useless. My mom had enough. She handed him that Monday his money for the 2 weeks (maybe 17 dollars) and said to him he had to buy a new doorknob himself, with his money.
Now, my mom packs my sibling some lunch so they can eat at recess, but the money is for any craving or a movie. Needless to say he lost almost all of his money for the two weeks and only had left money for the bus home.

TL:DR: Bro likes to trow tantrums, breaks our kitchen doorknob and losses almost all his money for 2 weeks.

How are we this fine evening?

In January, I moved home to help my mother out. She's getting on a bit, really suffers with her bones and has a couple of hernias in her stomach. She claims PIP and ESA and was supporting my brother on this money before I made arrangements to move back in so I can help her with the bills and housework.

Reddit, I need your advice on what to do about my brother. 

He is 20 and honestly a massive waste of human existence. He sits in his room with his chav friends all day every day playing on his Xbox, smoking mum's tobacco and eating food he so thoughtfully cooked for himself and his friends without asking us first. This pattern of behaviour only changes on weekends. From Friday until Monday, he disappears with his aforementioned friends. When he comes back, he's usually high on weed, coke, speed, MDMA and God only knows what else. This is just the stuff I know he takes. I also have reason to suspect he was stealing mum's pills as well before I came back because I caught him in the act of stealing some of my medication. I've since hidden all of mine and mum's prescription meds, along with our money and bank cards because I just can't trust him not to steal from us. 

He refuses to get a job, doesn't claim JSA and won't even attempt to get PIP for his supposed mental illness (tbh I think the only mental illness he has is self-inflicted with drug use). 

When I last visited before moving down here, he bullied and emotionally manipulated mum into buying him a new iPhone because he threw the old one in temper and smashed it. She bought him one despite me telling her to put her foot down. He doesn't even clean his own piss off the toilet seat and refuses to help around the house.

Reddit, I'm at my wits end with him. Mum doesn't want to kick him out because it'll make him homeless, and I don't want to drive a wedge between me and her by doing it myself. But I don't know how much longer I can handle his appalling behaviour and laziness. What the hell can I do about him?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone!

""Last year my father passed away suddenly. I saw him on the operation table and it obvious many different types of procedures were recently attempted to try to save him when I arrived with my mom to see him. My brother later came with his fiance and saw him before my dad was cleaned up and put in another room. What followed that day and later that month totally took me by surprise. My grandmother told my brother the day of my dads death that my dad left ""nothing"" for her and my uncle called for official death certificates while we were still in the hospital. My mom brother, his fiance and I all expressed outrage that people could be so mean and cruel. Then out of then blue probably a week or so after the funeral my brothers fiance told my mom that an attorney told her(sil) that the kids(which includes my brother who she eventually married, my other brother and me)get half of the estate. I couldn't believe she would tell my mom that, like she was putting my mom on notice that my mom better not claim my dads portion of the estate and threatening to put my mom through legal trouble and stress (due to increased legal fees my mom would have to pay) in order to make sure her husband(my brother) would get his inheritance that she feels she would benefit from. The fact that she did this after I sought her comfort and held her while I cried my dads ashes being stored in the niche and during the wedding when my dad was being remembered makes me so angry and I feel betrayed by her. 

She has done other things following my dads death that irk me like not letting and or offering for my mom to be with my brother for a ceremony, and a total personality change after the marriage was legally finalized. However her comments to my mom about the distribution of my dads estate are particularly evil in my opinion. There is an understanding that my relatives on my dads side are not welcome to be anywhere near my dads estate due to their appalling behavior. I can argue that my brothers now wife has shown similar if not worse behavior. Therefore, I am considering banning her and her family as well as I am a trustee of the estate.""

Since this post was made,I have attended sessions with a marriage and family therapist with my brother and mom present. The therapist explained initially that there are separate "" family systems"" (nuclear family, in laws etc) and that when someone gets married there is tension due to the change in the family dynamic. Commonly mom or dad can get tempted to get involved in private issues of son or daughter's marriage. He says family need to respect the boundaries of each individual family system. When I told him ""well what about the sil? She didn't respect the boundaries of my family system(nobody gave her permission to ask about inheritance). The therapist then was stuck but I knew he agreed with my rebuttal but doing so aloud would overwhelm my brother so he told me to talk with my brother one on one. I did just that and asked my brother, ""do you believe what your wife did by telling our mom that an attorney told her that the kids get half of the estate is appropriate?"" He said I dont agree with the premise of your argument(what ever that was supposed to mean) and tried to justify her actions by saying she is not like that.

I went to another session alone and the therapist(who saw my sil and my brother individually)said that my sil is extremely attached to her family of origin and is mainly concerned about doing things for their and my brothers benefit. When I asked him if it is reasonable to believe that she is concerned about the benefits my brother receive because she wants access to the family money and she is using her child to manipulate my mom for money and access to properties via free or reduced rents for her and her family of origin, he told me that based on his session with my sil and her past actions my suspicions are reasonable. He made it a point that my sil telling my mom that an attorney told her that the kids get half of the estate is inappropriate and there is no justification for it because she made a choice to say those things.
He did try to tell me to be the ""bigger person"" and to use his observations to try to better understand where she is coming from(he said he believes my sil didnt do what she did because she hates me in particular, she just doesn't care about how I feel because she is primarily concerned about her family of origin and getting benefits for them)because if I don't i risk damaging my relationship with my brother and having him side with my sister in law and her family. I told him I cant control if that happens and will have to accept that he made that choice if he makes it.

He then told me to have a discussion about where my brothers stand on the situation because he feels I deserve to know straight from them, particularly the married  brother, whether they think what my sister in law did was inappropriate, my thoughts about her intentions are understandable and justified, and whether I have the assurance that my sil and her family will not be allowed to touch any family money or set foot in any commercial building that is family owned (having this assurance from both of them is important because therapist agreed with me that having sil and her family involved in my family's money and estate not ideal). The therapist told me that should I not get the assurance from my married brother, I am justified to take steps to keep her and her family away from the estate as my intentions he feels are based on protecting my dads legacy and the family money not trying to gain money unfairly for myself. Even thought my mom agrees with my stance on the situation, she objects to me talking to my brothers about where they stand. She told me if I did that my married  brother would ask her for money and it would cause her stress. I feel she could just tell him no. However I feel she is trying to protect my married brother because she feels his marriage would collapse and he wouldnt be able to deal with the financial and emotional stress of a divorce. On top of that I think the true opinions from two people whose opinion he finds credible(mom and therapist) about the situation would cause my married brother to breakdown mentally(my opinion I believe is being rationalized as ""irrational due to grief"" or "" sibling jealousy over marriage"" by my mom and brother to kick the can down the road so to speak) 

Is my sil justified to get involved in in laws inheritance because the inheritance would significantly impact her, her husband and her child life and her husband is a beneficiary of the inheritance(due to way my dad did things, inheritance ended up with my mom with me and my married brother trustees)?

Is what my sil did inappropriate?

Is what my mom doing(trying to prevent me from talking to my brothers about the situation) understandable? Is it justified for my mom to take actions to try to preserve a marriage that is not her own?

and he doesn’t deserve.

His death would be such a joy for me, it would make my soul free from a

burden heavier than a herd of elephants stepping on my heart while

mating.

If I just could I would destroy his silly brain and eat his heart full of

putrefied worms.

I will love to create a bomb with his organs and let him blow as if he was a

go to prison for the rest of my life.

Oh shit you are talking about your brother!

Fuck yea, I am talking about him, would you imagine that your brother

could convince your mother to steal from you, taking advantages of your

distance, while you were trying to survive abroad?

And when you were back you didn’t find your bed?

They stole my things, shitty fucking ticks more deadly than death, I hate

you!

I fucking hate you.

You are fucking miserable so miserable not to deserve a sentiment as noble

as my hatred, you would deserve indifference.

After all, my brother is less valuable than a scrapped car.

I hope you disappear from the earth before humanity is extinguished.

You contributed to make this world a piece of shit.

If I think I am your sister I wanna step back in another vagina and born

again from a different mother.

I hope life will bring your life as you stole my soul through your violence,

vile, filthy creature, I hope you die, but guess what for me you are dead and

buried more than my dad, if I think about your breath I feel sick, if I ever

see your corpse on the street I will hit it in reverse.

&lt;p&gt;go to prison for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh shit you are talking about your brother!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck yea, I am talking about him, would you imagine that your brother&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;could convince your mother to steal from you, taking advantages of your&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;distance, while you were trying to survive abroad?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when you were back you didn’t find your bed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They stole my things, shitty fucking ticks more deadly than death, I hate&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fucking hate you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are fucking miserable so miserable not to deserve a sentiment as noble&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as my hatred, you would deserve indifference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, my brother is less valuable than a scrapped car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you disappear from the earth before humanity is extinguished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You contributed to make this world a piece of shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I think I am your sister I wanna step back in another vagina and born&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;again from a different mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope life will bring your life as you stole my soul through your violence,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;vile, filthy creature, I hope you die, but guess what for me you are dead and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;buried more than my dad, if I think about your breath I feel sick, if I ever&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;see your corpse on the street I will hit it in reverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodbye for now, fucking asshole!&lt;/p&gt;

Little back story, they’re both alcoholics like I’m talking they’ve been slamming vodka every night since I was 8 years old, I’m 23 now. So my dad used to be a bit on the abusive side, sometimes physical but mostly emotionally/mentally. My step mom is a Russian psycho when you push her buttons or when she’s drinking she is a loose cannon. While her daughter is currently recovering from heroin addiction over the past 2 years I’d say. 

So years have gone by since any of that. I’m an adult now and I’d never let anything happen and he’s seemingly changed a bit so I was ready and willing to build a better relationship. He is my father and I love and care for him dearly. 

So, December they had told us they were getting us plane tickets to come visit them (my boyfriend and I, my step-sister was not able to make it due to being in rehab) in Florida we had thought. Then a couple weeks later my dad calls me and tells us he’s taking us to Turks &amp; Caicos. An island they love and visit often. 

So the trip starts off beautifully. We’re all laughing and smiling and getting along. It was great I really saw potential in everything. 

Day 3, that night as per usual they’re drinking (they just take straight shots of vodka throughout the night whereas they used to make mixed drinks with vodka and cranberry)
So I’m complaining about my current job situation a little and my step mom starts to get defensive about my past mistakes with school and how they paid for one of my loans and basically starts throwing everything in my face saying I’m a fuck-up and they have me a great chance. I ended up running out of the house uncontrollably ugly sobbing (you know that cry where you literally can’t control it that it’s like all your emotions are just like OK NOW!)
I felt awful! Hurt and offended and embarrassed! Not only was she doing this on our “family vacation” but to top it off this was the first time they’re meeting my boyfriend. 

Day 4, I actually apologized to her firstly. Because towards the end of her lash out on me the night prior - I said something that i knew would hit her like a dagger, mostly only to shut her up because I was sick of hearing her insults. 
So I apologized first, was the bigger person, though I had no desire or care to be. In reality I really did it for my dad because I don’t really care about my relationship with my step-mom because in my honest opinion she’s a nasty cunt. 

Days go by, things are going well like nothing ever happened.

Day 6, My boyfriend and I had a rough start to the morning. We got into a little tiff so we wanted to kind of keep to ourselves. Mind you we have spent every waking moment with my parents, beach during the day, we’d pack lunch then come back for dinner and watch movies all night. So our last day before we board the plane the next day, we wanted to take it easy and relax. We both weren’t in good moods so we weren’t trying to bug anyone else with our issues. We sat on the beach in the shade I read a book while he laid down. I ended up taking a nap in our room because I couldn’t sleep the night prior. It was like a 2 hour nap at best. My boyfriend this whole time had been sitting in the common room with my dad and step-mom watching some movie. So I wake up and my step moms walking around so I asked if the washer and dryer are free so we can do our laundry before we go back home. She had the balls to say to me “not all of us have the luxury of sleeping all day so no more laundry will be done today” first of all, what the fuck does one have to do with the other? Second of all, so because you want to be a big fat cunt, you’re going to make us go all the way home with dirty clothes in our luggage. Okay. 

Then, just as we’re about to get to bed and close the door, my step mom asks me to come sit and talk and I could her how drunk she was already. So I come out and before I even get the chance to sit down. She’s jumping down my throat. At this point my boyfriend comes out to make sure everything is alright. She jumps down his throat. Calling us “ungrateful,disgusting”said his “first impression was shit” that the next time was “family only” and if I’m being honest the only reason I was comfortable even going on vacation with them was because my boyfriend would be right by my side in case anything shitty happened (which it did). So my step mom and i are going back and forth. She’s Insulting myself and my boyfriend over and over. Because of this last day, because we weren’t having a good day and we ruined it for them because they didn’t enjoy seeing us “mope” as my dad casually stands next to her calling us disgusting and not having my back whatsoever. 

I was absolutely appalled. 

Didn’t talk to my dad for weeks after that,had no desire to. Until I finally tried to tell him how all that made me feel. Then he tries to blame other things and say he just wants the best for me that I’m “settling” because I got my boyfriend his dinner plates and do things for him. Jesus Christ like they have no idea how our relationship works. And if they had any issues. My father should’ve pulled me aside and privately talked to me about it! Because at this point why would my boyfriend ever want to see their faces again, and I’m jumping in that boat with him after all of that. Unless they quit drinking or something then I don’t know. 

It’s just useless talking to my dad. He only disagrees with everything I say and they only see things the way that they want to see them. 

Super long rant/story. But let me know, what would you do in this situation?

I just don’t know how to feel anymore. 

And to add insult to injury, my blood brother hasn’t talked to my dad in over 7 years I’d say. That is a whole other story but like I’m at the point where I don’t want to cut him out of my life but like???? I can’t keep dealing with this.
