"Hello! You may have noticed more flairs around the sub lately. That's because we have listened to user feedback requesting ways to allow more open dialogue between OPs and commenters. To facilitate this, we have implemented a flair system that allows the OP to let our community know their situation and what level of feedback they are comfortable with. For our community, the OP can include a trigger warning with any of these. From now on, we will require all posts to have a flair. Any post that is not will either be taken down temporarily or have a flair assigned by a moderator. If your post is taken down, you will have to choose a flair and then contact the moderators via [ModMail](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/JUSTNOMIL) to have your post restored. To help you understand the flairs, I've included the descriptions of the flairs that you can find in the [JustNoMIL Wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/wiki/index)

The new language you will find in the Wiki is:

Posts that are left without flair are subject to being temporarily removed, or having flair chosen for them, at moderator discretion. There are also trigger warning versions of each flair. **Trigger Warning** flairs dictate that the trigger warning be briefly described in the **first** sentence of the post.

"This is a story from when I was growing a spine. It's an older one, but I'll share it here for anyone who is shining up their own spine. A motivational missive maybe? I hope you enjoy.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I had a baby. Like you do. It doesn't feel like it was terribly long ago but my kid is over ten so things have definitely changed since then. Back in those days, we didn't have fancy video baby monitors or breathing sensors or any of the amazing fancy things you new moms get these days. We had a simple baby monitor. The base was in the baby's room and the receiver was either in our bedroom or the living room, wherever we were. It was a pretty good monitor, you could definitely hear what was going on in the baby's room... and so our story begins.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents were visiting. I didn't know what a JustNo was at that time- I knew my biological father was abusive, hence the restraining orders. But my mom was so much better than him, I didn't ever think to question what she said... until I became a mother. Then all bets were off. I lost my first baby and NOBODY was going to do anything wrong when my son was born. His health and safety came first. Anyway, my JSometimesMom and VeryJustYesSaintofAStepfather were visiting.  My mother had some opinions about our parenting decisions (things had changed since the 70's?!?!? Who would have thought?) but kept them mostly to herself. Until my aunt called her. We were all in the living room and so she took her cell into the baby's room to sit in the rocker and chat. And trash my parenting.

&amp;#x200B;

And so we sat in the living room, my husband and I, (I don't remember where my JYSF was) and heard her make fun of me and my choice of... everything. And how I was overprotective and this and that. It lasted a good 20 minutes. Then she came back, completely oblivious to the fact that we'd heard the whole thing. A lifetime of rugsweeping training kicked in and I pretended nothing had happened. More time passed in the visit, she played with the baby, I fed him, my stepfather came back from probably Home Depot. And we were all in the living room when the baby had a blowout.

&amp;#x200B;

DH and I took the baby to his room to change the baby and get the blowout damage under control. And while we were in there, we were very aware that anything we said would be heard over the baby monitor in the living room. Both of my parents would hear anything we said. I can't remember the specifics of what we said, but I know it was in reference to some ""suggestions"" my mother had made that were out of date or wouldn't work for us. We weren't mean or rude- just matter of fact about how it wouldn't work. When the baby was cleaned up, we went back to the living room and were greeted with the biggest, cat-caught-the-canary, smirk on my mother's face. We sat down and she said, ""You should be careful what you say in the room with the baby monitor.""  


&amp;#x200B;

And y'all. That new mom spine showed up. ""Yes,"" I said. ""We learned that when you were on the phone with Aunt.""  


&amp;#x200B;

The smirk froze and then in an instant turned to horror.  Horror because her daughter dared talk back to her. Horror because she had been robbed of the gloating that she was so certain she was about to enjoy. But mainly horror because she had been sitting there stewing. And in her mind, she had worked herself up into believing that being overheard on the baby monitor was SHAMEFUL. And anyone who was overheard saying anything unflattering on the monitor deserved to be embarrassed and ashamed. So with that designated as the proper response in her mind, now that she had been caught out for that very thing, she had to be embarrassed and ashamed. And it was awesome. My JYSF chuckled and they left shortly after.

"My DH and I recently got married about 2 months ago, it’s been a dream as fair as our personal life, and we’re expecting a little bean in a few months.

But my MIL refuses to acknowledge that we’re married, refuses to acknowledge I exist, refuses to acknowledge my pregnancy, basically just acts like I don’t exist. 

She recently tried to set him up with the niece of one of her friends. The poor girl shows up to MILs house with her aunt thinking it’s just a simple visit and is met with my MIL bombarding her trying to introduce them, then gestured to me, holding hands with my husband, visibly pregnant and goes “Don’t worry about her, she’s just his little slut.”

It made me feel like the old MTV show parental control. 

Thankfully the innocent girl politely declined and told her aunt she’d wait in the car for her, and my D(ear)H packed up our things and left, telling his mother she can call him when she comes to her senses, or not at all. 


Family is very important to me but I have no clue how to handle this.


ETA: my husband has never had a good relationship with his mother. I wanted to maybe try to fix that which is why up until now I’ve been maybe a little bit of a doormat. She’s never called me a name to my or my DHs face, and if she had I wouldn’t have taken that abuse, especially pregnant. But I am maybe a little weak and not as ferocious as I once was, because this baby has taken all my anger and replaced it with just crying. That’s my response is crying. I think he’s gonna be a little spitfire. 


Anyway, I know that I need to just cut her off entirely and that’s what I plan to do. Thank you all for your kind, a little stern words. I hope I won’t have to post in this subreddit again, but I have a feeling I may.",JUSTNOMIL
"So some one you might not have the same views as I do and that's okay. I sort of would like to hear everyone's opinion on if I was over reacting?


So this afternoon mother in law invited our family over for a BBQ. We haven't seen DH little sister for a while so DH wanted to go. So I figure I can fake liking MIL for a night. 

Well his sister(17) asked me if I wanted to walk across the street with her to the store to buy a few things. And I ask DH if he would keep an eye on DS( and he said he would. 


When we got back from the store I walk into the house and see DS sitting next to the power outlet pulling on cords that were plugged in and chewing on them. Now he's the part we're I mention he was soaking wet. MIL poured ice chips on the floor for him to play with because she doesn't have AC and it's around 100°. 

Now i asked nicely (because MIL was right next to him and I'm on the other side of the house ) if she would grab him. Well she looked at him said he's fine he's not in any danger. Well I got PISSEd that she wasnt taking it seriously so I ran to him and I picked him up. And I packed up all of our stuff and we left all without me saying a single word to MIL. 


Moments later MIL shows up at our house (a 45 minute drive away) to demand I apologize and how I disrespected her in her own house and that I was very rude because she invited us over and bought all the food for dinner. (Which we didn't eat). She always claims that he outlets are surge protector safe. Which means DS wouldn't be able to electricute himself. (I thought load of bullshit but hey I've been wrong before.)  and I explained I wouldn't apologize and that I felt like my son was in danger and that I acted appropriately. And then I asked her to leave. 

Now my husband is very upset with me for making this all a huge thing and said I should have handled myself better. So I figured I would come here because many of you all understand the justNoMIL stand point and ask you if you all thought I over reacted? 


Also I'd like to apologize for how awful this is written I'm currently in my phone and extremely exhausted from today.",JUSTNOMIL
"Long time reader, first time poster, also on my phone and all that jazz. 

As most start off I never thought I’d post here. My mother in law and I were friends before she was my mother in law. She introduced me to my husband. This past weekend though, she nearly killed my son.

We let our son go on his first trip with my mother in law last weekend. She took him 6 hours away. As we put the car seat in the car we went over his medicine schedule since my son has asthma. We went over how important it is for him to get his maintenance medicine because, you know, asthma. Along the trip I got tons of pictures of him having fun. Everything seemed so great.

Monday comes around and he gets home late in the evening and he has dark circles around his eyes and a cough. My mother in law leaves quickly because she still has to drop off my nephews 2 hours away.  I start unpacking my son’s bag and lo and behold there sits his medicine packs, completely untouched. I texted my mother in law and she says “ I didn’t think he really needed it, he wasn’t coughing much.” Ok first off you weren’t part of us making him therefore you DO NOT get to make medical decisions for him. Second, THIS IS WHY WE DON’T LET YOU SEE HIM UNSUPERVISED!!!

So we started trying to play catch up and get his asthma under control.  Spoiler, it didn’t work. Thursday we wound up in the emergency room and were sent home. Friday was his birthday and he spent it mostly asleep saying he can’t breathe. Sunday we wound up back at the hospital and were admitted. I told him to tell his mother what she’d caused and [this bitch takes zero responsibility.](https://imgur.com/a/9wbgASF) So now my poor baby has an IV (he wound up dehydrated also) and has to go through breathing treatments ever 4 hours because she “didn’t think he needed it”.  


We’ve finally gotten his oxygen saturation up to the mid 90s (it was in the 80s) and should get discharged tonight.",JUSTNOMIL
"My partner and I recently announced our second pregnancy to our parents, and then to social media. My MIL called DH and asked why wasn't she told sooner, and he told her it was because he didnt want to yet. She was angered by the response, told my first child hello, and then hung up. She knew I was in the room (was stated earlier), and did not acknowledge it at all. 3 days passed, and she hasn't called, texted, mentioned me, the pregnancy, or anything of the matter. THEN she shares my social media post as if nothing happened (and has yet to speak to us about it). 

1. I feel like she called and tried to make it about her, then got upset when she didn't get the response she wanted 
2. She's getting congratulated left and right on social media, but has yet to congratulate her own son, so I feel like the post was just for attention.
3. The REAL reason she didn't know sooner, is because she made my first pregnancy a living hell. She constantly made comments about me not eating enough (not true), she would act shocked when I ate around her, she kept tabs on my prenatal appointment times, and called literal minutes after every single appointment to ask how much I weigh, and shamed me the one appointment I didn't gain weight... I had a melt down in the OB office because of it. My DH telling her ""because I didnt want to"", when she asked why wasn't she told sooner was putting it nicely. 
 
I don't want to speak to her. I feel like at this point,  whatever she has to say is fake/forced. She is trying to act like the whole thing never happened. So NOW if we address it, she's going to act innocent. Should I address the situation anyway?",JUSTNOMIL
"To preface, this will be a long one, I'll try to condense as much as possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

Previous to our son being born, my SO and I moved in with his mother at her insistence to start saving for a home. We agreed with a 1-year max goal of purchasing a space of our own. She lives in a very large 6 bedroom house by herself and seemed quite excited to have us join her. We currently occupy the 3 bedroom portion of her basement where we mostly keep to ourselves and leave her to her own routine as often as possible. In exchange for our space, we pay a small amount in rent to help with the electric, etc. bills and I have taken over most of the house and yard duties (I'm a SAHM and really don't mind, it keeps me busy). As of a few months ago, my SO and she started disagreeing. Everything from his job, his health, his parenting, his schedule, anything, really. I did my best to stay out of it, mostly because they were being quite petty with one another and I didn't feel the need to interject and cause further drama but in my opinion, she was berating him constantly. Then the small oddities started occurring. Little rules such as no drinking in her home (she never had a problem beforehand and we drink maybe once a month, if at all), not using the dish drying rack (she \*never\* does dishes by the way, I take care of them), not parking where we have agreed to park from day 1, only using very, very specific spots in the fridge and pantry (she also doesn't eat at home that often and has maybe a carton of milk and a few yogurts in the fridge, everything else is preperation items and leftovers from family meals that I make for everyone, including her) . All very weird, petty things that aren't even worth diving deeper into. SO and MIL by this point have had a few extremely heated berating arguments and we were finally told to move out immediately. She ""can't live like this."" We accepted that we were going to have to use a chunk of our savings for a rental and found something that very weekend. When we informed her of our plans, she apologized and felt horrible that we would be using our funds for a rental instead of towards a home. We all agreed that we should stay. Not even a week later, SO and MIL engage in another heated argument and she threatens to call child protective services because he is abusive (for the record, he isn't abusive IN THE LEAST, not to me, not to our children, he's just fed up with her constant put-downs). This is when I finally started getting involved. When it comes to my children, I will not have someone threatening to have them removed from my custody. In hindsight, I realized later she would have no grounds for such a thing and it would be impossible to actually follow through with, but I digress. Things calmed down once again but only for a moment. While making breakfast for the family, MIL included (this is just days ago), she arrives in the kitchen to start talking down to my SO yet again. He loses it, she leaves the home out of anger, and we are left with PAGES of texts of our abusive behavior towards her and we need to be out of her house immediately (again). For the very first time in the 6 months we have lived there, I stand up for my family. I respond back to her texts with my own choice words of HER abusive behavior towards us. We get home to multiple eviction notices scattered around the home which I promptly gathered and tossed in her room while yelling at her to just leave us alone along with other choice words because by this point, I was incredibly fed up with her and her drama, especially after attempting to forgive her for the Child Protective Services threat. In front of me, she then calls the police and tells them I am threatening violence and trespassing. We gather the children and leave the house immediately. I spoke to the police officer on scene through a phone call and explain what actually happened and that we are rent-paying tenants of her home and will be returning. He agrees that we are allowed to and we go home. It's been a horror show ever since we arrived. We do not have the time, energy, or funds to move out with such immediacy (my god, we need \*at least\* a week to find a rental, not an afternoon). Constant eviction noticed plastered around the home, stomping about whenever we are in the kitchen, blocking my car so I cannot leave, insert a million other passive aggressive actions here. Not to mention, I am no longer allowing her near my children or myself. It's very clear she's mentally unstable and understandably, I don't feel safe around her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Phew, that was a mouthful. If you made it this far, bless you, you're a Rockstar Reader. We have no idea how to navigate our living situation while we rental hunt. This person we are living with is a monster. She is abusive, she is aggressive, and now she is making things up to actual police officers in an attempt to have me arrested. I am worried she will succeed, I am worried she will go after my children (I am sending the oldest to stay with my parents in another state until we find a new home, I don't want him near the drama), and I am worried she will damage or alter our things while we are not home. I have gone in and out of crying out of actual shock that a person could do this to someone else they previously (at least, seemingly) cared about. How do we do this?",JUSTNOMIL
"So I’m back already. 

Thank you to everyone who commented yesterday. It was very validating to hear that DH and I weren’t in the wrong for hosting separate celebrations for our families. 

I thought based on what happened yesterday we’d get at the very minimum a single months reprieve from MIL. Instead DH comes home from work today bearing “good” news. 

Mil has apologized for lashing out at him yesterday stating she “has to come to terms” with how “it’s going to be from now on.”  

Basically to sum up her text (I don’t have DH’s phone and I don’t want to ask for it) she’s sorry to DH, and needs time to adjust to me not wanting her around people of my religion. THIS IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL! She’s completely missed the point of us separating our parties! And not only that, but no where was there an apology for saying the things she did about myself nor my family! 

DH says he’s still upset with her but I don’t feel like he’s upset for the reasons he should be. I tried talking to him about it today but it just ended with him being defensive and saying that we aren’t hosting separate events from now on. Everyone is just either going to have to deal with it or not come because he’s not dealing with something like this again. I won’t get more into this because I know this is a DH problem at this point and that’s not what this particular sub is about. 

I’m very upset and feel like this was a nonapology from MIL. She’s more than likely going to expect things to go back to the way they were after a little bit of time has passed. I don’t think I can do that. She’s hurt our relationship very deeply at this point and I want nothing to do with her for the foreseeable future. Nor do I really want my son to have anything other than a superficial relationship with this woman. I know I can’t keep DS away from her realistically to DH she’s still his mom and he very much wants her in our sons and his life. 

Not looking forward to the next few months at all. I feel like I have a cloud hanging over me.


Edit: So I have slept on this and now I’m just PISSED. I’m mad that she thinks she can pull this crap with DH. I’m mad she threatened him with their relationship over something like this. I’m mad about her comments about me. I’m mad she hasn’t even hinted at an apology to me for the things she said. She will not be welcome in our home for some time. I deserve just as much as my husband to be comfortable in my home and she does not fit into that picture right now. She will also not be seeing myself nor my son for some time. Until she acknowledges what she said and has said behind my back was hurtful and can sincerely apologize.",JUSTNOMIL
"So I posted recently about my MIL who was put off by my ""bad energy"" and said she wasnt going to come over to our new house for a very long time. Well that didnt last, shortly after we had a housewarming with my family and invited his as well and she showed up! Kept to herself basically the entire time and didn't engage in any socializing but everyone else had a great time and me and SO  just took it as closing the door on that situation.

Fast forward to this past weekend, my baby shower. My mom and aunt very graciously planned the whole thing out and it was lovely! The only thorn in my side was that MIL decided not to come. After the housewarming I was feeling good about things moving forward, she had helped us purchase the crib and things seemed to be looking up. Keep in mind that she has known the date, location, etc of the baby shower for months at this point. My mom had made an attempt to involve her in the planning and she told my mom ""no it's okay do what you want"".

Me and SO head out towards the shower when he receives a phone call through the Bluetooth system in his car from MIL. Her first question is if we are in the car together, he says yes and they begin speaking in Spanish. Now I wouldn't consider myself exactly fluent but I think they highly underestimate just how much I actually understand. I hear her saying how she doesnt think she's coming. She doesnt know anyone, she has no gifts to bring it'll make her look bad, its too far (my mom lives about 45 minutes away), she'll be the odd one out, amongst other things that I didnt quite catch. He keeps saying ""please come, for me"" she repeatedly says no, they continue this back and forth until she eventually says okay fine. 

His summary to me of this conversation was basically ""oh she just feels bad because she doesnt have gifts to bring since shes already given them to us, but she's about to leave"". So now I know that MIL doesn't really want to be there but am satisfied that shes atleast still willing to suck it up and come. We arrive and not 5 minutes later SO gets a text and says ""my mom cant come, she says its raining too hard to drive."" He accepts this excuse fully however I'm confused as to why she would be attempting to leave at the time the shower began and not the 40 minutes earlier she said she was? Me and SO live not 10 minutes from her so we know the weather wasn't bad til later. 

I brush it off for the moment and enjoy the event. Later on when we head home I mention to him that I did feel hurt that she didn't show up as this is her first grand child and it was important to us. He tries to make excuses for her and confessed that she didnt feel comfortable coming. This struck a cord remembering back to her extreme lack of understanding of my anxiety (see my last post) and the fact that I've pushed through being uncomfortable for her benefit many times already and had even been considering letting her be in the room for the birth despite having no real desire for her to be there, for my SO and her since it is her first grandchild.

After this I don't think I want to have her in the room. Her actions are beginning to concern me more for our future relationship and her relationship with my child. Would it be wrong of me to only have my mom and SO in the room? Am I over reacting to this situation?",JUSTNOMIL
"My SO has now been dealing with a huge guilt trip shit storm and I'm feeling kind of guilty that he has to deal with this. 

MIL is in full temper tantrum mode. Sobbing, threatening to move far far away, more crying and is now getting FIL to relay her messages because she's just so upset. Unfortunately, the guilt tripping and hearing about her tears seems to be having an effect on SO. For the life of me I can't understand why, it's her same old song and dance that we've been through many times. 

They have accused me of some bizarre and impossible things considering our LO isn't even born yet. Obviously I'm going to deny them access to the baby at all costs. I'm going to be overbearing and strict about 'silly things like feeding and naps with the baby'. I won't let her have a phone when she's older. I'm going to be worse than nephew's mom. Blahblahblah. I don't know where any of this came from because I've never talked about any of these things with them. 

I've received texts saying that I'm portraying MIL as a monster, I'm wrong. I'm being petty and surmising horrible things. I need video evidence of her behaviour. I should have had a conversation with them (funny because they've never extended the same courtesy to me and when I have tried MIL throws a temper tantrum complete with crocodile tears, yelling and running away to slam doors because that's ""just the way she is""). I've placed SO in the middle of this, they're now my family so I can't act this way, then it was finished off with some strange lovebombing and guilt tripping about how SO's grandma isn't feeling well. 

Worst part is that SO is definitely back in the FOG. He doesn't want to talk too much about all this shit because it 'stresses him out and they ARE his parents' but he did want to ask me if I'm okay with them babysitting once my maternity leave is up. What in the actual fuck. Obviously my response was fuck no, over my dead fucking body. We've talked in the past about no unsupervised visits. The woman almost killed our dog for god's sake, not trusting her with my fucking child. 

All I can say is that I'm thankful for a supportive mom, sister and this community otherwise I'd be feeling pretty fucking alone right now. This is supposed to be a happy time for SO and I and this stupid woman has yet again made it all about her simply because she couldn't respect the one boundary I tried to put in place of 'I don't want to be her friend right now.'",JUSTNOMIL
"Keeping this short and sweet. I'm still with my kids. I have no idea what's going on with anything that Hag stirred up yet. Still feeling defeated.       
          
Here's the good news. Hag left town. Even with everything she stirred up while she was in town, she didn't even get what she wanted. She did not get a hold of my children. I don't know how I managed to keep her nasty inbred claws away from my children, but I did. They are safe for now.         
        
Not so good news. Right before she left town, she told husband ""We have rights as grandparents!"". He said this himself. I have no clue if he said it to scare me or what, but I still prevented her from getting her claws on them. I won't be surprised if she's currently preparing to sue for rights. Welp.

"This issue was handled already but I am sure it will have long lasting consequences. At least it does for those who are not me, namely the aunt in this story and the Red Rocket.

The same week I went no contact with Red Rocket, actually just a day or two before, I got a text from her sister. It isn’t unheard of for me to get a direct message from the sisters (there are two, they function as a set). But this was different.

For context the first message was accompanied by a picture of my post on a local neighborhood group (that bitch isn’t even supposed to be in because she lives in another state and it is a closed FB group). All I said in the post was that I needed cheap Christmas lights because I was planning to use my MiL’s extra but she had sold them. Also we are atheist and raise our children secularly but Red Rocket has nagged me to decorate our house for Christmas so she can see lights from inside her house. She said it wasn’t fair we could see her lights and she didn’t get the same. I love lights and was all for it.

So, for your reading enjoyment, I give you the time I tried to mitigate the shit Red Rocket says behind my back with the nicer of DH’s two aunts:

**Aunt**: Did you see this  give me give me give me I'm like Red Rocket starting to hate her what a brat snot and anything else Why is it we want every thing given to us I'm sorry but that is how I feel and I thought you didn't believe in Santa and the lights and decorations go with Christmas I'm totally confused by you no wonder it is hard

**Me**: What? Red Rocket has offered us her extra lights because she wanted us to put lights on our house. She forgot and sold them. I still want to surprise dS1 (and Red Rocket, but I can't put that in a public post that I know she will see) and I want to do it for as cheap as possible. I have bought two sets for $2 from this post so far and found a thrift shop that has them for cheaper than the store.

That's all the post is about. What does your message mean?

This is AUNT, right?

**Aunt**: Yes and I don't appreciate you putting she forgot it is only for drama just post you are in need of extra things that is like Taking a jab at her I have to feel for Red Rocket as that would just upset her more She is already torn about leaving adding to her anxiety won't help

**Me**: I only put that as an explanation for why I want just running off to buy new at the store. 

I don't appreciate you assuming that I am jabbing anything at Red Rocket. I am not at all angry with her and I am really heartbroken over her leaving. Before she blew up at me and called me an unfit mother and tried to interfere in my marriage (all that happened out of the blue in two days) I felt like she was a mom to me. We understand that she is homesick and just want her to be happy.

I am trying to be as supportive of her decisions as possible and help her get wherever she wants to go whenever she wants, including moving. Every time we are together she talks excitedly about what she imagines her life will be like back in Shittsville and it makes me incredibly sad that she is leaving, but I do not want to punish her for it or have anger in any way. 

I suspect she is telling you a different version of what life was like here for her to make it easier to come home. 

**Aunt**:  Not really she is homesick she was too isolated in a big city

**Me**: She is telling us that I am too controlling and she doesn't know why DH ever married me. She accused us of allowing the dog to sexually assault DS. She accused me of elder abuse for cursing. She's picking fights to push us away so it is easier for her to move.

We aren't taking the bait anymore (not since the dog incident, since it was so out there we thought it was a joke at first) and are continuing to live peacefully. I know her anxiety is high so we are trying to take her lead on contact so we don't stress her out. 

I hope you don't believe all that she says about us. The things she says when she is mad indicate that she is saying things about us that may not be accurate when she isn't mad. After your visit she started talking about how her BUSINESS stuff was us taking advantage of her but she always decided where the money went and if we were going to look for STOCK. We didn't take money from it, she decided what it would be spent on. But her feelings towards it seemed to change and we tried to go along with that too. We've tried to accommodate all the projects she has shown interest in.

Anyway, frankly, I intend to make sure that I honor my promise to take care of her while she is here and make sure that I support her in her transition. 

I have pushed fairly hard for her to treat her anxiety because it is driving a lot of her daily life, even in retirement. I hope she finds a path to happiness.

**Aunt**:  (no response)

Oh my god I just re-read the first thing you sent and I realized if I add punctuation it makes sense. And that you didn't mean to send it to me and you are saying you hate me. 

Um, yeah. Okay. I guess I really do know what Red Rocket says behind our backs.

**Aunt**: No I'm saying I'm like her and basically everyone else that I'm am starting to hate everyone and their little comments I was so upset I type faster than I think and I do read things out of text sometime but I'm am still upset with this give me world and no one wants to work and earn their own way

**Me**: So you think I am lazy because I made a post asking about Christmas lights? I paid for the damn things. Or is it because I stay home with my kids? 

If I worked my kids couldn't go to their IMPORTANT MEDICAL STUFF. 

I don't want things given to me. I'd love to work. But my work is here making sure my kids have the best step forward in life they can possibly have. If me trying to find a deal on Facebook is so offensive to you that you feel you need to say you hate me, then maybe you should apologize. 

No modifiers. Just an apology would be nice.
.......

No apology ever arrived. Shocker, I know. 

So now for the pettiest or revenges. I continued to gather lights and then hit Walmart to buy strands that specifically did not match what I had already gathered. We did the worst decorating job we could. Strings hung mismatched and limply off the the windows and porch. I pooled a long red strand under the porch to make it look like someone bled out there in glowing lights. But we took all the lights that matched and put them neatly on the inside of the fence so we could see them looking nice, but she couldn’t. She could only see the front of our house and it looked like we tortured elves for fun and led a coup against Santa. 

We left the lights up far too long. Red Rocket left 2/20 and we had them up until 3/1. I wanted to take them down 2/21 but it was snowing for a week. I also left them on all the time, no timer. 

Next year our lights will be amazing.",JUSTNOMIL
"My husband and I just moved into a new house and the next day I had to go to another state with family. She came to visit during this time to “help” husband unpack. I was all for it, time without me! I had the baby with me so she didn’t get to spend time with him and extended the trip so she’d be here when we arrived. 

I get home to: things stuffed in random drawers (plus things she brought, she’s moving so we get the stuff she doesn’t want- only we don’t want it either), a table by the front door is the worst thing. Photos of her house?! And pictures of my husband as a kid. It’s not that she doesn’t realize I don’t like her taste- it’s her making it a
Home for herself.  

A random workout piece I had was stuffed in the linen closet. So I pull it out to put it in the right place, and sat it in the living room until taking it to the garage. She threw it away. When I caught it she said I must not have needed it since I “got it out”. She has no concept of things having specific places, so despite her help- I had to move everything she unpacked/ even find everything. 

And then the big one. She sat with him one morning for me to catch a nap and i woke up to her in the living room. I walked past her to get to baby’s room and I could tell she was trying to get there first. Found baby in crib -on stomach, with two blankets. 

We’ve been over the rules. She knows them. Because she launched into excuses. “I was closely watching him!” (From a different room?) “it was safe with my kids!” (No, it wasn’t safe then either. Even if they told you that.) “he sleeps better on his stomach!” (Yes, I know. But it’s not about comfort, it’s about safety.)

The the line that pushed too far “please don’t tell on me!” 

Don’t tell my husband because you know he’ll be mad? We both make the rules. She’s just his mom so he gets the honor of talking to her about things like this   

She left while I was at the pediatrician with baby, partially because husband called her and to avoid our anger. 

I’m hurt and don’t know what to do. Are there second chances to things like this? It makes me fearful of what other rules she’ll ignore.",JUSTNOMIL
"I don't know how many will remember or know me but my MIL is the one who seasoned pumpkin with chicken stock which could have killed me had I eaten any and sent it home with DH for me to eat. She apologized, not really, but then let FIL verbally abuse me and stood back and smiled. There is more but that's the main trigger event. Oh btw we have a young DD who is now 16months and their only grandbaaaaaby. Veggie Devil (VD - MIL), has sent lies and gossiped and complained about myself and my mother from the get go but I was great when I was pregnant in her eyes, I am/was just an incubator to her. FIL is a prick too but that's for another sub.

The latest is we tried to go no contact obviously that didn't work for them after seeing DD at church from afar. They agreed to talk about things but then FIL blew it all up called it off. Well at a church gathering Veggie Devil had a flying monkey of of father (GFIL) come to DH and say that he needed to talk to his mother and that he doesn't need to tell (me) if he talks to her, and so on. This pissed me off greatly. Veggie Devil is a crafty bitch. 

My mother, who is my carer, went to talk to GFIL and tell him please stay out of it and that I am really hurt by him saying what he said and that I wouldn't be bringing DD around. Well their son who we will call Uncle Asshole came into their house while my mum was there and screamed abuse at her saying he knew everything and that she and I were evil and brainwashed and manipulated DH into doing our bidding and that she is a hypocrite and an unchristian etc .. the only way he could 'know' is if VD has been gossiping and spreading lies about us. GMIL ushered him out and mum finished what she went there to do and tried explaining their daughter is a liar. My mum came home crying and talking to a minister of our church filling them in. I have never seen her this distressed and angry. 

Then at 11:30pm someone threw a rock at our front window where bub was sleeping luckily the window didn't break and the metal awning stopped it and the rock broke. We believe its GC SIL2 this is right up her valley. All of this is because of my bitch of a MIL. And her lies.

When DHs birthday rolled around a couple of weeks ago she sent a long gaggy text ""22 years you came into my life and I was so happy because God brought a son to me!...etc"" 

I know this doesn't make any sense, any questions please ask, I'm just so confused and don't know what to do. All of this is MILs fault she sent the pumpkin, she tried to poison me, she never apologized, she lies saying we deny her a normal grandma relationship saying she can't see or touch DD whenever she wants, she has never offered to help, she only sees her wants. Selfish bitch.

Edit: I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense.",JUSTNOMIL
"Posted this in different sub and was directed here, so a rather long and long-accumulated rant ahead, I apologise. 

Mothers day- MIL already kicked up a fuss, first by insisting it was a week earlier than it really was. Fine, DH took her to dinner then and we thought we were done. Come the actual week, she STILL kept on at DH with ""what are you doing for MEEEE on mothers day?"" Geez woman, he took you to dinner the week before when you insisted it was mothers day. DH wanted to spend the day with just our own family, because it's my first mothers day and tells her as much. ""sorry, but Sunday itself we have our own plans, I'll see you for dinner on Monday."" Reasonable, right? NOPE. She goes on a tirade about how he's UNGRATEFUL and Monday is NO LONGER MOTHERS DAY and my favourite: ""tell your wife to STOP HER NONSENSE"". (Yes, because whenever DH says no to you, it HAS to be MY fault.) DH, bless him, stood his ground (despite me telling him to just give in to her because I was so tired of the drama) and we spent Sunday on our own and he saw her on Monday (albeit with me in a huge ball of anxiety the whole weekend afraid of what she might pull). 

Meanwhile, I guess she isn't happy with the fact that DH regularly has dinner with her once every two weeks (he has a demanding job and we have a 6 month old, we Don't have the time or energy for any more of her), because she randomly and regularly blows up his phone with texts along the following lines of : ""be firm with your wife, don't let her control you, don't let her yell at you"" etc, and these come COMPLETELY out of the blue with Zero prior context or link. There's also been  ""If you need to travel for work, Go, your wife should not hold you back, tell her off, you can't be stuck earning X amount forever, and anyway, she has a nanny. I know you can do better."" 

 SO MUCH there that is absolutely out of line.

1. Travel? BOTH DH and I agreed when we got engaged, that neither of us would travel for work. That wasn't the kind of married/family life we wanted, so I quit an extremely good job too because it involved yearly travel. And his job has never involved travel anyway. But all that aside, it's Our decision and Nothing to do with You, so why are you telling him this?
2. Absolutely, cloak your insanity in pretending to be concerned about his finances. Meanwhile, this woman earns More than Both my parents combined, and is STILL taking money from DH every month. This knowing that we're now tight with a new baby and its related expenses. 
3. ""Anyway she has a nanny""- Wow. So does having a nanny mean he gets to slack off parenting? I have a nanny because I have a full time job. (Unlike her, she did not, And had a nanny, but hey, that's a different story altogether.) And even with a nanny, I do not believe in completely outsourcing the raising of my child, so I bring Both baby and nanny with me to work where I can still be there to keep an eye on things and see my daughter all day. And once we get home, I take over baby because again, it's MY kid. So I still parent much of the day And work And make sure DH's needs are met- dinner is always on the table for him when he gets home for instance. My God, Why do I even feel the need to have to defend myself against such toxicity?
4. I am going to assume by ""you can do better"", she was purely referring to his job and earning potential. But somehow, I also do know that she definitely believes he could have 'done better' in other ways too, if you get what I mean.
5. The whole strain of general disrespect for his wife. Amazing. And yet, you think I should respect You?

Well, now Fathers Day is coming up and you'd think we'd be safe (she and FIL are divorced and FIL lives continents away). But NO, DH gets a text of ""Sunday is Fathers Day. I'm doing lunch. Bring the baby to my house at x time"".

Excuse me? Not even ""would you like to come over""? And who the hell are you to dictate when and where I should bring my baby? And more importantly, WHAT DOES FATHERS DAY EVEN HAVE TO DO WITH YOU?

DH tells her No, we have our own plans on the weekend and he'll see her for dinner on Monday as is when they usually meet. AGAIN she throws a HUGE tantrum, sending him unending guilt trip texts when he's AT WORK, Refusing to back down and insisting she wants to SEE THE BABY and that she hasn't seen baby in a long time.

Right. Woman, You haven't seen baby in a long time because You got mad at me for setting a perfectly valid boundary (she wanted DH to do her work for her. Literally, what She is PAID to do. DH was busy, she wouldn't take no from him, so I texted her to tell her no) and ceased all contact with me, much less arrange visits with baby. Also, you've been texting him long strings of text about how he should 'keep his wife in check' and 'not let her control you' etc etc among other things, showing blatant disrespect for me, so why would I WANT you around me much less my child?

Finally though, she successfully guilt trips DH into agreeing to a visit this Saturday.

DH and I discuss it and set a time for her to come over in the afternoon with limits because we already have plans to work around.

Cue the following exchange:

DH: come over at x time on Saturday then, but we have another appointment at xx time so don't be late (she is HORRIBLE at keeping to set times)

MIL: Where are we having lunch?

DH: we're not, just come over

MIL: but I need to eat. Why are you being this way, and you call yourself a Christian (seriously woman? ""I need to eat""?? Are you incapable of feeding yourself? Grab a bite before you come over?) 

DH: lunch period is usually when LO has a nap, so we won't be going out then. You said you want to see LO so come over at that time when she will be awake

MIL: I don't need to see LO, just (only) you \[ie, only DH\] will meet me at x place to eat.

ALL. OF. MY. OH. MY. GODS.

So tired of arguing with crazy that we gave in and DH will meet her for lunch. Way to take your son away from his family on our very precious weekends. AND his first fathers day weekend at that.

And you Insist on wanting to see LO, we literally ask you to come over, and then you do another 180? My mind.. is just blown.",JUSTNOMIL
"This is a bit of a short one. As many who've read my posts here may know my future MiL is crazy. Yesterday evening my fiance and I were planning on meeting up at my synagogue for a holiday event in which everyone got a free treat from an ice cream truck. Just show up, go to the truck, get anything off the menu free. Very innocent if you're a normal human. 

Well, before he left MIL, who is hyper-catholic, asked him where he was going. He told her about the event and she lost it. She went off for a while and basically told him that going to my temple is a slippery slope and that he's going to hell. In what I can only picture as the most flamboyant outrage MiL uttered the sentence ""You're risking your Immortal Soul for ice cream!"" 

My fiance has been taking it in stride, though I can tell he's kinda upset by it too. I've been trying to be supportive but also the idea that accepting Jewish ice cream will send someone to Hell is just the funniest thing.",JUSTNOMIL
"So, long time reader - first time poster. Long post. TL/DR; JNMIL is upset we aren't sending our DS to stay a couple weeks with her over the summer. I'm thinking of giving in and letting him go.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a reformed JNM who is now 100% JY(!) and my former JYMIL is now an aggravatingly JNMIL.  Make sense?

The important backstory is that when I met D(ear)H 8 years ago, my relationship with my mom was toxic. MIL at the time I met her seemed so JY! I was young and so sweetly naive. Ah, the lack of boundaries I had.... Well fast forward 5 years and my mom goes through some intensive therapy and consciously works on her own shit. It has been amazing. Like, I could actually tell her that I didn't emotionally trust her. She apologized - so many times over the years I've told her we're absolutely good now. \*\*Go to therapy! It 's the dopest of dope.

JYMIL takes this same amount of time and basically degrades into a DARVO manipulative succubus.

An important piece of family info here: DH had a 2yo son when I met him. We got married when DS was 3yo. JNMIL up to that point had been the only ""rationally stable"" person in DH life - albeit she lives across the country. DS is the first and only bio grandchild she'd had (up until we had a baby this year. woop.). Of course DH is also the GC....

Conflict started brewing when we would go visit JNMIL on her horse ranch. If I would discipline DS (a toddler misbehaving? never.) She would take him out of time out behind my back and apologize to him for ME. I am DS full time mom and have an awesome bond with the kiddo. He's always been my number one and my motivation. The disrespect was shocking but I let it go as I was still newer to her family. I keep on over the years driving with DH to see her for our summer vacations. Things just subtly downgraded every time with her. She started piling on the emotional baggage. She needed you to know how much of a victim she'd been her entire career and life in general. It wasn't enough that she bled out on us adult children though, she started doing it to my DS.

See, that's a problem for me. I cannot stand adults who use children for emotional support. Especially kiddos who've been neglected and abandoned by their parent. Which DS had been by his bio mom when he turned 5yo. She just up and moved across the country with his half sister. She didn't call for a year. He went through a really rough time and I was the person he had to fall on as the SAHM.... I digress

So time goes on and I bring up to DH every now and again how I have these vague issues here and there. He agrees but neither of us are committed (read lazy) to actually confronting the woman we only see a few times a year. As DS gets a bit older we start letting him go see JNMIL a week ahead of us coming out to visit her. The last couple years we've let him and his cousin go out and come back without us going at all. This worked because I and DH were working full time. Free two weeks of childcare in the summer is a huge relief.

Last year though things came to a bit of a head and I told DH that JNMIL needed some serious boundaries set. He agreed and we drafted a letter to her. It was not received well. She accused me of being a controlling/gatekeeping/GC stealing/ hormonal/ bitch. DH and his slowly shining spine defend me and himself and basically told her to get with the program or kick rocks. We go VLC throughout the year (which, yes I was pregnant with twins at the time.) she and I were completely NC and still are VVVVVVVVVVLC. DH knows I won't let her emotionally unload on our new baby (only one twin survived birth. screw preeclampsia.) and that I'm really not interested in DS going to visit JNMIL this summer. I'm home full time now so we don't need the help with childcare.

JNMIL of course already planned on DS coming to visit and had FIL take two weeks off of work. Did they tell us the dates before hand? Nooope. Just figured we'd drive 10 hours round trip to drop DS off with no concern to our own summer plans. Well DH texts her after I said hell no. Let's her know that it's really not going to work out this summer but that she's more than welcome (ugh) to come for a 4 day weekend to see the kids. She's been a little bitchy about it. Brought back up that she forgot she has ""boundaries she's forced to bend to"" (no shit? like, that's how boundaries work..). 

The problem I'm having here is about DS. He loves his grandma and we've done a lot to make sure he's had consistent access to her as he wants. This is the first year he won't be going out there in 10 years. Should I suck it up and take him out there? Reestablish the rules with JNMIL and hope for the best?",JUSTNOMIL
"JNMIL is in town for LO's baptism and it's the first time I've seen her since she was here for 7 weeks after LO's birth. We saw her on Friday and she cried almost the entire time because I wouldn't let her kiss me (see my last post for the full story). After that I was VERY concerned that she would pull something at LO's baptism on Sun.

Luckily, my JYFamily is also in town for the baptism and that made it very difficult for JNMIL to make the day about her. JNMIL usually tries to take over things, but we made sure that didn't happen. We hired a caterer and my JYFamily brought a ton of beautiful flower arrangements and helped decorate the day before. My aunt also gave a little speech and thanked everyone for coming to our party, which may have been her subtle way of telling JNMIL not to overstep. 

Despite JNMIL's bad behavior on Friday, she was on her very best behavior at the baptism party. She told me that I look stunning, that I'm a wonderful mother, and that the party was beautiful. She was laying it on thick. She even left the party at a reasonable time. I suspect that she was putting on a bit of a show (narc mask) or maybe she didn't feel like she could away with her usual b.s. with my JYFamily around. Either way, I'm very relieved that things went so smoothly for LO's baptism.

After LO was born, JNMIL said some things that made it clear that she expected that LO and I would become enmeshed with her family and that my family would fade into the background. Hopefully this weekend forces her to realize that she can't push my family out of the picture. 

Anyway, I'm VERY grateful to this community- your support and advice helped me to relax and focus on LO this weekend.  Xo",JUSTNOMIL
"My mil is a nutcase. Over the past 6 years, I've just kind of accepted that she is so outrageously passive aggressive and inappropriate that it's almost an art. I don't have a super close relationship with her, but I do try my best to keep her grandchildren in her life and send pictures and updates and stuff. 

I have learned to mostly ignore her passive aggressive comments and remarks and her insults thinly veiled as jokes. But there are some occasions where she is just so unnecessarily rude that I have to speak up and stop talking to her. My babyshower was one of those occasions.

 I had my daughter in early February. Her due date was March 3rd, but because of some seriously scary issues, we decided to take her early. The issues are in my post history if you want to look. Basically a rare, life threatening condition. 

So, the shower was planned for late feb by my best friend. She and I have our issues right now, but she went above and beyond to give me a nice shower. I invited mil and she invited one of her friends. cool. So the week before the shower, all of our kids were sick. My newborn was sniffling, my 5 year old had a cold, her 5 year old had a cold, and my step mom was(and still is) recovering from lung cancer treatment. She cannot be around any sick people. We decided to push the shower back a week. 

I told my mil and she got mad. She decided she was going to do the shower herself and invite all of her friends, on the original date. I told her not to do that and that I wanted to go to my friends shower. She got mad at me, and said she had already invited everyone. I told her I did not ask her to do that, and I am not going. I tried to explain why and she just sighed and rolled her eyes. I actually felt guilty although idk why. 

The day of my friend's shower came. MIL decided she was going to attend after all. I was at home getting myself and my kids ready and I get a text from my friend ""Rivsmama please hurry up and get here! Helppp!"" I thought to myself, ""oh shit. mil is there early. ""

 Apparently mil walked up to the door with her 70 year old friend, holding a cupcake box, and while my friend was trying to help mil's friend get in the door, mil sighed loudly and said "" you're not going to help me carry anything??!"" to my friend. She made a few other rude comments and then stood in friends living room until I got there. I found this out later.

I show up, super happy and excited and when I walk in the door, mil makes a comment about me hogging the baby and that she's glad she came all the way here to see everyone else holding her. I ask her if she wants to hold the baby, she rolls her eyes. So I gave her to my sister in law. 

My friend is very crafty and made some really cool decorations using felt and baby diapers. I commented on how neat they were and said, ""I wish I had the patience to learn how to do this."" My mil scoffed and said, ""well you're a mother now, so you need to learn patience. "" I have a 5 year old and 2 older kids, but apparently I only became a mother after my daughter was born idk.

 Later on, we're playing games and my friend would start a nursery rhyme and the game was you had to finish the lyric, by writing it down. I did pretty well, but had some trouble with a couple. We were all laughing and pretending to cheat and making up silly sentences and just having fun, and my mil pipes up from the corner, "" Rivsmama don't you think as a mother you should know these? Or I guess you just don't sing to your kids. That's nice."" I ignored her comment and kept talking to the people who actually like me. I'd be lying if I said it wasn't wearing me down though. 

Next, we did presents. This is where shit finally got to be too much. Every present that wasn't clothing, my mil would laugh and ask me if I even knew what the thing was or how to use it. Like I was too stupid to know what a burp cloth or a thermometer was. I tried to ignore her, but I finally got frustrated and said, ""Im not an idiot! Please stop!""

For weeks, my mil had been hounding me to write thank you cards for all the gifts I got and the gifts I was going to receive. I'm not a thank you card type of person, I thought a genuine in person thank you or text was ok, but I was open to the idea at first. Until she started hounding me and insulting me and saying things like you're an adult now, it's time to grow up. And just being super nasty about them. So I go to open her gift, and the first thing was a package of thank you cards. She laughed and said, ""I knew if I left it up to you, it wouldn't have happened. "" And I was pissed. She had treated me like shit at my own baby shower for NO reason and I couldn't take anymore. I tossed the thank you cards to the side and said "" well sorry you wasted your money because I'm not sending any goddamn thank you cards!""

 And she got red and started to stand up and say something, and my sister in law, who is Puerto Rican and very ""blunt"" as we lovingly describe her, had had enough. She tells mil to sit down and stop being so rude. This was supposed to be my day and she had been mean to  me since I walked in the door. My mil says, ""I'm pretty sure it's  'daughter's name' day, not mine."" and then she did her passive aggressive laugh and a few minutes later, left. I was about to cry at this point and just wanted her gone. 

When she left, everyone came up to me and asked who that rude lady, bitch, jerk, etc. was and what was her problem? I stopped talking to mil for almost 2 months after the shower. She finally apologized (non apology) and I decided to just move on, and there have been some small issues since, but I'm starting to get a backbone with her. It's just growing a little slower than I'd like.",JUSTNOMIL
"Thankfully my MIL is having very little to do with our lives lately so I have had nothing to vent about.

Yesterday there was a funny incident with her. We met them in the city as my husband had something to pick up from his father. While we were there my son found some sand and was happily digging at it with a stick for ages. She started to tell my husband how great his sand pit was as a child. For the second time this month. But my husband corrected her again and said “no it was actually not great. We used to dig up cat poo all the time” He was just laughing about it. They were kids and didn’t care at the time. 

I was a little bit away from them so didn’t hear any more of the conversation but next thing she came up and said goodbye to our son and not to me. And got in her car and started driving out of the parking space, while we were still chatting to FIL. 

My husband takes no notice of her so didn’t even acknowledge that she had gone off in a mood.

I asked him what had set her off and he explained that she tried to convince him that his memory of the sand pit he had as a child was wrong and there was never cat poo in it. And they didn’t even have a cat then. 

My husband joked afterwards that he must have imagined spending all his spare time as a child making cats houses and even bring home cats when he went out to farms with his dad. Cats play such a large part of his childhood fond memories so it was extra ridiculous that she tried to claim there were none around.

So we will see how long she refuses to speak to him this time. He is always happy when she does the silent treatment “punishment”.",JUSTNOMIL
"Here’s a (not so) quick recap: 

Hot Lips is my MIL.  She was always overbearing, and nosy, but she became extremely controlling, entitled, obsessive, and passive aggressive after I had my LO almost a year and a half ago.  

I’ll provide a few examples of her behavior.  She destroyed our first week home with LO after he was born.  She barged in on me half naked twice when she heard my LO crying and she refuses to apologize for it.  She completely disregarded boundaries we set (no kissing, no social media, etc.), and then insisted those events never happened.  I was so stressed.  I spent most of my time pumping alone so she could be with LO (I had no spine).  

She selected and made LO’s first Halloween costume (a scarecrow) without asking us, and then became angry when DH said we had one selected.  She snoops through our stuff, but says she doesn’t and claims she isn’t nosy.  Though she vehemently denies it, she tries to parent LO (and us), and she calls LO her baby or her son.  She’s obsessed with LO’s development, and tries to compare LO to other babies.  She’s in a one-sided competition with my parents and said something very cruel to my mom.  

We haven’t seen Hot Lips or FIL since before the holidays (when they made their authority figure claims), and they haven’t received any photos of LO in over 6 months (since they told us we had enough pictures of LO and refused to share a video of LO with us).  We recently got the video.  I assume this is because she’s desperate for pictures of LO.  They acted like they just forgot to send it to us.

I haven’t responded to any communication since they wished life would go back to the way it was before DH married me.  That’s when I told them they were no longer welcome to stay with us when they visit.  They canceled their holiday visit stating that they forgot to buy tickets, but there is no way they actually forgot.  My best guess is that they’re trying to punish us, and she wants us to beg them to come.  They skipped an annual visit this spring, and didn’t even mention it.  And, MIL sent DH an email informing him that they had no plans to visit us anytime soon!  (Great, thank you.) So, she’s basically punishing herself in an effort to punish us.  She has missed out on a lot of LO’s life all because we asked her to respect our privacy and our common sense boundaries (like no swearing in front of LO), and she doesn’t think she should have any boundaries, so she reacted bitterly, refusing to accept our boundaries, making so many passive aggressive comments that I’ve lost count, and refusing to apologize because she’s done nothing wrong.

DH quit video chatting with them a few months ago when Hot Lips asked for parenting feedback she didn’t actually want in a thinly veiled attempt to get pictures of LO.  She got defensive and angry when he gave her feedback, and after a lot of ridiculous emails, she issued a completely fake apology.  

She has since sent me two non-apologies where she expressed regret that I took what they said the wrong way.  She also wrote that I’m important because I’m DH’s wife and LO’s mother (I’m not sure why that was relevant unless she was just looking to insult me).  I think she’s stepping up her efforts to rug sweep because she decided she doesn’t like her current consequences and she wants everything to go back to the way it was (that’s never, ever happening).

DH has been texting with Hot Lips and FIL a few days a week, and calling them about twice a month.  They’ve asked to video chat with LO, but DH told them they’re just going to talk for now.  DH didn’t call this weekend, but he did call last weekend.  During these calls, they have not asked about me once.  It’s clear they blame me for this situation and I’m quite certain she wishes I’d just disappear.  It’s infuriating that I’ve overlooked so much of MIL’s behavior, and I’ve been thoughtful, kind, and respectful toward them, and somehow her inability to be a decent human being is my fault.

Hot Lips and FIL recently got some bad news that they shared with DH via text.  DH responded via text, but didn’t call.  Hot Lips sent the text below this morning.  

“We missed talking with you yesterday and we miss seeing OP and LO!!  With all of our bad news recently, it makes us so sad that our relationship is still in the pits.  What can we do?  We love you so much!  Love, your very sad parents. 😢😢”

How would you respond to that?  She’s asked for feedback before.  If DH tells her we need them to respect our boundaries and our privacy, she says that she doesn’t understand why we keep hitting them over the head with our boundaries.  She often ignores questions DH asks, or she reacts terribly, with mean, passive aggressive, and bitter comments, paragraphs about her hurt feelings, and denials about events that happened.  DH wants to respond, and I think he needs to be more direct this time around.  Things will never be the way they were before; they’ve destroyed my relationship with them as well as my opinion of them.  I don’t trust them and I don’t like them.  Only time will improve things, and if she keeps acting like she doesn’t know what happened, then I will never be able to move forward.

"I was going to post this in letters but that sub is gone now. Please redirect me if necessary.

So our invites went out a couple of weeks ago and after a slight delay TTP and her flying monkeys are at it again.

“Congrats on your engagement and your new job” TTP texted to FH.

Full stop...Wtf are you up to lady? We all know damn well you don’t like me and you and fsil both think I’m stealing FH. (I make such a great scapegoat it might as well be my profession)

If you’re trying to score an invite that ship has sailed and was then engulfed in wildfire and was never seen again.

Flying monkeys...

“Is TTP invited”

“Are our aunts and uncles invited? None of them got an invite? Just so you know they love and support you in everything you do.”

(for the record he hasn’t heard directly from any of the aunts or uncles in over a year, so yeah they totally care)

FH and his shiny ass spine.

“You’re kidding right? Why would I invite my mother after what she’s done?”

“Our aunts and uncles all had the chance to support me when the conflict first started, none of them did. Instead they chose to attempt to make me get back on the boat and make things right when I had done anything wrong. That totally sounds loving and supportive doesn’t it?”

Omg ya’ll I damn near cackled at that last bit.
Much love goes out to FH for not faltering.

So the SS Tiny Tyrannical Pterodactyl has officially began their guilt trip cruise. (This is not their maiden voyage)

It’ll be a delightful affair where they watch our marriage happen from a distance as they alternate between righting TTP’s boat and acting as flying monkeys.

Tiny Tyrannical Pterodactyl I know that you’re probably trying to score an invite for appearances sake. 

I mean god forbid you tell anyone the real reason you weren’t invited to your son’s wedding is because you won’t do the one thing He asked you to (counseling).

It’s going to be hard to keep up appearances when the wedding photos get posted and you’re not in any of them. Good luck with that.

I’ll save you some trouble and authorize you to blame me. Anyone in your family who’s actually bothered to get to know me will know better and those who haven’t can believe what they want since they’re of no importance to me. 

Maybe I’ll talk about this with some of the nice people I’ve clicked with that you have beef with and we can all laugh about it together over cocktails. Turns out we’re all nice people who treat other people like humans. Who’d a thunk it? Turns out the common denominator in all the dramatic equations is you.

Have fun on your guilt trip cruise, and when you land on the dock at scapegoat island don’t forget to say my new last name when you go whispering about me.

Btw guys

I have acquired a lego Pterodactyl that now travels with me everywhere because it’s hilarious and is now on my keys. 

I wonder if LEGO makes monkeys I can glue wings to🤔",JUSTNOMIL
"Isn't it disturbing that some Mean Girls stay that way their entire lives, even at 60+?? It's sad actually isn't it? 

We visited MIL and FIL, who dragged us to a dinner party hosted by their friends. MIL has a crew of biddies  (picture stepford housewives but 60+ years old and South Asian). They're a tight-knit group who also gossip about each other constantly (as per FILs and SILs comments). MIL kept hinting to me that this is a ""dressy dinner"". You see, MIL and SIL are very fancy ladies who are always dressed up in sparkles and lots of florals and bright lipsticks and always have 10 layers of makeup on. No judgement, I believe we should all do what makes us feel good, but MIL was clearly worried about my debutante appearance in front of her homegirls. As a side, I think women are beautiful on a spectrum of styles and there is no one definition of femininity. I'm a young woman in tech, I love working out and hiking etc, so my style is more laidback and natural. Anyways, DH tells MIL that were not here to get fancy for a dinner party, were here to spend time with them. MIL insisted we must come to this dinner and we have to dress up. Sorry girlfriend, I don't carry such clothes for a weekend family visit and frankly I'm not your doll. So I wore black skinny jeans and a nice blouse, did my hair and makeup. My MIL CBF'd hard at me, but keep on suckin your lemons lady, you're lucky I'm even going to this shindig. 

Here's the fun part of the story. DH and I drove separately and when we got there, MIL opened the door and rushed me to the garden where the biddies were all hanging out. Y'all. I don't think I've ever been subjected to more Mean Girl attitude in my life. They each had a Sour Lemon look on their face, looked me up and down with what I would describe as disdain and made zero effort to be friendly or welcoming (I felt like I was in a movie, they were so dramatically rude). It became very clear very quickly that MIL has been talking mad shit about me to these ladies. I generally have thick skin and care very little what people I don't know think of me but it was hella uncomfortable so I dipped out of there and found DH. After telling him I'm uncomfortable and this is stupid, we told MIL we're leaving (glorious CBF ensues). 

Next day, I leave to meet a friend in that city for a few hours while DH stays with his parents. In this time, MIL started telling him a ""funny story"" about how one of the biddies is looking for a suitor for her daughter. In MILs culture, parents playing matchmaker is still a thing. MIL and FIL met in school by the way, with no parental interference and she prides herself on being a ""modern lady"". MIL starts telling DH all about the daughter, she's very pretty, working on her masters, understands their culture and .... She told her mom she had a crush on DH. MIL laughs, DH laughs and says that's weird but okay thinking that was it. It wasn't ! The ""funny story"" turns into MIL telling DH that her and biddie were talking about how they wish they could match DH with the daughter and how perfect it would be. Don't you think it would have been perfect DH ??? At this point, DH gets pissed and says I already have a perfect wife and this is weird and walks away. I get home a few hours later and have no idea about this when MIL starts chatting and also tells me the ""funny story"" but more in a ""isn't it so funny this girl has a crush on DH"". We're very secure with each other, so I really didn't think anything of it other than my MIL being her weird self and humored her by saying something about DH being a catch. 

Now that I'm processing this, I realize, it's kinda fucked up no?? Before we met, MIL and FIL tried for years to pressure DH into an arranged marriage because they were afraid he'd end up marrying outside their culture and that was MILs biggest nightmare (haha). DH ended up going NC for almost a year after they accused him of being a horrible son for not wanting to marry a stranger just to appease his parents. 

Its super insulting what MIL said though - hes a married man and she's inviting him to chat about how perfect it would have been to be with someone else instead??? We have a business we've built from the ground up together, a home, a happy life, but none of it matters because he's not with someone she approved of from her culture. Funny enough, DH and I got engaged after 6 months of dating after I hadn't even met his parents yet since they're far. He doesn't care about her approval obviously. 

We only see MIL twice a year for a couple of days and I'm already VLC and DH is LC so I'm not bothered. But thanks MIL for continuously validating my decision to not have a relationship with you :)

"My stepdaughters fist dance is coming up!! Of course that means fights between parents  and kids of dresses and what's appropriate if you have a teenager you know what I'm talking about...I have two...(yes I'm going gray) the worst fight was with my SD biomom..she had arranged and was trying to force my daughter to go on a date with a boy - no way in f@#$$&gt;; hell ! She will never be pressured to do anything like that, not with anyone, not by anyone. In the end, we won and she is going with my recommendation and going with a group of her girl friends. SD is just in her words not ready to date and was having a panic attack about it. Now she is happy to hang out and be a pretty young lady with her friends.
 
This reminds me of FFF. 

IF you have read the past post you can tell what a lovely and attentive mother figure she was....just a peach...- ok so you know she was anything but.

When it came time to my high school dances I at 16, was well fully grown. I used to play sports and do martial arts so I was in great shape.  Never once had my mother ever taken me shopping, gotten my hair and nails done..make up...nothing. (this is relevant)

So one day when I come home in between school and work she walks up all nice and says oh we need to go shopping and have a girls day...all sweet - it was worse then a horror movie I knew something was up.

I asked why? You never want to do that plus I have work and a softball game later.  She tells me we have guest and wants me to look my best. 

Remember my fellow redditors, I said my stepasswhole was a different ethnicity ... mother fell into his brain washing /mind numbing bullshit. 

I tell her no thank I have to work and my team needs me (hello short stop and power hitter plus I was trying for a scholarship) 

I go towards the door and out walks the step jerk and I swear a flock..that's what it looked like of the same ethnicity. (Which I have no problem with that's why I am keeping this as vague as possible) 

I'm stuck as I cant get in the door but this Male in his 30's walks around me like I'm some kind of....well like you were inspecting a show horse for sale. I don't like it, I dont like him either he just give me the creeps. 

Then he looks me in the eyes, sees my Irish furry as he won't let me get by and states.
""So much spirit, it will be fun to break her""

It clicks in my head...they were trying to marry me off...fuck this..I'm American, in America..and I'm irish.

I spit right in his face and then punch him and knock him out. (Spitting is a severe form of disrespect) and I tell them in their language that my body is not for sale and Irish will never break...we destroy those who dare try to break us.

I stepped over his body as he's coming around grab my work stuff and game stuff and run to work. 

I swore that day no child of mine would ever be forced to do anything she/he  didn't want especially dating.

I heard the screaming for days...they had already received money..but they couldn't force me..and since I had made such a show now their name was mud...no one would accept me...or my sisters...or even his own daughter I had ruined the family..

I took the punishment, the attempted beatings and they realized they couldn't hurt me anymore physically the did the one thing to make me run away which I will post later.

So I look at my SD smiling and think of what FFF tried to do...and how she will never ruin these moments for my family.",JUSTNOMIL
"We had the meeting with our lawyer at 915 this morning and we pled our case. He told us that it’s obvious something is wrong and that he would love to have our case but since no charges had been brought against us he couldn’t go with us to the meeting. We talked about the stuff that was brought up here, he didn’t say much about any of it but said that our case was winnable. And it’s $2500 to retain him.  Of course.

Also, once we got there, the facilitator said that if we decided to bring in a lawyer they had to end the meeting and file charges. 

On with the CPS meeting:
Everyone introduced themselves, there was the CPS caseworker and her Supervisor, the facilitator, a peer mentor and caseworker from some kind of drug and alcohol assessment/ treatment place.
They start out by talking about everything I had put in the previous post and that the only way we could plan on getting our kids back was to agree to start this alcohol/drug assessment and it would most likely be 90 days before they would even have another meeting so the kids could come back. 
I threw up. 
The kids have to stay with TCE and FIL at least for now. Their home was fast track approved. (But I mean, why wouldn’t it? It’s 3500 square foot mansion with bedroom/bathroom suites.)

But now I’m having to completes program too. Is this normal? None of this sounds normal to me. If we don’t comply I’m guessing formal charges will be brought? No one has said anything.  Should we do this? Should we do the programs? Should we get the lawyer? I just have no idea what to do. 

The truth is that I have NEVER done any kind of hard drug in my life and especially cocaine. I’ve smoked out here and there, but who hasn’t? Yes, my husband has been to rehab for something completely unrelated, but he passed with flying colors and has been going to NA and doing what he should. The allegations of him driving around with the kids and doing drugs is completely false. I have done everything in my power to protect them from what was going on with my husband during all of his struggles. We may not have been The Cleavers before this but we were happy.",JUSTNOMIL
"On my phone. Sorry for formatting.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly my MIL (my partner and I aren't married/engaged) isn't bad. I do like her. I don't know that this is the right sub to post in because she isn't a JN in any other situations and not sure that the below qualifies her to be one in these situations.

&amp;#x200B;

BUT since we've had our daughter (almost 3mo) little things are starting to bug me.

&amp;#x200B;

* She automatically assumes every single time that DD is hungry that we're giving her a bottle (we had issues in the beginning with weight and latching and my supply, so in the hospital they said we needed to top up with formula after each feed but that's not the case anymore and she's mostly breastfed now) and asks if we have one ready and where it is. The answer is no (because she would normally just go on my boob) and we get called silly or some comment is made about how we don't have one ready and she'll just go off and make one.. I'm not super comfortable with breastfeeding in front of others so normally let it slide and just pump once she leaves.

&amp;#x200B;

* She smokes. My partner and I don't. Normally when she's over it's not for that long, so to me, it's a matter of just go with smoking for an hour or two. Shouldn't be that hard? Apparently, no. So she'll go outside and have a smoke and come back inside and I hate it for DD, if it was just adults around and no baby I wouldn't care. (My partner and I have spoken about this and we are going to say from now on no one can smoke at our house - my dad also smokes).

&amp;#x200B;

And the one that annoys me the most...

* If DD is asleep when she arrives she'll poke and prod her saying something to the effect of ""common, wake up, I want cuddles"". This drives me mad. Especially at the moment when we aren't having many or long day time naps (sleeping like a champ at night though). Like seriously let her sleep! Why on earth wake her up?? She is the first grandchild so I get that she's excited and all those things but yeah still makes me go crazy on the inside.

"So it's been awhile since I last wrote about my MIL. She's the one who is obsessed with Starbucks coffee and showed up late to get her hair and makeup for my wedding because she NEEDED her daily Starbucks. She also really likes leggings, ugg boots, and pumpkin spice so DH and I joke that's she an older version of a basic bitch. I call her Starbucks Bitch. 

So things had been pretty quiet for several months. A few BEC moments, but I hadn't seen her since October so most of it wasn't that bad. She declared herself cancer free in December (her doctor declared her cancer free in like August but whatever), but as someone here told me, she now likes to insert cancer survivor as her excuse for everything. *Sigh* She sent me a novelty sweatshirt for Christmas because it was cheap - so even though DH told her before she bought it that I wouldn't wear it, she thought it would be rude of me not to wear it. It's since been donated. She also expressed her sympathy of a death in my family by telling DH to say sorry to me, and bragging to her daughters about how she sent flowers for the funeral. She didn't and she didn't think they would mention this to their brother. When I posted the obituary online she thanked me and said it was a shame they'd never get to meet. Not “sorry for your loss”. 

And then came the visit. Starbucks bitch and crew (FIL, SIL1, SIL2, and GC niece) all came for a visit last month. It was planned, and I dreaded it. DH and I talked about how to handle his mother - mainly that he would keep her away from me so I didn't have to deal with her crap. But he didn't really do a good job. The theme of this visit seemed to be that if PurpleCat said more than 3 sentences MIL and her entire family would die. Or at least that seems to be the game MIL was playing.  Someone asks me a direct question, Starbucks Bitch answers. One of these questions was literally about how my family is doing. She answered even though the last time she spoke to my mom was last year.  When I corrected her she giggled and told me that didn't sound right. Like how would you know???? 

She also corrected everything I said. Here is a list of things I apparently got wrong:

* There is no such thing as a home warranty. It's called insurance and you have to pay double the value of a new appliance for them to fix the old one.
* I got the alcohol laws of my state wrong. Walmart does sell hard liquor and liquor stores are open on Sundays. It was just a coincidence that the closest Walmart and liquor stores weren't open/didn't have liquor there. 
* The school I work for doesn't teach kids past 8th grade. I thought we taught up to 12th grade since I have to work 12th grade graduation but I'm wrong. 
* I forgot that I should always let MIL know I have my ID on me. It was really embarrassing for her when someone I asked if I could drive home and she told them I couldn't due to lack of my ID when I corrected her. Having to announce to your MIL that you are in possession of a driver's license any time she sees you is completely normal. 
* I didn't want veggie stir fry at the restaurant. I was clearly confused and needed the menu read to me. 
* I'm a vegetarian so I only eat tofu. If there isn't tofu I won't eat at that restaurant. Even if I say I will. Even if I suggested the restaurant.
* I'm not a vegetarian and I love chicken. 
* I didn't specify how large the margaritas were at the restaurant, and by failing to do so I misled the entire family. I was also wrong to apologize for not specifying how big the margaritas were. MIL was not trying to shame me, but was only mentioning that she only approved this restaurant because I said they had margaritas. And if I told her the truth she wouldn't have picked that restaurant. 
* I was wrong when I said I was in severe pain at the restaurant. So it was okay for her to order dessert and another glass of wine. (Later realized I had a stress related anxiety attack- never had one before but as soon as I was away from her everything was fine) 

These are just the things she said and did in front of me. Behind my back she asked DH if I rushed him to buy a house (sidenote - we bought our first house!). She knows he wants to move closer to her (no he doesn't) so she knows I must have rushed him. When he said no we BOTH wanted to buy a house she told him he must be confused and explained how much harder it would be to move home now. Once I was gone his entire family also told him they would support him if they needed to tell me DH wasn’t comfortable buying a house - that felt GREAT. We aren't moving because we make good money here. I also can't stand the weather in his home state. I think she’s actually angry because us buying a house means she can’t pretend DH’s goal is to move back home, and because he never asked for her help/opinion about it. She brags to her friends and family that her children always consult her about big decisions so it was really embarrassing that DH didn’t ask mommy’s opinion before making this purchase. 

On the last day DH finally confronted her when they were alone. He basically said the ball is in her court when it comes to our relationship. He told her she needed to stop treating me like a child who doesn't know anything. I noticed she did similar things to her daughters, especially SIL2, and DH tried to rug sweep (that's just how she is). After talking he realized while his sisters love his mom because she raised them and all, I have no reason to put up with her if she can't be normal. So he added that too. He mentioned that I'm a shy person, so just because I didn't publicly call her out on her shit doesn't mean I'm okay with her behavior. 

Her response? She laughed at him and told him I'm not shy. That was it. DH was pissed she accused him of not knowing his own wife. Cue the tears and shouting “That's not what I meant!"" and “It must just be my cancer brain!” But after all that the only thing she addresses is the comment about me being shy? Nothing about me not liking her or us having a less than ideal relationship? Apparently she treats me the way her own JustNoMIL treated her. And she brags how she's nothing like that woman and how close we are. 

At this point I'm just done with her. I told DH I will continue to be civil, but we need to keep visits to a minimum. She can never stay overnight in our home, she will never be alone with any children we have (if she's comfortable telling me I'm wrong about my own job she's definitely okay with deciding I'm wrong with how I'll parent and do whatever she wants), and all contact between us will go through him (this won't be a problem when it comes to her talking to me since she already does this, but she expects me to post publicly for her special days so she can show off how much I love her). DH agreed but he still has a problem admitting I don't like her. He still thinks we can have a relationship even though I told him I don't really want one with her at this point, but she still needs to treat me with basic respect.

Well I don't have to see her until Christmas now, so I expect silence until then. Maybe a few more BEC moments when she talks to DH on the phone, but I'm very glad I live several states away and only have to put with this woman 2 times a year, soon to be just once a year. :)",JUSTNOMIL
"Sorry, but this is going to be a very, very disappointing update.

No one's more disappointed than I am. 

Some good news is that we found a truck! It was exactly what DH wanted and not to pat myself on the back, but I mopped the floor with the car salesmen. I used my finance background to my advantage and got a pretty good deal. I'm kind of proud of myself.. this whole situation has made me a hardass. 

DH's shiny spine has withered. He unblocked his parents numbers and has added them back on social media. I never removed them from mine, so I made a post about how DH and I are strong together and how the universe can't stop what it can't catch and included a picture of us from years ago.. his family didn't acknowledge the post, but I'm sure they've seen it. I got around 100 likes so since it was popular, probably went to the top of their newsfeed. FIL has messaged DH and me, texted, called, etc. He acts remorseful. He acknowledges me at work and has been asking about our new truck and wants to come over to see it. MIL still acts like she was entitled to the truck and they didn't do anything wrong. DH hasn't spoken to her very much. He did post about his new truck when he got it. She didn't like the post, but she sent him a text saying ""what, no pictures of your truck before you put it on Facebook?"" To which he replied ""No."" Ha.

I think I need to give DH a little grace.. I'm very disappointed and angry, but these aren't my parents. It's easy for me to cut them off because they didn't raise me. When you're raised by a narc, I guess it's hard to cut them off? I wouldn't know personally, but DH seems to be struggling A LOT with guilt. The guilt has been eating him alive and he seems angry at me for not letting them get away with it. I guess being angry at me is easier than being angry at MIL. He's having a hard time keeping an appetite and tries to justify what they did. But there's no way around it, they betrayed him. He acknowledges their messed up priorities and how she's just not a nice person and she cheated him out of his truck. I'm trying to remind him that his adverse feelings to what they did are normal and appropriate to the situation and not to fight it, just be with it. We've started therapy individually and together. It's still new and DH is having a hard time opening up, but I think he'll get there.

As for SIL's car, I have no real update. We've made about 5 months worth of ""ghost payments"" without telling FIL so we're ahead on the car payments. That way, if he misses one, it's not going to hurt us. No advice is wanted on this specifically, DH isn't going to take SIL's car, even though I know it's fair. I don't really want to take it now either.

Pregnancy is going well despite all this. We'll find out the gender in a couple weeks and I have a gut feeling it's a girl. I love being pregnant and I'm starting to feel little flutters here and there that could be baby kicks, but they could also be gas lol. This situation has opened DH's eyes enough to where he doesn't want LO around his parents with the exception of some holidays. They aren't trustworthy and he doesn't want to expose LO to their selfishness. Despite all that's happening, this is a very happy pregnancy. We're focusing on the good and counting our blessings.",JUSTNOMIL
"I emailed my mom last week [after my NC boundary letter] telling her I had received her reply [her reply was very apologetic and took responsibility for how she hurt me] and I said I would contact her when I was ready. She then told me ""okay in the meantime I will not contact you""

Well today I wake up to this email:

""Please let me know if your therapist thinks it would be beneficial to Skype me in!

"I don’t know if any on you remember but I nuked my old account. I wrote about how DH(boyfriend at the time) car broke down. Well he got it towed for a free diagnosis and that was that, he wanted to tow it back no fixing he just wanted to know what went wrong and move on. Well no, his mom decided that they were going to get it fixed. To quote her in text she said “it’s okay don’t worry dad wants to take care of it.” DH said “seriously don’t I don’t want to pay you guys back don’t fix it” she went on to do it anyways. 

Well here is what me and DH knew. We knew she went to the mechanic shop, pulled out a credit card on her name, then she didn’t want to pay it anymore after 2 or 3 months and so she made DH go to the bank with her(not In a rude way just like a “hey we’re going to the bank so it can be under your name” I went too.”  and they pulled out a loan in his name with her co-signing it. 6 months later we took her off of the loan. 

Now here we are, we have $23 left on the loan with just DH on it because we have been making $400 payments on it monthly. Well i called the mechanics shop because I wanted to surprise DH and get him a “hybrid” motor basically 2 types merged into one and I was calling for them to quote me a rebuilding the “2 types” we talked about financing and since this car is very old and there is basically only one of our where we live they remembered and so then I said would he be able to finance it and he said he wasn’t sure because HIS MOM CO-SIGNED FOR HIM FOR THAT LOAN. 

This threw me off. First of all she said her and his dad would take care of it then they throw the payments at him when they knew this wasn’t what they said they would do and now almost a year later we find out she pulled out a credit card on his name to get that loan in the first place?? WTF.

Now DH has many credit cards with her as an authorized user now before I didn’t think she would use them but now I have no doubt. My question is how do I get her off all the accounts that she is an authorized user in? Most importantly who do we go to that can check his credit and say “you can close this one and this one and they won’t affect you” because I want to get rid of her name on things. 

Also the 1 year free credit report how do we know if someone has taken it out and looked at his credit report already? Does it say any info on them? Or would it just make you pay for it? We plan to check it in August that’s a full year where she would have had no absolute reason to check his credit because me and him were moved in. Please just drench me in credit info and what I can do to the mechanics shop(it’s a professional one not a backroad mechanics shop) for letting someone commit fraud? Did she even commit fraud with the mechanics shop? I’m so lost please help.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hey all! I thought life was going swell after being NC with CV, also known as my FMIL. It’s been almost 2 months since I’ve stepped foot in FDH’s family’s home, but now the wife of my future BIL, henceforth known as SIL, has run into issues with CV. I’ll try to keep this as short as possible, but let me tell you, shit has well and truly hit the fan. 


It started on Friday when CV went to SIL’s house to give money to her grandkids. The kids have been raised to not accept sums of money like that from people, so they nicely said no thank you to her. CV goes on about how they never accept anything from her and called SIL disrespectful, with SIL replying “what, like all your other DILs?” This pissed off CV who told her to “Stay away from (HisNameIsRusty)”, and started calling her a bitch, all in front of her grandkids and the neighbours. SIL told her to never come to her house again. 


Messages were sent, things were awful, CV called BIL to try to get him to side with her (because he was at work at the time), but then sent her the shittiest apology I have ever seen after that call. The apology was along the lines of “I spoke to (BIL), I’m sorry, I think you’re right, I’m just old school”.  Because SIL told me what was going on, I told FDH who then decided to call CV to ask for her side. She told him, he told her he couldn’t defend her actions and that it’s her problem, and then she loses her shit about how FDH always defends me but never CV. She also said she’s not coming to our engagement party. 


On Sunday, she decided she wants to come to the engagement party now (I wanna hold her to her original words but people are saying we should still send her an invitation). Sunday night, she sent SIL more messages which is full of lies. One of the funniest parts was her saying “My sons don’t approve of what you’re doing, they don’t want to see you or spend time with the kids, they think you’re selfish”, ALL WHILE THE BROTHERS WERE AT SIL’S HOUSE! CV clearly had no idea they were there, too funny. But she also told SIL that she’s now disowning her grandchildren, and telling SIL how selfish and rude and disrespectful she is, and she will never see them again. 


SIL showed me these messages yesterday (Monday), but things got worse when SIL asked CV to take down her FB profile pic and cover photo that has the kids in it, since she now disowns them. In retaliation, CV changed her profile pic from just her youngest granddaughter to a pic of her with all the kids. SIL lost her mind (understandably so), and then posted the screenshots of what CV sent her, exposing her for the world to see who CV truly is. I like to stir the pot so I liked the post, and CV called FDH so he could convince his brother to get SIL to take down the post, and that she apparently regrets saying those things (nah man, you just hate being exposed for people to see the horrible person you are). She also told him to tell me to unlike it or she will never see me again, but I don’t think she realises how much joy that would bring me. SIL eventually took the post down because of all the outrage that started up. 


This morning, I got a series of messages from CV. I should have blocked her, but dad had convinced me to take the high road and not block her. She pretty much said that SIL is full of lies, she’s disrespectful, told me to stay away from her, all that jazz. Those messages are the ones that are full of lies, and I’ve for a photo album on my phone with all the evidence of the shit she pulls. So I don’t believe her, especially since she has said similar things to me in the past and I’ve got screenshots to prove it. 


I haven’t responded, but God I want to. All these receipts I have that call her out and prove SIL is the truthful one, but that’s just going to make things worse. I honestly don’t know what to do. Should I tell SIL what CV sent me this morning? She tells FDH that it’s none of my business, but she’s the one dragging me into it. I’m sick of her lies, guilt trips and manipulation. She said she’ll get grandkids out of FDH and I, but I told FDH that she won’t get any grandkids out of us. We will have our children some day, but she will not be their grandmother, and I don’t want her in their life. 


Gees, what do I do now? FDH is stuck in the middle of all of this, and I’m worried he’ll get kicked out of home with nowhere to go. What boundaries do we start setting now? What can we do for SIL and the family? Thank you all, love you and appreciate the advice ❤️",JUSTNOMIL
"Im so confused. My SO has a relative (outside of the nuclear family) that he’s not particularly close to, and that person’s spouse recently died.  

SO’s family is full of histrionic women who have a healthy habit of spreading misinformation. 

What I’ve been told is that the deceased was addicted to drugs, physically abusive, and came from a dysfunctional family that enabled these problems. 

JNMIL has no relationship with the dead person’s family (she barely even knows the dead person). But if I had to guess, the stories I’ve heard about the drugs and violence are probably rooted in some truth. 

Here’s what I do know is true:
-when the person was found dead, JNMIL and the living spouse responded by doing shots
-the living spouse’s parents hate the dead person’s guts
-everyone in SO’s fam hates the dead person’s surviving family members. 

This is a lot of information I shouldn’t even know in the first place, since I don’t have a relationship with any of these GD people. 

With all of that said, JNMIL asked if I would take my toddler over to the dead person’s parents house and spend a few hours with them (hours?) to pay my respects. 

What? I have never met these people in my life. The only relationship I have to the deceased is 1. when he/she oddly followed and then unfollowed me on social three years ago even though I had never met him/her. 2. Attending the same group dinner one time. 

And if this person physically attacked JN’s relative, why is she asking this of me? And where does JN get off inviting people on behalf of the dead person’s family? I believe she has only met them once in her life and she clearly loves talking about how awful they are. 

I told her no way and she quickly/defensively said “fine fine I get it sure ok I understand.” But her husband (SO’s dad) said in a separate convo that the family is judging certain people who don’t attend. 

Am I unaware of unspoken rules in regard to death and etiquette? If I am obligated to hang out in the dead’s childhood home, then why the hell don’t I just wear black and whip up casseroles every day? Then I can follow complete strangers home from funeral processions and crash their events too. 

Can she really not tone down her usual batshit need to impose her will even while people are grieving?",JUSTNOMIL
"OS is 11 and DH is not his father, but we've been together since he was 4. DH and OS are super close, and OS was even treated like a grandchild by mil. LO is over a year old.  Once LO was born everyone went nuts over the baby. OS was just pushed to the background. 

DH and bil had spoken with mil previously. Most changed so DH and I had a sit down w mil about it.  We were extra kind the whole point was to have her give OS the same amount of attention. 

Of course during the convo she took no responsibility, blamed OS, blamed me, cried, etc.... that was ignored on our end and I thought we had a resolution. 

Now her attitude is "" I'm sorry OS isn't comfortable in my home,  and I hope you will allow me whatever relationship you see fit.""

Also....OS had an award ceremony &amp; Elementary graduation. Mil was invited and given the info and never showed. I cant even reply to that comment. Other than I am not taking either child to her home for anything.",JUSTNOMIL
"Sorry I'm doing anything wrong, I'm hoping it fits this sub. 

Here's the back story. My mother emotionally abused me (19) until I was 15. I finally broke down and texted her that I wasn't going to see her again and went full NC with her for over a year. (My parents separated when I was 12 and she lives 4+ hours away). This will be important later on. I don't want to go in-depth about what I had to go through, but I just recently went to therapy and got ask by multiple doctors how I was able to survive this. I honestly don't know. 

I developed serious mental issues, including severe depression, PTSD, social anxiety and an eating disorder since I was very young.

I have a brother (29) who I'm not close with. We don't fight and we love each other dearly, but he's not into ""big feelings"", meaning he doesn't express his love strongly. But we are and always were on good terms.  I think it's also because he's almost 10 years older than me.

He became father recently (my little nephew is 6 months old). He's living with his gf and his son.

Now on to the story. My mother sent me pictures of my brother, his son, his gf and herself at the beach yesterday saying that she think it's unfortunate that I ""don't want to be there"". Which is not entirely true, since I need to attend my classes at the university here and I don't have the money to go (but I'm also massively afraid of seeing her again).

I was fuming. I was so angry because I feel like my mother is getting away with what she has done. I'm an outcast in my family cause I openly display ""weakness"" (aka not _completely_ rug-sweeping mental health). I think a lot about telling my brother. 

I want him to support me. I mostly want to explain what happened. He moved out when I was 8 and before he was absent a lot. He never really recognized anything. And that's okay. I don't blame him in any way! I just want him to understand. And I want to protect my little nephew, I'm scared that she might pull the same bs with him. (I'm not gonna let that happen though, I'm gonna be there for him.)

I not sure for several good reasons that my mother changed, one of them being that _I_ took the initiative to stop her behaviour by going NC, as I said above. She hasn't seen a mental health professional whatsoever. 

But I feel like he wouldn't understand. He probably wouldn't believe me or play it down since that's just how he is. I guess he thinks we just had some fights and I don't know how my mother presented (maybe manipulated?) the situation.

I don't want to force him to decide between my mother and I and I don't want this to be decided at my nephew's expense. It would hurt so bad to know that _I_ took this opportunity from him to have a normal, healthy family. 

What should I do?

"Possible trigger: food and diet issues, childhood dieting

*Edit to add: please please please do not offer me advice about what diet I should consider trying.*

I just realized something this morning. For a little back story, my mom, Eggshelly, used to put the whole family on whatever fad diet she was on. I struggled with my weight pretty much always. (Though, I don't think my sister fully participated in the diets cause she was always skinny) Anyway, I now have a really hard time with food because I grew up in a constant diet and fail cycle. 

I just had a thought that the reason Eggshelly got so mad when I told her I didn't want to talk about my recent food issues, is because I think she saw all those diets we went on together as mother-daughter bonding. 

Well, in my journey to be healthier, I've decided not to talk about particulars of what I decide to eat, with anyone, because it's so painful when people know you're on a diet, and then ask you about it and the failure part of the cycle is fully on display. 

Anyway, I've been thinking more and more about my childhood, and things Eggs did that may not have been the greatest. I do kinda feel like I'm being unfair to her, or blaming her for a lot of things, because I am currently mad at her. But sometimes it helps to feel like my food issues aren't totally my fault. That might be kinda messed up. 

I do know that she was always critical about my appearance. Especially in highschool when I went through my ""black hoody and black skirt everyday"" phase. I can't fully remember specifics, I just know that I had weird style sense and she would always point out when she thought my choices for the day were weird. When I started wearing colors again, she was ""so glad I am done with that phase."" 

I'm realizing too that going clothes shopping with her, she would always convince me to buy clothes that I wasn't that into by telling me how good it looked. I would believe her and then end up never really wearing the thing cause I didn't feel right in it. 

I don't know. I might be overblowing perfectly innocent things from my past. No mom is perfect. I do now set boundaries regarding my appearance- I will straight up tell people that I'd rather not discuss it if they ask about my diet. And I have gotten pretty good at gray-rocking comments about my weight. (You know, that oh so common, ""you look great, have you lost weight?"") I actually get less of those comments from my mom now because I just kept replying with, ""actually, no. I haven't"" which is hard to respond to. Haha. 

Anyway, I do know that I'm an adult now and thus responsible for my own food issues, but it does feel a little bit good to shake my fist at Eggs when I fail to make healthier choices. Maybe that's not fair or healthy. I might need to bring this up at therapy, haha.",JUSTNOMIL
"I called SO the other day when he was visiting Cebolla the Onion MIL, who is supposedly doing much better now that her son is always visiting.  I was on speaker and after I'd asked what I called to ask, I said, ""Okay, well. Love you, SO, FIL, and Cebolla. Bye.""

""Well, Incarnata,"" Cebolla interjected. ""I just have one thing to say. You might love him but I've loved him longer than you have.""

Despite wanting to reply with something smart, I simply said, ""Huh. Funny, that.""",JUSTNOMIL
"So, for the first year or so of dating my husband, his friends would laugh and warn me about his mother. I genuinely liked her and didn’t see the problem... even the things they suggested seemed like no biggie. I always countered with, “well, okay, but she MEANS well.” I always felt a little sad and hoped I’d never see the version of her that they did. 

I still think she means well. But oh god. I see her in a different way now. 

She lies about stupid shit. SS is going to camp, and we didn’t tell him about it yet. She knows he’s not supposed to know... and she told him about it. She TOLD me she told him about it, and I asked her why she would do that, as I had specifically told her he wasn’t supposed to know. She played it off like he already knew, but he did not.

This weekend at a party, she retold the story in front of me and changed the ending. “I told him, “I don’t know, you’ll have to ask Starfishingit and Dad”.” She said. 

“Um. Except you DID tell him he was going to camp.” I said. 

Another big thing that burns me sounds stupid, so bear with me... but it’s junk food. MIL brings him donuts 2-3 times a week. She’d bring them more often, but I put up a stink, so I was finally able to AT LEAST convince her to only bring him donuts on days where he doesn’t have other treats at school/home. She agreed... and sneaks him donuts anyway. 

Last week he had three donuts and ice cream three times. One day he had donuts and ice cream TWICE.

He’s a skinny kid, so she doesn’t see the harm in it. The harm in it is that he used to enjoy fruit and vegetables, and now he’s losing his taste for anything that isn’t deep fried and covered in sugar. My husband eats like shit because his parents never instilled good habits in him, and I want better for SS.

And also... I mean it’s the goddamn principle of the thing. If we tell you not to give him donuts all the time, STOP. Because we told you to. Instead she sneaks them and lies about it.

And now I’m pregnant. She’s retired and my husband and I both work full time, and she keeps telling me “childcare is free!” 


I......... don’t want my child with her. 

If I can’t trust her not to give SS a donut, I can’t trust her to not give my baby solid food without my permission, or feed her ice cream when I’m not looking.

I don’t know what to do here. We’ve attempted to talk to her in the past, and she literally tells me “oh I know, I don’t like [SS] to have a lot of sugar, either.” And then she turns around and gives him the sugar. I don’t know if she’s stupid or just a passive aggressive bitch.

And I know it’s “just sugar” but really, to me it comes down to trust and respecting our wishes. 

If I DON’T let her watch my child, I’m not really sure what else I can do. I’m in no position to quit my job, and I don’t think I can afford daycare at this point. I feel very stuck.

"It has been sometime since I have updated. Life after nc was much better on my mental health. No more worrying how mil, bil or in laws (basically) will react when I go over. 

Dh goes over lesser now for dinner because we are busy. He is busy with work. I am busy with work. Ds has been refusing naps. Hence his bedtime has been switched till an earlier time, 6.30pm~7pm. 

Of course not being able to see ds, mil asked dh if we were deliberately keeping him from them. 
I guess in a way especially after the drunken bil incident. I am supposed to be on nc for 3 months and slowly increasing contact while observing if bil does it again. I did not stopped dh from contacting them, but he has been busy. 

I have in a way dropped the rope that I would not bring ds over to their house for dinner by myself as I do not want to face drunken bil by myself. 
Also, ds was skipping naps. When children (young children) skip naps, they are a horrible mess, prone to meltdowns and irrational behaviors (like I dropped my blanket, but I am upset that I dropped my blanket). I am not going to bring a cranky sleep deprived kid over to their place!

"DH and I have been married about a year, Together about 5. MIL and I have mostly been cordial, and I really think she means well. BUT, we don't hang out (even though she would like that) and it's always been evident that she does not like giving up control. 

BACKGROUND: For example, MIL and FIL offered to help pay for our wedding. Money was put into an acct husband and MIL both had access to for this reason. We withdrew some planning to pay a bill r/t the wedding. She immediately called wanting to know where it went and what it was for. Issa big red flag. Grateful for their help, but also why give it if you need an itemized receipt?

When DH and I moved in together, we would visit about every other week because they were newly empty nesters. He was had just finished his masters, completing hours for his licensure,  and had already left a job for another. Every visit, his job stability would come up. Or MIL saying 'oh I know about a job here, and you could do that part time's or 'I know this person who could mentor you'. It seemed helpful at first, but DH had worked all that out on his own and it under control.

NOW: More recently, his current company has faced difficulty and almost closed. He doesn't share all the details, but he's honest if she keeps prying. At our mothers day dinner, with MY MOTHER and his parents, she started in on the same track. ""How's your job"" and ""sounds like you need to find something else"" and ""well what are you going to do"" and other little critiques. I always try to change the subject bc it is uncomfortable for us both. 

This past weekend, in front of extended family we haven't seen in forever, her ""hows your job"" talk turned into ""better get your resume ready, probably going to be out of a job soon"". I felt like she was making it seem like he can't keep a job, which is inaccurate. He's one of the best at his job. I feel like its inappropriate to discuss, especially in front of others, when we HAVE NOT asked for advice. We've talked about his job and job stability in private, as a couple. When I ask DH about it, he says ""that's just how she is"". But this and other jabs at our financial status happen literally every time we see them.

"Hi r/JUSTNOMIL! I'm new here, but I have a FMIL who drives me up a wall. I was wondering if you could tell me if I'm overreacting, and maybe give some advice?

So to kick right off, I had my first baby girl with my boyfriend 2 months ago. FMIL has been all over her ever since, but it bothers me so much. Back when we announced the pregnancy, she flew into a total rage. Crying, begging us to reconsider, etc. It was a great night, ugh. She told my bf to either talk me into an abortion or dump me. This was when I was 3 months pregnant and after we had showed her ultrasound pictures! We were happy and excited, but she made it about her. She did her damn best to make me feel like a filthy rat for ""trapping her son in an unwanted commitment."" 

Anyway, she ended up coming around, I guess. She threw a baby shower that was very obviously to impress her snobby friends and made racist remarks about my best friend and her mom (who I consider my mom as well). She also got mad that I wanted best friend and mama in the delivery room with me, and stormed out of the delivery room crying WHILE I WAS IN LABOR. The next few days consisted of the most unflattering pictures of me half naked holding a baby posted everywhere and more racist comments toward mama singing Spanish lullabies to my baby. 

We have a photo sharing app (Family Album for anyone interested) where family can send, share, and comment on the baby's pictures. FMIL has taken over and comments about 10 times a day on every single picture posted. Heaven forbid my bf's step mom comment. I got so ticked off seeing about a million heart eye emojis that I blocked all comments. 

I know it's unreasonable to be this angry over stupid emoji comments on an app, but am I wrong for holding this sort of grudge? She feels the need to upstage everyone in the grandma love department, but I can't help the feeling that she was the only person who didn't support the pregnancy. She literally didn't want this baby to exist. All the love feels so fake to me because I know this! My bf kinda brushes it aside when I bring it up because what can we do? I'm not normally an angry person or one to hold grudges, but this just bothers me every time I see her, hear her, or read her messages.

She doesn’t even pay attention to her. She watches tv or scrolls on the internet while my toddler rummages through cabinets and destroys the house.

"**TW: Mention of drug use, threats of suicide, racial and misogynistic slurs, possible domestic/general violence, mild mention of child abuse ahead**

Hello again.

I already said this before, but I’ll be damned if I don’t shout it from the rooftops: I fucking hate this woman. She’s a spineless, cowardly, enabling old cunt and ought to be ashamed of herself, especially after today’s events. This is gonna be a long one.

Before we get any further, let me express something: I know the lot of you will just tell me to ‘CALL THE COPS, CALL CPS, CALL SOMEBODY!!’. Trust me, I would in a second (and am planning on doing so as soon as I can). The problem is, my mother and I live with her at the moment, although we’ll hopefully have our own place by the end of July. And like I said, she’s a spineless, cowardly, enabling old cunt, and she’ll throw us to the streets if we jeopardize her precious GGS (GCGS?), even if the lowlife son of a whore deserves all of it and then some. So please, while I know you’re all full of good intent, just save it. However, if you wanna tell me how much of a ignorant twat my GM is, be my guest.

Also, I’ll probably end up X-posting to JUSTNOFAMILY, as this also has a lot to do with JNCousin. **TW: Mention of drug use, threats of suicide, racial and misogynistic slurs, possible domestic/general violence, mild mention of child abuse ahead.**

I’ve mentioned before that my GM is a huge enabler and a rugsweeper to my JNCousin. He’s a lowlife, no-good, manipulative abuser with a weakness for pot and cocaine. He considers the world his oyster and most women bitches that are good for nothing but cooking and cleaning. He’s a real delight./s

About once every few months, he and my GM’ll have some big blowout fight over something or another: his drug use (which she damn well knows about), how he treats his two year old daughter (poorly), that time he threatened to kill my mother in a fit of rage (which is a story for another day), et cetera, et cetera. They’ll scream at each other over the phone, call each other names, my GM will moan and groan about how she’s ‘done’ with him and never wants to see him again, yadda yadda. But by the time two weeks go by, it’s like it never happened. She’ll get his groceries, get food for his kid, whatever cleaning utensil he needs, and talk about how good he’s doing like he’s the eighth wonder of the world. It’s like the fact that he broke into their garage three years back, stole nearly 200,000 dollars from them, fled to Colorado to buy weed to sell back in home state (non-legal midwest) and went on the run for months never happened.

So today, GM left late this morning with the vacuum in tow, because god forbid he go out and buy one himself. Not that he could, because he still hasn’t paid his fines to get his license back, but y’know. She comes back about an hour later, and she had that look on her face that told me that the routine was starting up again.

Me: What happened now?

GM: (cousin’s name)...

Now, I couldn’t help but get excited here: I thought the prick got arrested (which he needs to be). But that’d just be too good to be true.

GM then told me the story, which went a little something like this: Apparently, she showed up to cousins’ house. JNC’s kiddo (let’s call her 2C for second cousin) grabs her by the hand and goes to lead her to the other room. JNC sees this and apparently yanks her away from JNGM and flies off the handle. Starts screaming at JNGM that he’s ‘babying’ 2C, ‘spoiling her’, how ‘you (GM) and (Baby Mama) spoil her and baby her’, starts yelling at a crying 2C to ‘stop crying, you’re not a baby’ and so on. 2C starts crying, obviously, and JNCousin won’t let GM comfort 2C. He thinks that showing basic human affection and general warmth to kids is ‘coddling’ and will ‘make them weak’. I call it ‘raising a future serial killer’.

JNC then went on to call GM names such as ‘n\*gger’ (note, we’re all white), ‘fucking bitch’, ‘fucking whore’, that ‘all you women are the same, bitches’, just losing his mind. She left sometime after that. She started crying at this point and going on and on about how he ‘treats that little girl like dirt’ (in other news, water is wet), how ‘she’s done with him’. She tells me that he told her he smokes pot ‘every day’, and that that’s probably what he was doing.

Now I’m no expert, so forgive me if I’m misinformed. But from what I understand, weed doesn’t make you fly into fits of rage at the drop of a hat. He’s done cocaine in the past. I spoke with another cousin recently (whose mom is also a struggling addict), and she agreed that he’s likely still on it. So I tell her that ‘no, weed makes you sluggish. Coke is what makes you go bonkers in fucking Yonkers’. Says nothing. She tells me that she’s ‘gonna do what she can to keep him away from her’.

Now, forgive me if I come across as callous in the next bit. It’s just that she’s been saying this shit for years and never sticks to her word, so I wasn’t falling for it just yet.

I tell her, “Okay, then call his probation officer or the police and tell them he’s doing drugs in front of his daughter.’. Does she do that? No. That’d be too easy. Instead, she calls his IDIOT baby mama, aka Rugsweeping Pro#2. She explains the situation, and BM just brushes it off as ‘he’s pissed off because he has no friends because he’s a jerk’. GM begs her to keep him away from 2C, she gives her the ol’ ‘well, he’s her dad’. They go back and forth, all the while I’m rolling my eyes so hard I was sure they’d fall out my damn head. They eventually come to the conclusion that the solution is...put 2C in daycare! BM works days now, so she’ll be away from him aside from the two days he gets her !!! :D:D:D. /s

At this point, I’ve had it. I tell her that BM won’t do diddly shit, daycare won't solve any problems, and that she needs to get on the phone with his probation officer- so she calls them up, he’s been off probation for months! Okay, cool, then you need to call the cops because GOD FORBID he goes off the fucking handle, and 2C gets hurt, or worse, 2C gets into whatever shit we all know he has in his house. She’s expressed that she fears for 2C’s safety when he’s using. You know what this bitch tells me?

“No, he’ll go to prison!!”

And I just have to stare at her. This fucker has, in no certain order:

* Broken a door and at least two windows in her house
* Threatened to kill himself if his kid gets taken away
* Shoved GM when she came to his house to find him using when his kid was due home at any time
* Threatened to kill GM, my mother, and Baby Mama
* Again, stole 200,000 dollars from GM and GP (although he’s served time for it, he got off easy because of fucking statue of limitations)
* Uses hard drugs in front of his kid

His ass isn’t going to rehab- the worst he’ll get is a 72-hour hold in the psych ward, after which he’ll be out and back to business because rugsweeping. So forgive me if I say that he should’ve been in prison long ago. But nooo, no prison for Golden Boy!

I tell her that calling the cops is her only option at this point, if she really wants to protect 2C. I remind her that one of these days, he’s inevitably going to lose it, and god forbid 2C gets caught in the fallout. She ignores me for a few minutes before she says something like, ‘There’s a lot more that goes into this that you don’t understand!!”

I cross my arms over my chest. “Alright, then enlighten me. What all goes into it?”. GM, of course, ignores me. I ask her, okay, what’s your plan then? She tells me, “I’m just gonna pray and think on this.’

At that point, I’m done. She’s proven once again that she’s all talk. She’d weeped on and on on the phone to BM about how she 'loves 2C more than anything in the world and would (supposedly) do anything for her'. Yet she won’t do what she has to do to keep her away from her no-good crackhead father. She’s already acting like nothing happened: she’s got Dr-Fucking-Phil on the TV. I tell her that if she doesn’t do something, 2C’ll suffer for it because she couldn’t be bothered to get someone involved.

Later on, I hear GM call JNC’s dad, who won’t do diddly shit, especially from Texas. I don’t hear the conversation ver batim, but from what I gather, he tells her pretty much the exact same thing. She then goes off on a tangent about how she’ll be taken away from both JNC and BM (who has a non-extraditable warrant for possession of meth in the neighboring state), and that she (GM) won’t be able to get to her, something about how the foster system is terrible, what I assume to be something derogatory about same-sex foster parents (all I heard was the word ‘gay’- see BB for her reaction to Mr. Ratburn’s wedding), just pissing and moaning and rallying a pity party at this point.

The story more or less ends here. Nothing came of it, and nothing will- at least, not from her. My mother is absolutely livid, and says that she’ll be calling the cops the second we get our own place. She said that ‘someone needs to go down there and kick that kid’s ass’. Frankly, I’m in agreement.

I’m drained, y’all. I worry so much about 2C that it’s just absurd- I also had an alcoholic father and a mentally unstable stepmother growing up, so I know exactly what she’ll be going through in a few years time- yet GM is more concerned with the fact that she’ll grow up and use ‘swear words’. Because while she can sit through Dr. Phil episodes talking about rape and incest and watch shoot-em-up movies, GOD FORBID they drop an f-bomb. I’m disgusted by her at this point- it’s clear that if he fucking kills someone (which is a distinct possibility, as he’s that much of a fucking loose cannon), she’ll help him hide the body. She’ll let her great-granddaughter grow up in an unstable, abusive, drug-filled household because she’s so codependent on him. She’s willing to forget the fact that he threatened to kill her only daughter and let us lay awake at night, terrified he’ll roll up in the middle of the night and shoot us all dead. I'm honestly terrified of him: he can flip like a motherfucking switch.

Fuck her. Fuck her and her ‘good Christian values’, her blatant stupidity, her enabling ways, her willingness to turn a blind eye. Just fuck her.

Again, advice is not applicable at the moment, especially if it’s just ‘call the cops’. Trust me, we will, just not now.

"Hi, I'm a long time reader first time poster (throwaway). I'm after some advice on whether my FMIL is showing signs of going full blown JustNo, if I'm maybe overreacting, and any advice on how to nip it in the bud and prevent any massive dramas in the future (e.g. the wedding).

TL;DR at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

Some background:

DFH and I have been together for almost 10 years. He's the 'golden boy' of the family: first one to finish college, good at sports, etc. Since we got together FMIL has always been outspoken about how much she loves me and how much of cute couple we are. A constant over-sharer, massive party animal, and borderline alcoholic, FMIL just doesn't seem to understand my reserved personality. We're pretty much the opposite in every way, she's an extrovert and I'm super shy, she's a big drinker and I hardly drink at all, she's a big one for hugging and I'm not, you get the picture.

Since we got engaged earlier this year I've been getting the feeling that it's all been an act on her part. There have been a few times when she's proven her complete lack or respect for me/us. For example: inviting a random dude to our (very intimate) housewarming without telling us. He showed up before her (!!!) and he didn't even know who DFH was when he answered the door. This was after we made it very clear to her that it was invite only.

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest problem happened when FMIL came to stay with us (we live interstate).

I have a few food allergies (not deadly, thankfully, but uncomfortable nonetheless) and DFH and I are also vegetarian so eating in our household is pretty tricky (and eating out is an absolute PITA). Thankfully we live in a fairly vege-friendly city and we have a few favourite restaurants that our visiting family and friends always enjoy. This usually isn't a problem as people understand how hard it can be to order food with allergies. Not FMIL.

After a few days of eating out, we were planning to cook at home for a few friends. FMIL offered to cook her family's favourite dish which contains meat and also some other ingredients I'm allergic to. I suggested we could change it to something else and I was told ""Not everything has to be stuff you can eat"". Ok, sure, she's right I don't need to be able to eat everything on the table but to be honest, even if it was a guest I would be catering to their dietary needs so they didn't feel left out. She then went on to say how accommodating she'd been the whole week by going to restaurants I could eat at (pubs?) and how her needs weren't being met (???). I was pretty confused because we hadn't even been going to vegetarian restaurants and she'd been ordering what she wanted the whole time.

I swallowed my anger and apologised that she didn't feel comfortable and asked her what we could do to fix it. Boy did I open a can of worms. Apparently the whole trip had been awful and I had been awful too. The rant basically boiled down to this:

* I was being selfish for only choosing restaurants I could safely eat at
* I was being judgemental to her drinking (untrue - I even had a couple of drinks with her so she didn't feel awkward)
* I'm just an all-round judgemental bitch but she's been trying really hard to ""accept our choices""
* I treat DFH terribly and I shouldn't speak to him the way I do (we had one(!) small disagreement over one thing with no raised voices or anything)
* I never take the time to get to know her

Both DFH and I were completely taken aback and shocked by this outburst. We'd both been trying our hardest to make her feel welcome so it was a complete shock. We tried to calmly explain ourselves but she called us liars and made everything about her. We ended up not resolving anything and all went to bed feeling shitty.

Skip to the next day and FMIL was acting all fine and happy and even asked me for a hug and if we ""were ok"" in front of our guests. I mean, I had to say yes of course to not cause a scene in front of everyone but how could she think it was all ok after her outburst the night before?

She left the next day and we didn't say anything more until DFH and I were talking about it and he mentioned how upset the whole thing had made him. We reached out to make our feelings known but were basically told that we were in the wrong again. DFH made the decision to leave the ball in her court and go NC until he got an apology.

A little over a month later DFH had gotten fed up with going NC and reached out again. They spoke on the phone and she again denied calling us liars and make a half-assed apology that she's sorry she made us upset (not for calling us liars, which she denied again). DFH said that he accepted this and told me that was the best I could hope to get and I should move on now. I'm not sure how I can move on when I know she still doesn't think she did anything wrong.

Am I overreacting?

Any advice on how I can ""move on""?

Any advice on how to approach her next time and avoid a repeat event?

Any advice on how to speak about it to DFH?

How can I politely tell her ""no"" when she won't stop pestering us about wedding details (""You \*have\* to have a live band"") even when we've already said ""no thank you""?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: FMIL visits, completely disrespects me, calls DFH and I liars, refuses to admit any fault, gives a weak apology and thinks its all sorted.",JUSTNOMIL
"So I flaired this No Advice Wanted because honestly I don’t think there’s anything I can do that would better this situation, but if you have something for me I’m all ears. 

Obligatory mobile warning. 

So D(ear)H and I finally hosted our housewarming parties the last two weekends. We have put so much work into this house in such a short amount of time all while juggling our now 9 month old DS. We are very proud of the end product and wanted to share that with our family and friends. And hey if people want to gift us a few things in exchange for us providing food, dancing, beer and just a fun evening then I’m not going to turn that away. 

DH and I had two separate housewarming parties at his suggestion. Now it’s worth noting here that I am religious and so are most of my friends and family. He and his family are not. This has never been a problem (as far as I knew up until tonight). DH being the considerate guy he is under that tough exterior suggested having a separate party for his family and coworkers so as not to make anyone uncomfortable. His mom and her side of the family as well as his coworkers have mouths that would honestly put a sailor to shame, we both knew that that would make my family extremely uncomfortable to be around. We wanted everyone to have a good time without worrying about having his family change the way they speak to each other and without sacrificing the comfort level of our guests. 

Apparently this was the worst idea in the world. My MIL found out about our second party with my family this afternoon and blew a fuse. Starting texting my husband repeatedly about how my in-laws must not be good enough for me or my friends and family and how we (everyone in my religion myself included) are hypocrites. Never mind the fact that I have gone out of my way multiple times both before and after my son was born to see all of my in-laws at least once a month. Or the fact that my husband and I had opened our home last weekend to everyone. I had to prepare food, rent tables, chairs, we bought games for everyone to play, provided alcohol and drinks for all of them. And in return we get a tantrum because we didn’t have one huge party (we wouldn’t have been able to fit 100+ people in our house anyway but whatever). 

Now mil is saying that she never wants to set foot in our home again so don’t expect her to and DH is saying that she’s probably going to cut all communication with our nuclear family for the next few months because of this. I felt like we were trying to be considerate of everyone’s feelings and lifestyles but she won’t even let my husband explain. DH was telling me that growing up this was a typical reaction of hers toward her own family. He told me there were multiple times that his aunt or grandmother would do something to upset his mom so she would just not speak to them at all for months on end. 

I’m kind of at a loss here. I’ve never had to deal with anything like this with my side of the family. My initial thought was to try to reach out to my FIL to explain and see if he could reason with MIL but I doubt DH would want me doing that. I’m feeling very hurt (to the point I broke down crying) by some of the things DH told me she has said about me since finding out I’m religious. I really just don’t know where to go from here. I don’t want there to be a rift between my DH and his family because of a misunderstanding. 

Sorry if this was a bit rambly I’m still pretty upset and just wanted to get this off my chest without burdening DH more than he already is.",JUSTNOMIL
"Obligatory first time poster long time lurker. This is going to be long. Tl;Dr on the bottom
Also English isn't my first language , sorry for any mistakes 

I never thought I would post here , because I have a really good relationship with my MIL. We treat each other like friends and she always says she is glad to have me in her life.

But it is obvious that she treats her children stricter and worse than me.
Her favorite child is my SO ,her first son, but because she subconsciously knows she treats him better, he gets insulted more than his younger brother. It's evident that my SO is her GC. She wasn't strict with alcohol with him but with BIL he still isn't allowed to drink even though the law allows it.
My SO gets blamed for a lot of things 

- "" you were out but you didn't buy [specific thing] I forgot to tell you about ?! I am such a bad mother""~MIL

- "" we are late and you told us to hurry up?! How dare you I am your mother you can't speak to me like that. Shut up!""~MIL

-""you weren't allowed to continue school and now you are at home helping your mother with the housework ?! How dare you,because of you we are poor.....economy sucks...banter about politics...""~FIL

-"" You should protest on the streets company owners are treated unfairly ( FIL owns a company). You should do something while you are young...banter about politics...""

I worked up the courage to post because of the second point. 
It seems rather harmless but it was blown out of proportion. FIL and MIL were both 20 minutes late and both screamed at SO. 
Rather MIL screamed and FIL threatened to stay at home. And why did they make such a big deal out of it? 
We wanted to go eat in a restaurant because MIL was to lazy to cook.
SO booked a table because they asked for it and knew about it for at least 4 hours. When it was time to get there they suddenly had to change their clothes and clean up.And my SO the angel that he is started to put a little pressure on these two and they snapped.
Funny enough it was not the first time that happened.

They pressure my SO toll make plans where everyone is included and every time we have to get going they suddenly have shit to do.

Have I mentioned I have anxiety and can't handle stress or sudden plan changes. After eating ( yes we went to the restaurant, yes it was awkward, yes I got drunk ) we got into talking and a discussion between MIL and me ensued. ( For any one that's interested it was about euthanasia for humans ) and it got to the point I had to use the nuclear bomb ( i.e telling a story about my fucked about childhood and cry ) because she wouldn't listen to my opinion even though I stated it was my opinion and I respect hers. But the good thing is on that day she didn't gaslight my SO.

I thought it was over but no she holds very deep grudges.

The next day every thing seemed normal. We made jokes, talked about life the usual things.

Then when it was time to clean up ( it were just MIL, SO and I) she started again: how she felt disrespected and insulted and SO did everything wrong.When he pointed out that MIL only found issues with SO, she went ballistic. She screamed, gaslight and changed the words SO was saying. He went out of the house I waited for him and we talked. 
He doesn't know what to do.How can he change this?Why is it always going this way ?

I told him that he has to get out of there as fast as possible but that his brother will suffer the same fate as the families SG.

I told him about this sub and asked if he wanted to post something or if I should. 

As you can see I posted and I would love to have as much advice as you can give me.

If anything is unclear feel free to ask.

"First time poster, love the community and thank you in advance for reading this.

TL;DR MIL does what she wants with no regard for our time/privacy.

Husband and I live in a one bedroom, been married for 3 years.  I was originally stoked not to have the stereotypical ""MIL"" problems, and for the most part, MIL is decent.  Like she isn't actively passive aggressive towards me, and I know she loves me in her own way, but MAN does she get under my skin.

Yesterday was my first day off this week and our apartment needed some TLC, we needed groceries, laundry is piling up, etc.  Husband and I had decided to run the errands and then spend the rest of the day getting stuff around the apartment done.  Mind you, I'm in school, so my time is extremely limited.  Husband's works schedule is weird, so our sleeping habits cater to him, and we usually don't go to sleep until 0130 or later (which means our average wake up time is 1000).  

I can't even count how many times I've told MIL our arrangement due to husband's work.  

Yesterday, Husband tries to call MIL (his mom) around 1000 to tell her we were leaving asap, so like, don't really bother coming over, because we won't be here and we don't really have the time to spare just kind of visiting.  She texts Husband around 1005 and says ""we're on our way"".  Thirty seconds later the doorbell rings and I can hear the key in the lock.  I am still in my nightgown, which isn't exactly appropriate for visitors.  I have to change, and I accidentally slam the bedroom door as they walk in.  No knock, no ""hello hello"" as they walk in.  Husband is irate and asking why they just walked in, and he told them we were leaving in less than 5.  She's like ""oh it's ok, we only have to divide up this food"" (food is another peeve, but I won't get into that here).  We don't have a huge fridge; it holds enough for just the two of us, and that's if we're good about arrangement.  Husband is just standing there like ""what are you doing?  We don't want your food, we're about to go to the grocery store, and we don't have time for you to be in here making a mess."" 

&amp;#x200B;

She gets defensive as his dad literally dumps ice out in our sink.  She proceeds to ask if we want any of the food they're taking.  Which is a hard no because she is the worst cook and eats the most horrendous foods ever and she isn't at all sanitary with the food she has.  She's been known to leave food out on the counter for days, and not pies or fruit, but meat or milk products that should be refrigerated.  She has sent us home with 3 week old spaghetti and meatballs in the past.  I don't ever bother eating it.  We've both gotten food poisoning eating her food.   

&amp;#x200B;

So recap, PIL walk in unannounced while Husband and I are in sleep wear on the couch finishing coffee fixing plans for the day.  They use our sink to dump ice (btw, what's wrong with, idk, the gutter?) and try to pawn off whatever gross leftovers they have on us, and then MIL gets all huffy that we didn't invite them to stay.  This is probably the 4th or fifth time she's done this and I swear to goddess, I'm going to lose my shit.  The thing is, I don't want to be nasty to her, but there is almost no other way to get through to her.  I keep asking my husband to say something and like put his foot down about these visits, but she doesn't listen to him and he is not the most assertive person ever... 

&amp;#x200B;

They'd also been over on Saturday to get ready for a party.  I was at work, so I didn't have to deal with her tantrum.  That was another time she just walked in without knocking.  

&amp;#x200B;

I know none of this sounds that bad, but this isn't the first time and I am dreading them at our place, anymore.  She makes huge messes, she complains about everything, can't ever just chill out and relax, and ""makes plans"" but is a horrible communicator.  

What do I do?!  Do I take their key away and how?  Like how do I even talk to her about this, without causing a fight?  Is that even possible?  I'm so frustrated...

&amp;#x200B;

(For context, his parents live 3 hours away and have both retired early.  They decided to sell their perfectly lovely home where my husband grew up to live in a house three times the size for just the two of them.  Literally everyone told them not to do it; don't move, you're going to hate; you're going to regret selling the house; there are only two of you, the house is perfect, why would you ever sell, yada yada.  Fast forward three years, and everyone was right.  But try to mention any of this to MIL and she gets defensive af, starts insisting no one supports her (despite her asking for advice and then doing the opposite) and then she like gets her feelings hurt?  And pouts?  Maybe she sulks, even?  I don't know how to describe it, but she gets all crab-assy and starts to mumble about how everything is always her fault, and no one can ever just be happy for her.)",JUSTNOMIL
" 

So, a few months ago (deep into the cut off) Susan decided that she was going to use my child's photo as her cover/profile photo on social media. It was old, but still. She has pedophile friends, so I do not want my child associated with her. (to summarize that, I kept reporting, FB kept taking down, she kept putting up. The final time she put her last name across my child's face and said it was a watermark and she owned the content. Long story short, she no longer has that account, but she does have several new ones).

I was frustrated after the 6th repost and set a status to public that my ""mother"" is a vile person and doesn't have permission to post my children, and it's not only wrong but illegal, and her husband is a cop. I probably should've have publicly acknowledged her, but i did. I had a TON of comments on it, and lots of people reporting for me.

Susan must've been thrilled. She went down and messaged EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON MY STATUS. She just copy/pasted and changed names, but I'll include one set... for science. She also posted publicly she doesn’t look at her daughter’s social media. 

(To summarize, Susan has a VERY vivid imagination. My daughter was 1.5 when I cut her off, and she cried to everybody because she missed her 2nd birthday-but read the post. I also do have a felony, from when I was very young. It was for bad check. Susan seems to have ""Grown"" it to Embezzlement in her head.)

That week, I got 5 emails to my old email about how ""She doesn't look at my social media so i need to stay off of hers and stop reporting my daughter's picture because she has RIGHTS TO POST HER OWN GRANDDAUGHTER"".

Just a small Susan story. There's more juicy out there, but I'm working myself up ;)",JUSTNOMIL
"Yesterday my husband and I, we visited my MIL for dinner, we do that every weekend. Me, I’m not a big fan of seafood. I eat fish but I strongly dislike all kinds of shellfish. Shrimp, crabs, mollusks, oysters, everything that lives in shells, etc. is disgusting to me. Writing about it alone is enough to trigger my gag reflex. I understand many people enjoy it but to me it’s disgusting. 

MIL kind of knew I don’t like seafood but I think she could have forgotten it because I only briefly mentioned it once. Yesterday she served lobsters. There was a whole lobster on our plates with pasta salad. I have never eaten a lobster but when I saw those antennas, those pincers and those eyes looking back at me, I was like  - I cannot do it, it’s so gross. I understand that MIL spend time cooking it and she meant well and I didn’t want to offend her at all but I knew that if I put that in my mouth, I will puke. So I just ate the pasta salad and left the lobster on the plate.

My husband ate it and MIL ate it and then she came to collect the plates to serve a dessert. That’s when she noticed that my lobster was still there. She looked at me and asked what’s wrong. I politely answered that unfortunately I don’t enjoy seafood but I loved the salad, it was delicious. 

She looked at me as if I had committed the greatest crime ever and was like ”Do you even know how much a lobster costs? I’m trying my best to make something delicious for my son and daughter-in-law and it turns out that she’s such a princess who won’t eat a lobster! It’s a delicacy in many countries, people pay a lot of money for it and you’re frowning when it’s offered to you?”

She basically started to lecture me as if I was a schoolgirl or something. One more thing about me is that to me, eating something is very connected to the looks of it. If the food looks gross, it could be the most delicious thing in the world and I won't eat it. If instead of putting the whole thing on the plate, that lobster was cut up and mixed with something or somehow prepared in a way where I couldn’t tell it’s a lobster, I might have eaten it. But if it’s just chilling on the plate, looking like it could move any moment, I just cannot touch it. I can’t.

My husband told her to leave me alone and stop trying to force on me something I don’t like. MIL took all the plates, looking very offended and then she came back with the dessert. She had made a cherry pie but she only put the plates down for herself and my husband. I told her (again, politely) that she forgot one more plate and she was like ”No, I didn’t. If you won’t eat the main course, you’re not getting the dessert either.” And she only served the pie for my husband and herself. 

I was like – ok, is that really necessary? Did I actually offend her that much by refusing the lobster? I have always eaten everything she had prepared, it’s just that this time it was something I don’t find appealing. And I have a real sweet tooth so I wanted the pie very much but obviously, I wasn’t going to grab it myself if she doesn’t want to give it to me.

My husband again asked her to stop making such drama out of it and give me the pie, it’s not that big of a deal. MIL said ”No, I won’t, because your wife disrespected me and her parents have not taught her that when you’re visiting, you must eat whatever you’re served whether you like it or not. It’s polite manners.” My husband then gave me his piece of pie which I gladly accepted. MIL didn’t like it but there was nothing she could do about it.

So now I’m just thinking, was it really my fault? It was like scolding a child – you didn’t eat this, so you’re not getting that. But I honestly would have vomited if I touched the lobster. When I saw them cracking the shells, chills went down my spine. I swear I’m not a picky eater but there are some things I just cannot force down my stomach.",JUSTNOMIL
"Apologies if this is a bit incoherent. I've been trying to sort of suppress these thoughts because there's really nothing I can do right now about them, and so it felt like just ignoring them was better, but now I just kind of want to let them out.

My fiancee's family seems to be literally all narcissists. My MIL definitely leads the pack. I see no sign of narcissism in him. I have no idea how he escaped, but it seems like the rest of them can't see beyond the tips of their fingers.

We've had so many incidents that just make me want to bang my head on our dining table. Some of them I try to laugh off. Like when the fiance asked the MIL to please consider how far the venue she's picking is for me (the bride) and she responded about herself instead with ""It's very close for me"". 

They also seem to think that finding a venue that I can get to in a reasonable time frame (and there are plenty that are in between our homes) is a HUGE concession. So I have asked if they can have the wedding without me, in which case, they can certainly pick it somewhere that's a 3 hour drive for me and a 10 minute drive for them. If they want me there, maybe 1 hour for each side would be good. (I know that doesn't add up, but its because of traffic patterns at commute times, which is when our wedding will be - also not by our choice.)

Most recently his uncle has gotten involved in our wedding planning to help mediate. We thought it was going well until this weekend. We have adjusted the day, time, location, style, religion, language, duration, etc of our wedding to all match what his family wants exactly. Because they told us if we didn't do that they wouldn't attend at all because they ""don't believe in vows"" how we want to do them. His family told mine that we can at least pick out what dress I'm wearing. Not even really a concession, but I'll take what I can get. Then this weekend, they want to take that back too and his family wants to pick my dress. When we tried to explain to the uncle that this is unreasonable, he said ""You guys are getting everything you want. We just wanted our timing and our ceremony exactly as it should be but everything else is yours.""....what?! basically their logic is ""We just want one thing, and the one thing is that everything should be done exactly how we want."" They literally are trying to take my and my family's ability to pick my own wedding dress. They've already told me how to do my hair etc. It's all infuriating.

I am a very independent and strong-willed person. I'm don't follow when the rules don't make sense, and I don't participate in things that I don't believe in. I have no issue standing against the norm. This whole thing is so anathema to who I am.

And please don't think this is all on my fiance. We are navigating this together as best as we can, without completely alienating his family. We realize they're the unreasonable ones, and in many ways we are allowing them to terrorize us by complying. We know the answer to all this is to tell them to buzz off and to take over our wedding. I dont think thats a choice unless I want to completely rip their family to shreds and completely crush my fiance in one fell swoop. He and I both recognize their deficiencies but they're still his family. And I wish they didn't create this dynamic of ""do this or we'll hate you forever"" but that's where we are. And i just hate it.

Instead what we're trying to do is to find little straws of comfort and familiarity and personalization in this whole disaster, to just give us some solace. I guess that's why I'm so frustrated right now, because they're even trying to snatch those little things away from us.",JUSTNOMIL

"So I've started writing posts so many times, but it's hard to find a place to start. There's just so much to share, which isn't really a good thing. If you aren't interested in hearing backstory you can skip to the ** below.

So me and DH have been together for 5 years. I came into the relationship with a 2 year old daughter. She is 7 now and we have a 3 year old son.

DHs sister lives in Ohio but DHs brother lives in the same town as us, in Florida.

MIL treats BIL and his family very differently than she does us. When I first met her, her grandkids were 1 &amp; 2 (6 &amp; 7 now) she had them every weekend. She does special things with them &amp; BILs wife. BIL had been in and out of jail for most of his adult life. It wasn't until right after I met DHs family that BIL at 36 years old, went to rehab, got out, got his life together &amp; pursued his dream of being a tattoo artist. Just this past year he finished his apprenticeship. He is good at his job &amp; we are all very proud of him. We have a good relationship with BIL &amp; his wife. We don't hold it against them that MIL treats them better.

DH has always been the good kid. Never got in trouble with the law, got a job at 16, graduated &amp; worked his way up the latter. He is a sous chef at a good restaurant &amp; works very hard at a high stress job. He is passionate about food but he still gets crap from his mom about his career choice. Even more so lately since BIL started making more money than DH. She thinks DH has a low class job.

When I first moved here, 2 hours away from my hometown and my mom I fell into a depression for a few months. I'm an only child and it was my first time on my own &amp; so different. I missed my mom very much. Well I didn't keep a very clean house &amp; gained 15 pounds. She gave DH &amp; me such a hard time about it. She thought I was lazy &amp; worthless even though DH constantly told her otherwise.

Due to an unfortunately long story, MIL moved in with us. I haven't worked the past year because, with MIL giving DH money for her living here, I was able to quit and stay home with our son when he was diagnosed with autism. I stay home to give him the extra attention &amp; teaching that he needs as he is 3 &amp; nonverbal. He starts school this august but until then we wanted to give him as much help as we could.

Because I don't work, MIL still sees me as a lazy person. She knitpicks the house if it isn't always perfectly clean. She thinks I should spend every waking second teaching our son. I like to knit &amp; sew while he plays, she thinks it's a waste of my time. She asked if I'm the reason our son is autistic &amp; insisted I must of done drugs while pregnant. She doesn't take our kids to the movies or play parks like she does BILs kids. She doesnt brag about DH or our kids, only BIL and his family.

The only reason she is still here is because every time we are fed up with her, she begs to stay &amp; says she will change, that we can't just ""throw her on the street."" DH isn't short on spine. He always puts his mom in her place, he has her stubbornness but he also gave in and let her move in with us because ""it's his mom and she needed him, we would do the same for your mom."" I hurt for DH because I think all he wants his his mom's approval, to say she is proud of him.

There is an end in sight. When our lease is up, we are moving to a new house. She isn't invited and she knows that.

**So anyway, what pushed me to finally write all this.

MIL has been extra b*tchy today.

It's the 3 year anniversary of her mother's death. She took off work to go to the beach where she let her mom's ashes go into the water. Well I agreed to babysit BILs kids today and when they showed up she got mad. Said today is her day and now it's ruined. How her grandkids being at the house is ruining her day I can't understand?? But she has been mopping around, said she can't go to the beach now. Which I still can't think of a single thing that's stopping her? She started an argument with me. Which would normally be forgiven since I understand she lost her mom but it's not. I lost my mom on May 2nd. It's been a little over a month &amp; she expects me to feel sorry for her that she ruined her own day? I'm grieving myself &amp; wouldn't put up with her pity party today. She said no one cares about how she feels. DH told her that losing someone isn't an excuse to be a b*tch. I've heard her on the phone telling her sisters that we treat her badly. She loves to be a victim, it's her favorite role.

I don't have my mom to vent to anymore, so posting here seemed like a good outlet. I have many stories that I'm honestly looking forward to sharing &amp; getting out. She may not seem that bad right now, but once the pieces are laid out you guys will understand what I put up with.

To anyone that read my novel of a post, thanks for your time.",JUSTNOMIL
"Just had a psycho conversation with MIL.   


She had planned on buying a house for my boyfriend as an investment property for him to handle, so we went to go look at houses. I specifically said that even though I was going to tag along and go look at places, that I would have no comments on the purchase since it I'm not the one buying the house. This was made VERY clear between my boyfriend and I. So my bf and I went to go look at a few houses and I loved all of them. I am Asian and believe in the superstition number ""4"" is bad luck because it means death in my culture and I was joking with the property manager about it. So the next 24 hours go by.   


The following day (today), my boyfriend is upset because MIL calls him and doesn't want to buy him the house anymore. She said that I ""fed him information"" and that me believing in superstitions is a the ""biggest piece of bull shit"" she's ever heard. She claims that when her and my bf were looking at houses, he was happy, but then after my bf and I came back, my boyfriend didn't seem as happy. I honestly think it's because he saw the houses twice and the excitement levels goes away the second time around. Anyways, I (respectfully) told her she is free to believe what she wants and I was just having a casual convo with the property manager and she can buy whatever house she wants and that my favorite one was the one that SHE likes as well. She tries to spin the convo and says that I don't know what I'm talking about and that I like the other one and was against her. I never said that.  


Then, MIL starts going OFF on me. Starts saying that my bf and I are not working out (relationship wise) and that she thinks I am a bad influence to him. Starts going back to  claiming that I am ""brainwashing"" him and not supporting him among other things. She calls my BF and tells him to tell me to get out of the apartment which I pay 70% for. Boyfriend defends me saying that I pay for most of it anyways and she is INSANE for trying to kick me out of my own apartment and says to her she can't do anything about it. This prompts MIL to call me and I (stupidly) pick up and she's yelling at me at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

She's telling me to pack all of my stuff up and go because I'm terrible for her son. I shut her up quick and let her know that she has no right to be saying these things and to tell me why she thinks the way she does. She starts telling me about how my culture is full of shit, and that I don't support my boyfriend, that I'm overweight, and that she thinks I'm in a relationship for money and that I only care about myself because I get paid well and can handle my own finances better than my boyfriend. Again, I correct her and let he know she is assuming things and making up  stories to fit what she wants to believe.   


She is now blaming me for:  
1. Thinks I'm making my boyfriend turn against his own mother regarding the house due to my one comment (which I already said and made it clear it's not my house, I'm not saying shit, I was just having casual convo).   
2. I don't support my boyfriend because he hasn't gotten a raise in 2 years and I'm not doing anything about it, whereas I have a salary job and benefits.  
3. She blames me that he and I are on the ""chubby"" side and not super fit.   
4. I've wanted to get a dog and she is forbidding me to get one while I am in this relationship and is constantly saying how if I got a dog it would die because I can't take care of it.  
5. Blames me for the things my bf says to her when he is defending me because his words are against hers when he defends me.

&amp;#x200B;

I was blunt with her and I said I didn't appreciate her attacking me, and she claimed she was not attacking me. She also then tried to spin the story and said that she never thought that my superstitious beliefs were bullshit when she did in fact say that over the phone. She then says that I'm too emotional and needs to grow thicker skin. She proceeds to go back and forth, somewhat changing the things she says, saying that she heard me say x, y, z when I never said those things. And then ends the conversation saying that she still thinks I'm a nice person and hopes that I don't hold any grudges against her.  


But then after saying that, she then says she doesn't understand how we can be in a 4 year relationship and not be married. (My bf and I are not married because we are not in a rush to get married. We'd like to be financially stable, saved up a good amount of money, then be ready. As of right now we are not and have other goals. This does not mean we love each other less or is not committed to the relationship).   


MY HEAD HURTS. I've been crying, and my boyfriend has been yelling at his parents for the way they have been talking to me. I've tried to be upfront about how I felt only to have them invalidated by MIL and I don't know what to do!",JUSTNOMIL
"1.  Not letting her granddaughter called her ""Grandma"" bc she thinks it's too outdated of a term. She prefers her given name or to be called ""Mommie.""

2.  Constantly reminding her only daughter that her son's girlfriend was better than her at everything.  Returned an item to the store? So-and-so does that way better than you. Yes, that happened.

3.  Competes with you on everything.  You got your nails done.  MIL gets hers down the next day.  You got your hair done.  MIL is booking her appt for tomorrow.  You buy 100 period pads.  She is getting 100 period pads too, even though she already has a box of 58 in the closet.

Or with ppl: My grandchild likes to play with you, oh...she likes to play with me WAY more. 

Believe me, you have not seen crying.  She cries way harder for me when she has to go home.

4.  At dinner in public. You need to trade seats with her, half-way through eating.  Yes, the foof was already served.  She prefers your booth chair to her wood chair. 

5.  You try to clean-up in and around her house, be prepared for a huge mess or disaster in the next 24 hours. 

6.  You SO and you like to eat at the kitchen table like normal ppl.  She is not having it.  Her garden shoes are on top of  the kitchen table now.  You remov them.  Oh, she is bringing 5 other pairs of shoes down and lining them up on top of the kitchen table.  That'll show you. 

7.  She is using your expensive beauty supplies in the shared bathroom, but don't you dare touch her Gatorade Zero or her Sparkling Ice, bc she has labeled everything ""Mom.""  Meaning it's hers!  But fyi, she is drinking your sparkling water, and don't you dare say a word to her. How dare you be so selfish! 

8.  Every noise bothers her.  You and SO, the TV is too loud.  You and SO are talking too loud. 

Now the shower is too loud, no more showers after 10: 30 p.m.  

Okay, no flushing toilets after 10:30 p.m., it's too loud. 

Hey, your walking in the hallway on the wood floors. Yeah, it's too loud, it bothers her. Try to keep it down. Walk lighter!!!

9.  Talks to my SO like he is her b*cth. Do this! NOW! Pick that ice cube the fell from ice maker up. NOW! MIL is not picking up her own ice off the floor. That's beneath her. Lol. 

10.  Tells you in that every single family member, SUCKS, he ex husband - lame, her daughter - spoiled brat, her son, my SO - good-for-nothing.  She is surrounded by complete incompetence.  It only you knew how hard she had it.  Nobody understands her strife in life. 

11.  She always tells you how YOU feel....you must be so disappointed, you must be so happy, you must be so annoyed.  Uh, what...???

12.  Your personal property seems to keep getting lost or broken.  You never lose things, so where and what is happening. 

13.  She won't let you leave a conversation with her, if you have to run an errand, what should have been 5 minutes convo, turns into a 2 hour conversation, bc she literally demands your time and attention. Mostly your attention, and you better not cut her off.  You will pay the price.  She will make sure of it. 

She will literally tell your SO that you are being rude and disrepctful to her in a text, even though you gave her 1 hour. What gives!???

14.  She loves her grandchild more than anything in the world, but gosh, her grandchild, is too much, and her daughter should have never had one.  Tells you it's her daughter worst mistake in life. 

And always tells her daughter, I would love to be with you, but your child, would be a distraction, so don't bother coming over. In fact, my son's OP is here, so I don't need you. 

But if it's convenient, she needs grandchild to parade around at church in a cute dres to all her church friends.  And daughter better hand the child off to her. 

But babysitting, ugh, no way. My son or his OP, can handle the child.  Would you mind OP?  I need some me time.  I'm just so overwhelmed.  Life isn't fair. 

15.  Son-in-law better mow her lawn, clean her gutters, fix her plumbing in her house for free.

Her ex-husband is a ""good-for-nothing.""  My son, my SO, is not capable. 

But you, oh yes, you!  You are SO handsome and strong, my daughter doesn't deserve you; rather, she is so lucky to have you.  Come by anytime you want, and bring my adorable grandbaby too.

16.  MY FAVORITE: 

Her plotted and set-up DRAMA Shows, where she plays different roles, Victim, Hero, you name it.

A. Your windshield gets smashed in her driveway on her private property, the first week you live with her.

She finds out her son, my SO, is paying for it. She must contribute. She is the matriarch. Let me help you and my son out.  Take the weight off of him.  

B.  Your headphones go missing, they must be in her backyard. Even though you weren't in the backyard. 

This is after she lost her OWN headphones, turns out she left them at her work in her office.  She found hers. I never found mine.

C.  MIL admires your favorite earrings. They are broken the next time you go to wear them. Have to pay $ 35.00 at fast fix to repair them.

D.  Mother's Day, night of: she has this mysterious rash on her elbow. She was in backyard gardening that day. Has no idea what it is, but it worried.

Mother's Day at daughter's house: first, the time of the event is changed from 5 p.m. to 1 p.m., so son, my SO, and I, cannot attend. Her has weekend work.  MIL says I can come without SO, I agreed.  I call to go over lil later, but....

....MIL has forced her daughter to take her to urgent care.  Party cancelled! Sorry you can't make it OP, this rash cannot wait until Monday a.m. bc it's serious. Life-threatening, in fact (::sarcasm::).  

And tell son-in-law's MIL, don't even bother coming over.  She can go home too.  This is the Mother-daughter duo show, where daughter caters to mom.  

Pssh...and you though MIL would Share Mother's Day with 2 other mom's, her daughter and the son-in-law mom. 

THINK AGAIN!!!  This is her day, and she is in need of medical attention.  

Result: 2 hours at Urgent Care, Poison Ivy rash. 

E.  8 a.m. - the top shelf in the highest top cabinet in the kitchen with pasta sauce, pickles, etc., mysteriously comes crashing down.  Looks like someone took a hammer to the glued into the wall Peg.

O.m.g. - MIL is so helpless.  Huge mess. On her own.  What is she going to do?  Wake up the OP, of course, and demand she come down and help her.  She can't do it alone.  Cleaning it hard. Besides, it's beneath her. For grunt workers.  And she has to be somewhere....in like 4 hours. What is she going to do....a 2 hour job, in 4 hours....Impossible. 

Oh, she must call daughter too, let her know that OP, is helping her. Daugher offers help, she lives 5 minutes away and is a stay at home mom.

Well, MIL would like her help, but that 5 yo would get in the way. In fact, she doesn't need daughter anymore, I have OP now. Just wanted to call and let you know about the 1. Drama, and 2. That I don't need you.  Have a nice day!!!

Cheers everyone on JustNoMIL!!!",JUSTNOMIL
"Sorry I'm back ... and huge thank yous to everyone who has read and commented on my posts so far throughout this journey on handling MIL and supporting SO (and me) coming out of the FOG!

(oops, this turned out to be quite long, sorry!)

We retreated back to NC after we broke it briefly, and we were once again getting back to ""normal"".  My SO has been going to his therapist every week, and it's been great to see him discovering his boundaries.  The side effect is that I sometimes feel like I've got a teenager in the house but hey ho, it is what it is.

Back to Grimhilde - she clearly can't handle that we are once again NC.  SO has fully blocked her, I have her on muted notifications and filtered her emails away.  I shit you not - in one 10 minute period she has:

1. Tried to ring me twice
2. Left me a voicemail
3. Messaged me on the Bookface
4. Tried to ring me on the Bookface video thing
5. Left me a voicemail on the Bookface
6. Emailed me twice

All to say - YOU NEED TO RING MEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!

For fuck's sake, woman!!

Since that wasn't enough, she is now talking shit about us to ANYONE who give her the time of day.  This includes extended family, and her friends.  All about how she is ""heart broken"", that we are ""so cruel"", that she has ""done everything to make things right"" but obviously it's ALL OUR FAULT that we won't speak to her.  The bad thing is - it's working.  Even people that we thought would see the truth have come up to say ""but she's your motherrrrr"".  

As much as it hurts, we've decided the axiom of ""those who mind, don't matter; and those who matter, don't mind"".  So we've still not responded to anything from these wannabe FMs, or to Grimhilde.  So, of course, she steps it up a notch.

Grimhilde then catfished us by hijacking FIL (who is in the early stages of a bad disease) 's phone and madly tried to ring both of us.  Now, we deliberately did not block FIL just in case he decides to ring us.  We still do want some relationship with him even though he is definitely an enabler.  Luckily SO and I did not pick up as we were busy with work.  SO texted me and goes - do you wanna bet it's Grimhilde?

Then I get an Bookface message saying - \[SO\] NEEDS TO RING HIS FATHER IMMEDIATELY!!!

Fuck my life.  It took ALL of our self control to NOT react to this absolute blatant bullshit from this woman.  How fucking DARE she try to fake some emergency / create panic that we NEED to ring his father IMMEDIATELY?!!  I couldn't help it - I just emailed her and said - was that you using FIL's phone to ring us?  She said - YES IT WAS, I JUST WANTED TO CHAT!

OH FOR FUCK'S SAKE!!!  I went back to ignoring her but the damage was already done.

That little bit of hope that FIL was calling SO, then that bit of panic button pushing, really set my SO off.  Once again he was off on his cycle of FOG and it really breaks my heart.  Suddenly it was like he just regressed back to being in the FOG, doubting his self worth, feeling obligated to make Grimhilde happy ... it just really kills me to see it.  

I really don't know what to do - we have now blocked FIL's number as well on SO's phone but I am hoping for some advice / TLC / anything from you wonderful people on how to support SO, and how to manage Grimhilde and her smear campaign.  We are definitely maintaining NC after this bit of bullshit.

Thanks so much for reading all of this x",JUSTNOMIL
"Hello all.  Long time lurker, and commenter,occasional poster.  My daughter occasionally posts about VK as well.  

Recent events at my home, where my college age daughter and I live, have lead us to have to evacuate on a temporary basis.  We have no other place to go for various reasons, so this is it.  

I work full time and do classes online to finish my degree.  My mother sees this as one's big slumber party.  We see it as a fresh level of hell. 

Vk lives and breathes TV. She will burst in while I'm doing homework to insist I come see this dog on the news or this women's dress. If I don't comply with these requests the tantrums and screaming last longer and interrupt me more than seeing the dog, so I go along to get it done.  She's will then have a 45 minute discussion about the dog, or the dress.  

She's goes through our things while we are gone to work.  Checking our medications, going through papers etc. I feel like I'm a teenager again and I'm going insane. 

She's questions me on my daughters where abouts, and why my daughter did this or that.  It's not my mother's business. 

She tells me she doesn't want to return her sister's call because all her sister does is complain about being sick.  She then calls sister and plays sick Olympics, finally clenching what she sees as victory by announcing she will likely die first.

I had been on a diet losing weight.  Her constant need to make me eat the food she prepares, or face the tantrum, have driven me crazy.  

I have to listen to a laundry list of who has wronged her today,  Why they are evil scum, and how they don't care about her.  She will expect a response other than my usual grey rock ""uh huh"" "" oh"". Then storm off pissed. These often include that neighbor said he could help her  do x task. It has been 3 days neighbor is going to hell for not doing this task within her expected time frame.  In most of these conversations I hear the person say "" I can probably help with that sometime"" she hears"" I will be over in 5 minutes to do this instantly and to your exact specifications""

The loss of a puzzle piece ended in a screaming crying breakdown comparing her trials in life to the suffering of Jesus. It devolved from her being angry to her threatening to kill her pets for losing the piece ( she wouldn't hurt then, don't worry) to her having a mental breakdown claiming she was being crucified  while crying hysterically.  I thought to myself people will never believe this. It was like watching aliens walk on my front lawn while sipping wine thinking,  I can't tell anyone they will think I'm nuts. I would have to film it for them to believe it's real.  

The other problem is we are supposed to go on a vacation with her in about 5 weeks. If we are not out of here before then to have some personal space I'm going to  lose my frigging mind. No we're can't cancel the vacation.  It would be nice but not possible. 

Thank you for listening to me rant,  hopefully with no judgment.",JUSTNOMIL
"  

Hi! It’s been a few weeks since I last posted, and no update on the whole MIL-situation except that I am still NC, she is blocked on my phone (she wasn’t on my social media to begin with) and unfortunately, SO is in contact but is very low contact. 

We are not where I want us to be, but I’m tired of having the same fight over and over where he is partly in the FOG again where ‘she didn’t mean it that way (my reply: “she f\*king threatened with a lawyer for GPR when our LO was only 4 weeks old because she couldn’t stand my “no kisses on the face”-rule”, and ‘I’m too hateful as a person now to them after “all” they did for him’ – my reply: “Like what? Feed you, give you clothes and other normal stuff that a parent is required to do? That’s not doing a lot for your kids, that is doing the bare minimum at least!” etc… - but he does realize why I don’t want any contact, and why I want as limited contact as possible between our LO and her and complies as far as possible. He is also in agreement that she is to get no alone time at all during his visit there, the visit is limited in itself (1 hour, 1,5 hour max) and LO will never ever be there alone, unsupervised, I don’t care how the relationship ever evolves. 

ILs have shown their true colors and even though I can’t forbid my SO to no longer go there, I have told him that I have no trust in them whatsoever and I nor my LO feel or are safe in that house (ILs would not physically attack us, but I mean the verbal snide remarks and attacks I have endured the past entire 5 months of LO’s life even though I’ve been NC for the past 3 of those 5).

Anyhow, this was actually not about that situation but now onto the explanation of my title: “Help with good comebacks to BEC-remarks of mother”.

My parents are absolutely wonderful grandparents, and even though my mother sometimes threads the line of my boundaries by well-meaning remarks, she usually realizes herself that she is interfering a bit too much and backs down. I’m also not afraid to stand up against her, and will tell her that we are the parents and though we appreciate her guidance, we will do what we think best. She usually complies without any further remarks.

However, there is 1 thing that is quite BEC and I have not yet found a suitable remark yet and hope the JustNOMIL-hive mind can help me with some witty, fun remarks that won’t hurt her feelings, but bring across that I don’t really like what she’s implying. When my LO is there, you can tell he really likes her and it completely relaxed. I love that their bond is already good, and wish for nothing else BUT my mom will make remarks like “oh, he loooves cuddling me, look, LO, your mom is jealous, …” – She does not mean it malicious, but more in a teasing way as this is what we do in our family. I’d just like to give good comebacks without hurting her feelings but also making clear to her that I’m the mother and I will always come first, so yes, it does bother me to some extent, but I want to make that clear to her in a witty way. 

Not sure if I’m wording my intentions correctly but hoping that you all will get it. At the moment, all I’ve said is things like: “Yes, when he’s here, he loves cuddling with you but I get the most of his cuddles”, or something like that.

Can you give me some advice, or some fun comebacks? Again – she does not have mean intentions, it is normal in our family (and in the extended family) to be a bit “rude” to each other in a loving way but I don’t have the quickwit during moments like that so all help welcome! Thanks!",JUSTNOMIL
"Every time we have an argument my SO blows up and calls his mom to tattle tale. Over the last several months she has decided to take it upon herself and comment on my Facebook photos, posts, etc. telling me to be nice, that's rude, she gives me very rude advice about cleaning and housework, etc. She has said off color things to me when SO is not around - he doesn't. Elieve me or he tells me I'm overreacting. My last post was a photo of polygel nails I did on myself. I just started doing my own nails and thought it was so cool. She commented ""Wow! Can't wait for you to do mine when I fly out to see you guys! ♥️ So excited!!"" I let it slide, ignored the comment. I thought it was rude and presumptuous. I just spent like $120 and bought the kit for myself only. I wasn't offering service and or my time up whatsoever. 

The next day SO and I go to the zoo together and we get in a fight over me backseat driving. I was not rude at all, but he blew up and proceeded to call me names and call his mom to tell her how I am the worst. He tells me ""Wow, I feel better now. Talking to my mom helped, it doesn't matter what she said though."" She has told him before I'm a toxic person. I am trying to take him away from his family, I'm a bitch, etc. I have heard her talk about other people, so I can imagine what she says about me when he calls her. I blocked her in immediately after this because I'm not going to deal with her butting into the relationship and commenting on my social media or texting me because he decided to involve her in this. This isn't a 3 person relationship. It's her son and I. She's not involved. I understand my SO isn't treating me good lately, but I think his mom is taking it way too far and not respecting me as an adult. 

Was blocking her going too far on my part? She causes bigger issues in the relationship and I am done dealing with her. I kind of feel bad about it now because I did it in the heat of the moment. I was just so done with her being involved and giving her opinion when she has no idea about our relationship. We live in Hawaii. She lives in the Midwest. I don't know if I am overreacting to her.",JUSTNOMIL
"My MIL was oh so aptly named by somebody here as Slurella.  My MIL is the one who used a very derogatory &amp; offensive racial slur to describe an African-American coworker, then got all offended &amp; upset when another African-American coworker didn't forgive her for saying it. It's been ages now since Slurella worked anyway and that's a good thing for everyone.

Anyway, I found out 3 weeks ago that I have breast cancer. It sucks.  It's been an emotional roller coaster.  But in about 2 weeks, I'm having a mastectomy.  It was caught early thanks to a mammogram (get your boobies checked out, ladies!  Starting at age 40!).  And I don't need chemo or radiation.  But it's still scary nonetheless.  Am waiting for genetic testing results to see if I get to have a single or double mastectomy.  DH perked up a bit when I joked that he could help me pick out the new boob.

It's going to be a 3- month long process from 1st surgery to 2nd surgery when they swap expander boob in for implant boob.  And thanks to where my 2nd tumor is, I don't get to keep the nipple.  I'd rather live, though, than have a nipple.  Apparently, they have a tattoo artist on staff at the cancer center whose sole job is to tattoo fake nipples on women who've had reconstructive surgery.  Interesting.  I never knew that before.

DH suggested that we take a quick weekend getaway somewhere just before I have to go out on a month-long medical leave for the 1st surgery.  I agreed this is a good idea.  We decided to go visit SIL (DH's sister) &amp; her family.  Yesterday, DH told Slurella of these plans.  Slurella is blind enough now that she can't drive, which is pertinent to today's tale.

DH also went to visit Slurella because after a week, he apparently missed his mommy.  Whatever.  But I'll give him a pass on that since in the very near future, he won't have the time to go fawn over Slurella because he'll be taking care of me instead.  Well, during that visit with Slurella, she said that she wanted to go with us to visit SIL next weekend.  Didn't ask if it was ok for her to join us, of course.  Just announced that she wanted to go, too.  DH told her no.  Of course, when Slurella asked why, DH then stupidly threw me under the bus and said it was because I'd probably say no and because this trip was about what I wanted to do.

Um, first of all, YAY for Slurella not coming with us.  But BOO for DH not sticking up for me.  I told DH, ""Yeah, there's no way I'd want to drive her out there again. I'd rather stay home.""  DH didn't like hearing this, but given my current health situation, that lovely song entitled ""I have no more Fucks to give"" sung by an awesome British guy in a men's suit shop (do a search for it on Youtube, it's hilarious) comes to mind.  Because, well, I really DO have no more fucks to give.  I don't give a fuck if she wants to come or not because it's not about her.  I'm having major surgery soon and they're going to take my entire breast off, ok?  I get to recuperate with drains and everything.  Oh, you want to be driven hundreds of miles away for a free ride to visit your other kid?  Here's the world's smallest violin playing just for you, Slurella.  I couldn't give a rat's ass WHAT you want.

On top of all of this, Slurella offered to come and stay with us for awhile after I have the mastectomy so she can ""help.""  WTF?  And in addition to that, DH stupidly said, ""Well, I'm thinking of taking my mom up on her offer.""  I told him, ""Hey, I am the patient here. I am the one going through this. Don't \*I\* get a say in this?  When we are all healthy &amp; able bodied, we all end up having to cater to her and wait on her hand and foot when she's here.  And you think that she's going to be able to cook meals (gag) and clean and do laundry?  Forget it.  The kids are able bodied people and they can chip in and we don't need her help.""

Besides, she's a type 2 diabetic who doesn't manage her disease very well, so she has these scabs and wounds on her forearms and lower legs that look horrific.  No fucking way do I want Slurella aka Disease Louise in my house spreading whatever fucking germs she might be carrying and spreading them all over my house while I am recovering from cancer surgery.

And...she doesn't even drive.  So we'd have 5 people here with only 1 person allowed to drive for up to 4 weeks.  No way.

So Slurella, sorry, but you don't get a free ride to SIL's house.  It's not about you.  This is about me for once.  ME.  MY life.  MY family.  WE are doing this and YOU ARE NOT INVITED!",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi, all. Yes, it's me again. I am so sorry for posting AGAIN - I'm trying hard not to but I'm on my own until tomorrow night and I really do need to vent. I do appreciate everyone's kindness in this sub. Luckily, Mum and step-dad are going away for 2 weeks at the weekend - hopefully a fortnight of blessed peace!

I am so sick and tired of Mum taking up so much space in my head. It's ridiculous and exhausting and I'm utterly sick of it. I almost feel like I need to be exorcised, or something! I'm sure it's just how she would want me though - always thinking of her! I certainly need detoxing. I probably sound pretty barmy at times!

Anyway, Mum phoned me earlier &amp; regaled me with the story of her morning &amp; I'm sorry, but she doesn't even sound rational. I will try and cut the story short, as she gave me lots of ""exciting"" detail which made it loooooong. She went to her carer's meeting today (yes, I know, I know lol!), which was going to be in the botanical gardens right on the other side of town, for a change. Step-dad dropped her off. Anyway, Mum was put out because her particular friend wasn't there, and everyone else seemed to just want to chat, not look at the gardens properly, which appears to have offended her so she decided to go home early and leave them to it. She also said they were stopping &amp; starting which she finds very tiring.

She asked a lady at reception where the nearest bus stop was (Mum knows nothing about this side of town and had no idea how she was going to get back, which I think was barmy given she can't walk far!) The bus stop turned out to be miles away, and when Mum got there she saw she'd just missed a bus, so decided to walk until she found a main road(!) She was exhausted by now, of course! She walked miles! But eventually she came to a main road &amp; managed to flag down a taxi, but she hadn't brought much money out with her(!) Never mind, the guy took her home - it cost £17.20 because it's miles and there was bad traffic.

I just couldn't believe it. Mum is now saying she feels really knocked up because of having to walk all that way. But why the hell didn't she a) Just call step-dad to fetch her, b) Call for a taxi before she went walking everywhere c) Not bring much money with her and d) why on earth did she abandon the carer's meeting early in the first place! One of them would probably have given her a lift! Does this seem entirely irrational to anyone else?! God forgive me, I know I sound really unsympathetic towards her but to my mind it was pretty much self-inflicted, then she dumped it all on me for some reason.

I know I post about Mum a lot, and I am so sick of her being in my head. I just want to escape, sometimes. Just want some peace! Sometimes I feel like asking her for 6 weeks separation, to just give me a chance to heal and calm down. But I can't ""abandon"" her just before her op, can I? And I'm not entirely convinced her cogntive function is firing on all cyclinders.

Although my flair says ""Advice Wanted"", I'm not sure anyone can give me any more advice at this stage. Just the space to rant is helpful!

Hopefully after this everyone can have a rest from RC while she's on holiday! Thanks for reading, again!

Edit: Thanks for your kind replies, everyone! Apologies I haven't got around to replying yet - I've had a fearful headache this evening!",JUSTNOMIL
"I recently wrote you a letter to try and explain to you how YOUR behaviour is the cause of the no contact from your adult son. 
It took me days, actual days to find the wording that was honest and truthful, without trying to be intentionally hurtful to you. I sent the letter to your psychologist at the request of your family as apparently you are too fragile from the deterioration of your relationship with your son to cope on your own. 
Your response to me via sms again showed no signs of you taking any responsibility, stating you wish you had the letter two years ago, well it was about the last two years so unless I was a psychic that isn’t likely. You offered no apology to me for your behaviour in spite of me stating you were hurting not only him but everyone around him including me. And your shouty capitals that you are here for “us” and always have been, well... it wasn’t received well. Hence why I still have not acknowledged your message.
To then receive a fb message from hubby’s aunt last night stating you had told them he wanted nothing to do with anyone in the family on Friday... I just cannot believe you. I expressed to you he was isolated by your behaviour and now you have gone out of your way to ensure that isolation. I’m furious. 
I’m furious that you are so selfish you would actively hurt your son. I’m furious you are incapable of being a mother with even the slightest amount of compassion for your child. I’m furious that in 24 years you did nothing to address his mental health issues, you did nothing to address a very apparent eating disorder, and for the last 7 years you have let me address and deal with it alone. I’m furious you have no idea what medications your child takes for bipolar, or that you have no idea that if he seems out of sorts you actually need to do something about it (like let me know) other than get upset because he is angry at you. I’m furious that you think after 12 months of him not speaking to you, it is appropriate to send him a letter telling him when he changes his mind, you will be there, when you haven’t EVER been there for him, nor have you done the one thing he asked of you prior to the no contact decision. I’m furious you are demonising him to all of your family and they (other than the aunt) are stupid enough to believe your lies. I’m furious no one else in your family is pointing out that you clearly have severe mental health issues of your own that require attention and you have a drinking problem. 
Most of all, I’m furious my partner doesn’t get the support or compassion inherently deserved from a family, from his family. I’m furious you are forcing him into a life with no support other than what we have created ourselves and my family bring willingly. 
You don’t deserve to know him, even on his worst day, he is 100 times the human you could ever dream to be. I hope your distress at this situation is genuine and you are truely hurting (although I don’t think it is and this is all for attention on your part). I hope you never again get to enjoy his company, his sense of humour or feel the extensive support he offers. I hope you have taken that opportunity away from yourself with your disgusting behaviour. 
Lastly I wish I could actually say this to you and it would have some impact, or to tell your family and have them see the truth, but it would be a waste of breath, you would find a way to turn it all around on me whilst flashing your victim card about the place. 
Enjoy your life, I hope it’s lonely and miserable. You deserve it.",JUSTNOMIL
"Racist MIL, does the situation ever improve or is this always going to be a shit storm? My DH and I have been together for 7 years total, married 2 of those years. I've never had a relationship with my MIL. DH has been honest with me since the beginning, telling me she is racist and hated me right off the bat when she found out her son was dating a ""china"". She would make fun of the way I look to the extended family members, and even say disgusting things about how our future children would look.

He is Colombian I am Vietnamese. I met his siblings and dad 2 years into the relationship, I didn't meet MIL until 4 years. The family members are fine, but we don't have a bond because she is the wedge between us. She doesn't want them to like me so they keep their distance. I have been to a few family events with extended family members where she went out of her way to make me feel not welcome. Extended family knows she's crazy messed up for how she treats me but they don't say/do anything about it. From my understanding, she is such a raging bitch when you get on her bad side that they avoid any confrontation with her. This really ticks me off actually. She was always cold to me, treats me like trash and talks about me and my family like we are so beneath her which is ridiculous, she comes from humble beginnings and works as a migrant farm worker. 

Flash froward to 7 years together and married, things are still rough. DH, who has always tried to find a balance between the life he wants with me and keeping her, cut her off earlier this year because of her rude behavior towards him and some gossip she was spreading about me. MIL is always making DH feel like shit because he doesn't let her take advantage of him financially like she does to FIL. 

Anyway, I'm saddened because I see the toll it takes on my DH. Though she's a piece of shit mom, I know part of him is really sad about the relationship lost. Extended family seems to think they'll work it out in the future and she will come around to apologizing to me but I think she's a bigot and will always be a bigot. She will always be racist. **I feel like the extended family is in denial of the gravity of the situation**In your experience, does it ever improve with a racist mother in law? What has your experience been? What advice do you have based on your experience or what you've seen with family members/close friends? 

I don't ever want to see the woman again and would not want anyone like that around my future kids. If shes not nice to me, she won't be nice to them.

MIL background: grew up in a rural Colombia, spent her childhood there caring for her younger siblings, started work in the migrant fields of central California at age 14. Not literate. Never went to school. Does not venture far from her community.",JUSTNOMIL
"I was referred to this sub, and I am SO EXCITED to find a group of people that really get it. My MIL is getting more difficult to deal with by the day. I now know a place where I can come with future issues. In the meantime, here's some of the things I've already witnessed.  


\- Threw a birthday cake at my BF when he asked her to say ""happy birthday"" to me too, since our birthdays are a day apart and we were celebrating 1 week later.  


\- Left my BF in a Niagara Falls casino and went back to her hotel room. Neither one had gotten an international plan for their phones, so he couldn't find his family for HOURS.  


\- For my BIL's birthday, he wanted to go to the new restaurant in town, but she's a very picky eater, so she made us all go to Dunkin Donuts for coffee at 7pm because she had a coupon.  


\- Told me and my SIL (not her daughter, married to BIL) that reading is ""for fat people"" and we shouldn't read books. She's a kindergarten teacher.  


\- BF and I hold monthly game nights at our house for our friends. My MIL is upset everytime because she's not invited.  


\- My SIL is very interested in ancestry research and loves to share new info when she gets it. MIL called her a Nazi for having possible German ancestry. SIL got upset and cried, so MIL called her the n-word instead.  


\- A lot of Jocasta behavior (although I call it Marie Barone) and my BF is clearly the GC while BIL is clearly not (again, Marie Barone). She is constantly saying that she wants to spend time with only my BF and no one can take her son away from her. They go to the gym together at least 3x per week, and everyone leads super busy lives. When we get a chance on the weekends, we like to spend time together, so we both get invited to the other's family events. BF has told her that he wants me involved in his family events, but he'd be happy to schedule a dinner or something with just her, but she never follows through. When they are together, she is constantly touching him - lap sitting, hand holding, and posing in pictures with him like he's her husband not not my FIL.  


\- Super jealous of my mom, who had 3 girls, while MIL only had 2 boys. Anytime my sisters come up in conversation, she makes comments about girl-only-moms and how much she loves just her boys.  


\- My parents are divorced but get along ok. I spend Christmas Eve with my dad's family, and Christmas Day with my mom's family. BF is always invited to come, but he politely declines, as he spends each day with his different sets of grandparents. I've been invited to their family Christmas events, but I politely decline to spend the days with my family. MIL said that once my dad dies (he has terminal lung cancer), I should be able to spend at least Christmas Eve with their family.",JUSTNOMIL
"This update is for all the nice people who message me and give me good advice. For others that choose to attack me, please just skip this post.

The last time we visited Snatchy, I was insanely angry. I saw red from her actions and really gave it to DH in the car. I admit I probably should be doing this to Snatchy but a part of me still wants this to just all blow over one day and for her to understand her place (crazy, I know).

After our last visit, I officially HATE Snatchy. I hate her, her language, her behavior, her face (immature, I know). 

Before, I loved my DHs native tongue, now I don’t want to learn it nor do I want my DD to learn it. I couldn’t even stand hearing my DH speak it to DD for a few days because it reminded me of Snatchy. I know this is wrong and abusive. I never told DH about how I felt about hearing his native language, I’m just telling you all how I felt.

Well during our weekly marriage counseling, DH told counselor about the trip and how I went off on him in the car. Counselor actually wanted to hear my side because she said it seemed off that I would be so angry for “small things”. I have her the full story in which she took my side. She (counselor) told DH that he needed to make a trip to Snatchys house and have that conversation that he should have made 2 trips ago. We both agreed.

I also admitted to the counselor that things were a lot worse concerning Snatchy. I told her how I HATED her and this is why the counselor said I needed to have a break so DH can talk to her. She affirmed all my feelings and said I was justified. That was nice because it’s hard just going back and forth with DH.

Anyways, there is a party coming up that is actually in our town. It’s for DHs brother and idk if I’m going and if I’m not going, DD is not going. One reason I would like to go is for DD to see DHs family (extended), a huge reason for me not to go is because Snatchy will be there.

I don’t respond to Snatchys group texts. I don’t send pictures. Lady must know something is up but she likes to play innocent or victim. I still think DH is in the fog and maybe doesn’t fully understand the situation but there has been some progress. 

Btw I know some of you keep telling me to baby wear DD but she is 30 inches and I’m 60. It’s hard to sit while baby wearing and honestly DD doesn’t mind meeting and seeing family members, it’s just Snatchy comes and hogs her the entire time or guilt trips family into handing her over.

Edit: I just wanted to clarify that my DD is 30 inches and I’m 60 inches. She’s already half my size at 9 months and it’s really hard for me to baby wear for long periods because of our sizes. Sorry for the confusion!",JUSTNOMIL
"I just wanted to start off by saying that I'm so grateful for this community. Even just typing out my thoughts gives me so much clarity.

My fiance and I have been together for years. We were long distance for a bit and finally moved to the same city this past year.

From the beginning my mom has believed he is secretly abusing me. Or it's a convenient excuse. She also falsely accused my dad of abuse and threw him out while he was dying of cancer. So this might just be her go-to. In reality, she was incredibly abusive to my father. She emotionally abused him and all of us for years. It was horribly scary. I was hospitalized for chronic depression that even great therapists eventually told me they didn't know what to do with. The day she kicked me out was the day I started getting better. I'm fully recovered now and have a great career and a wonderful life.

Anyway, back to now... my fiance and I are very happy to be committed to our Catholic faith. My mom is very much not a Catholic and has been very hurtful about this. She completely ignored the fact that we have an incredible, supportive community, and spent an entire phone call criticizing our choice to practice NFP once we are married. I know it's strange to her, and I can't ask her to approve or agree, but I am asking her to respect my choice.

She ended the conversation by saying that shes glad my fiance found a religion that HE likes, saying I'm just following his orders. Y'all... this woman had me baptized as a Catholic and raised me in the faith. My fiance was raised without religion. It was ME who insisted on using NFP. It took him thought and research to be okay with it. We know the risks and benefits, we know it's not always as reliable... and we are okay with that! I just can't understand how she can raise me in a religion and be shocked when I actually want to follow it.

This has been a pattern for her... that she thinks all the choices I make that she doesn't approve of are being controlled by a male behind the scenes. It makes me incredibly sad, to be honest. I'm very proud of my accomplishments and I think of myself as a strong woman. So for her to see me as the constant victim, and to think of my incredibly loving fiance as an evil puppet master is so insulting. She doesn't see my agency or recognize my free will.

She's flying me out to her home to visit her and my siblings this weekend (i do have an escape plan in place in case it goes south).

What I really need advice on is how to tell her WE ARE GETTING MARRIED THIS YEAR!!! We are so excited and so incredibly happy. She inevitably will not be! I want to tell her on this trip. I want to give her the opportunity to have us all go look at wedding dresses. I want to give her the chance to be there and be happy with me.

I have a friend who is a therapist. With BPD there's a huge fear of abandonment, so she reccomended I frame it as bringing my fiance into the family so she doesn't feel abandoned. Reassuring my mom I love her and I'm not disappearing... but with boundaries. My concern is that it just might ""feed the monster"", so to speak. That it might just feed her need for attention.

Should I tell her alone? I was thinking of telling her in front of my siblings so that shes required to keep her cool a little more. Should I do it in a restaurant? I really need advice, stories, experience... anything would help!",JUSTNOMIL
"Sorry, just realized the title is misleading, I'm not complaining about MIL being a sane human being. I promise I'm not a drama loving monster, because I actually have crazy bad anxiety and drama doesn't exactly help it.

Thank you everyone who has given me advice on my last several posts. I am taking all options into consideration and I joined justnoSOs too and might post there later on if something else comes up with DH I need to get off mh chest.

Right now, I just need to rant about MIL. Now if anyone read my past posts, you might know that about a week ago MIL went off on me because my son was acting like a normal baby and she thought that meant me and DH were basically screaming at each other over the phone in front of him. She accused me of cheating with some flimsy evidence, threatened to call CPS on me for having a ""dirty house"", and also called my family a bunch of liars and manipulators (when she has only ever spent about 2 hours in the same room as my father). A bit later she sent DH a text saying what she told me, conveniently leaving out her accusations and insults. All in all, it was a very upsetting situation and it honestly destroyed any inkling of respect I had left for her.

After all this, the stress caused me to lose sleep and basically stop eating for about three days. I was physically ill to my stomach just thinking about interactions with her in the future after that. I finally regained my ability to eat and sleep again after some days off with just me and LO. The day after, she had a migrane all day (probably from all the yelling she did the day before) and I hardly talked to her. And since then, she has acted like nothing happened.

I mean seriously like nothing happened at all. She has been all smiles, offering to do things, asking for favors, trying to help out with finding other jobs, etc. I have been polite, but have hardly said anything and been keeping things like my job hunt on the downlow since, frankly, its none of her business.

But seriously, how can you say that kind of something to someone and just pretend like it never happened? I am honestly flabbergasted by it. Just... what?! That is all I can say. It makes me feel like the whole thing was just a fever dream or something, but I have the evidence becauseDH sent me the text that she had sent to him that day. I feel like I'm in the twilight zone rn with this. Good lord.",JUSTNOMIL
"idk whyyyyy my MIL chooses this as her hill to die on. She *insists* on including herself in our sons doctor/hospital visits, even though I have made it abundantly clear she needs to stay home. She invited herself to my ultrasounds. She invited herself to the birth (that was a HELL NO from me). She invited herself to stay at my home for two weeks, planning to arrive the day after DS was born (again a helllllllllll no). I’ve tried explaining to her over and over and over again that I prefer my privacy while I deal with my emotions in medical situations but I would love to have her around afterwards, but she says that’s “not what family does”. 

We’re visiting my in laws currently. DS dislocated his elbow last night and guess who geared up to drive us?  Guess who decided we go to the military hospital so she *had* to drive us (were military but don’t have our IDs on us but MIL does). Guess who threw her phone across the room, stormed off, and refused to talk to me for the rest of the night when I told her just DH and I would take DS? Surprise! MIL! 

At least DH and I got to take care of our son without feeling crowded or having to fight her to back off at the hospital. DS is 100% back to normal got the nursemaids elbow popped back in to place easily!

"I’m in my teens and after spending so much time on the Internet and interacting with different people I’ve started to see issues with my mom and I’s relationship. 

Whenever my mom and I get into an argument- any argument no matter how petty- she always pulls the “father” card, and says how ungrateful and terrible of a person I am and how she’s going to buy me a ticket to live with my father in the Carolinas (I live in HI). In fact once when I was about eight, we got into an argument- I don’t remember what it was about but I do remember her words. 

She told me to pack up my clothes in a suitcase because she bought me a ticket to stay with my dad- and even went as far as watching me pack up as much clothes as I could fit in my little, pink Disney Princess suitcase and get ready to leave for the airport- I was crying and begging her to reconsider the whole time. Then after I finished packing she told me that she was not going to send me away and gave me hugs. Now idk if I am overthinking it but after reflecting I think that’s a pretty damn horrible thing to say and do. Like I was a fucking kid and she was going to put me though that? That fucking hurt and made me feel unwanted. 

Over the course of the last 5 years she’s been constantly threatening me and saying that she is going to send me away to my dad if I don’t “shape up.” (By shape up she means to be more respectful and too not criticize my sister- I’m a teenager and going through the normal rebellious stage- I do try my hardest to act respectful but I tend to speak first.) While not as often, I still cry and beg her to change her mind.

This summer I’m visiting my dad and we got into a disagreement (she messaged my dad telling him to give me chores- even though I’ve been cleaning this damn place and watching the two toddlers none stop) and I told her that this wasn’t her home and it wasn’t her place to tell him how to parent (yeah I was out of line but she does the same thing to my dad.) 

Here’s some of the things she texted me:

“How dare you repeat the same shit that fucking slob ass bitch (stepmom) said and your disgusting lazy ass father said!”

“You stay over there! Don’t fucking come back! You belong there you fucking lazy slob!”

“You will start looking like trailer park just like everyone else there! You’ll become a disgusting slob of a woman like your step mom!” 

Then a while later I get this:

“It was very hurtful what you said to me and it shows you don’t respect me”

“Is it bad that I’m enjoying you not being here for awhile?”

“I miss you, yes but the house is much cleaner. I’m not yelling n grumpy” 

That- that really hurt- she proceeded to say that she was seriously going to ask my dad if I could live here- and how “she made the decision not me” and that “that’s how much I make her life miserable.” And Oh my Gosh I know I can be a fucking brat but I was crying as I read that. That was such a blow to my self confidence- something that she prides herself on for helping me be more confident. When she said those things I felt like a piece of chewed up gum beneath her shoe. 

I talked to my dad about both my rudeness and criticizing behavior to my sister and he pointed something out to me. I act JUST LIKE MY MOM when it comes to her. And I realized that my mom might just be a verbally abusive person, but I’m still not sure.

Edit: I love my mom and I know in my heart that she truly loves me.",JUSTNOMIL
"**Backstory/ first post from Oct 2017**

My gf and I have been in a long distance relationship for two years ago. I’m 30, she’s almost 24. I wrote this about 6 months into our relationship (couldn’t remember old account password): https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/787f4k/gfs_22f_moms_crazy_behavior_is_straining_our/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ios_share_flow_optimization&amp;utm_term=control_1

it’s a doozy. Long, long story short it was looking for advice not only on various crazy outbursts including knife-wielding, but on my gf’s mom controlling her life. Her mom can’t understand my relationship is with my gf, not her. Things worked out for a month or so after writing that...until my gf said she wanted to end things. A few weeks after that, I fly out at the holidays and we work things out. 

It was during this visit I found out for over a month while we were together she had not only been on tinder talking to other guys and having explicit conversations, but trying to meet up with a few. I was devastated by what I saw. Really crushed. One of the guys had a gf at the time and they were both talking about keeping it a secret, etc. This asshole will return later in the story. 

But I forgave her. I let her know it could never happen again though, and the guys you tried meeting with need to be out of your life. We get back together and a year and a half later, here we are. Before I go into the story prompting this post, let me give a rundown of the litany of terrible things that have happened, most in the last 1.5 yrs since writing my original post:

**Examples**

- Her mom is a *bad* gambling addict. She lives for the casino, they are insanely in debt, and it affects my gf daily, yet my gf can’t see the forest through the leaves. 99% of the world would realize how huge this is, but to my gf, it’s almost become so normalized it’s a non-issue
- I can’t tell you how many times she’s cancelled my gf’s phone service to punish her; and then turns it on 45 min later 
- Calling her incessantly; many times a day, and when my gf doesn’t pick up she will call 15, 20 times in a row til she does. Even when we were traveling in Europe (she studied abroad in Italy a semester), instead of enjoying the trip my gf was crying about what her mom was saying to her
- She skipped class so we could stop in Pompeii and Sorento on my first weekend visiting (we were coming back from Amalfi). Her mom flipped out: texted me saying she’s calling the police that I kidnapped her daughter, she proceeded to call the school and all gf’s friends that her daughter was missing
- Mom’s attitude during fights: physical violence (throwing things like remotes), threatening to or saying she already called the police, at least twice she took out a KNIFE and brandished it 
- The mom cries wolf often: last summer the mom is complaining she needs to go to the hospital, dad is sick of her crying wolf and ignores her. She then nonstop is badgering my gf all morning to take her and my gf is refusing. Turns out nothing was wrong of course, but guess what? Her dad who refused to take mom yelled at my gf for doing the same thing 
- Gf’s dad and grandma (mom’s mom) are the two biggest enablers I think I’ve ever seen. They are complete and total pushovers for the mom’s tirades.
- I can’t tell you how many times her mom has called her home to “talk with her” in the middle of my visit, obviously stealing my time from her
- Gf is constantly at the mom’s beck and call: from driving 2 hours to the coast without a thank you when her mom lost her car keys in a casino, to rushing a beautiful picnic my gf were having at Gettysburg, to having us miss an event that ended at 4 pm so gf could vacuum floor and clean counters (she actually said “I’m letting your bf stay here you so you have to do what I say!”) when she could have easily done the chores anytime that night 
- Many times I’ve tried to have my gf visit she can’t because she has to “watch the dog for the weekend” while the mom goes to the casino (they’ve had neighbors watch dog, their cousin has a dog, they’ve used kennel multiple times, I showed gf an awesome dog sitting service (that I would pay for), but nothing was good enough (frankly, I think my gf was too afraid to run the ideas by her mom)
- Conversely, her mom cuts my gf’s visits to me short, like having her come home Saturday instead of Sunday saying my gf has to be “well rested” for school Monday...yet one of these return weekends she wanted her to go on a late night Sunday bus trip to Atlantic City  (so, spending Sunday with your bf before flying back is worse than spending the night out gambling?)
- She’s said NASTY things about me, mocking me any way she can.
- Only giving her two grand for an entire 4 month study abroad semester and bitching about money constantly (yet gf made sure to take thank you pictures for them everywhere we went...I spent over 10,000 on her in the month and a half I was there. No thank you from my gf. 
- Her mom has said “your bf never thanked us for letting you guys stay at [gf’s deceased grandma’s trailer]...where’s my thank you for spending 10,000 giving your daughter the European trip of a lifetime? 
- For as in debt as they are, her and her parents went to an 8,000 destination wedding in the Bahamas for her cousin...8,000 for 5 days.  Like the mom’s gambling addiction, my gf failed to see what a huge problem this was
- For Christmas she wanted a new palate, I got her $200 in Sephora makeup kits. She got me a card and a clearance sweater. She forgot them at home.
- For her birthday I got her an expensive opal ring completing her opal collection (all the other pieces except her grandma’s necklace I bought). She got me a card and a t shirt with her school logo (compare this to an ex who got me a custom made photo of me and my grandfather). She forgot the card again.
- The money, oh my god, the money they take from my gf. They nickel and dime her for everything, everything- yet constantly demand to “borrow” money, her mom has made her multiple times to go to the bank just so gf can transfer her $10. I have to pay for *everything* with my gf because she never has money. 
- In two years of dating she has never paid or planned for a visit, I have to do everything 
- Her parents made gf sign a contract saying she won’t ever move away and will pay back all parents loans 
- Kicked me out of the house (requiring me get a last minute motel) in the middle of my visit because she “needed space”. She’s said this multiple times yet...
- ...yet she constantly says “I don’t even know your bf, I never spend time with your bf!”. So which is it??? Every time in the last two years I’ve visited her I’ve stayed at there house, I’ve went out to eat with them dozens of times, I’ve been to numerous family events, a week long stay in the mountains with her whole dad’s side family. Is this not average,if not above-and-beyond? Is it crazy for a long distance bf to want to prioritize time with his gf? 
- Zero sense of boundaries: we stayed at her aunts house for a few days in summer. In the middle of the day unexpectedly she comes while I am swimming naked in the pool. They unexpectedly popped in about 8 more times that week. 
- No less than a dozen times (seriously) she’s said she wanted to move to my state. Ask her about it now? That was a lie and she’d never do that in a million years. She wants to die a block away from the house she was born in to spend time with cousins she only sees twice a year
- I earnestly believe the mom is the root cause of 98% of the discord in our relationship. And it’s not like I fight her back, or say *anything* to her face.
- You know how boomers annoyingly complain about kids being on social media all the time? It’s true in the case of my gf, she is literally addicted to Instagram and Snapchat 
- Her mom has wanted to know my salary and what I pay in student loans. 

Her mom is controlling her relationships. That’s not right. In the post I made a year and a half ago I said “she shows no signs of her mother’s traits at all”. It’s taken a complete 180. Yes, she’s still amazing with kids and all the other stuff I liked, etc, but the single biggest thing her mom does, saying she wants X then moments later reversing and saying she wants Y, is something I see a lot in my gf now.


**Recent events prompting this post**

*Pre-Visit*

The recent chain of events: last three visits in a row were flying to see me (thanksgiving break, after Christmas, and in March) because as I tried telling her, once she starts working in summer it will be difficult for her to take long periods off and far easier for me to visit her (working from home). Next planned visit perfectly coincided with her graduation and early summer: I’d fly out to her, we would go to a cabin in Gettysburg for my birthday, do half a week in Atlantic City to celebrate graduation, then after graduation day her mom got a free stay in a casino in Maryland for the weekend as her graduation present (ugh) and then we would fly back to my place together to spend a week. 

Maryland and my place never ended up happening. During this time my gf was applying to grad school, hoping to get into a one year program because she said she couldn’t afford two yr. It became a sort of tug of war between me and her mom: me encouraging grad school (even 2 yr programs) and her mom demanding she start working right away. Long story, well, it shouldn’t surprise you who she listened to. So what was once her mom yelling at my gf about not going to grad school became yelling about getting a job. 

Things take a new turn when two weeks before I were to leave, her mom goes through everything in her room: she read through *every* single private letter, note, picture, memento, anything (and there’s a lot) that my gf has from me. My gf smokes a good amount of weed and I sent her rolling papers (the very very legal kind you can get at any corner gas station). Her mom flips out, gf has to stay with friends for a few days. Her mom calls me, calls MY mom, and messages a police chief friend of hers (later says this never happened but I saw the screenshots and it looked legit) that I’m a drug dealer. 

At this point I’m not mad, I’m scared. The women who’s shown she consistently cries wolf now might try to get me in trouble for something that is a TOTAL fabrication? In her text to me she said I can forget about Maryland and staying at there house. So, for the weekend in between Gettysburg and Atlantic City I arrange to stay at my buddy’s house, and get my ticket to return right after her graduation, skipping the Maryland weekend.

The mom’s crocodile tears got my gf. EVERY day for two weeks prior to leaving every conversation would devolve into pouting “why can’t you come to Maryland”? We literally couldn’t even plan Gettysburg, Atlantic City, or graduation details because she refused to move on past Maryland. 
I tried explaining: with the INTENSE episode that’s happened the last few weeks, don’t you think a little space is a good thing? I have all summer, The rest of my life to spend time with them. Serious shit just went down and considering past history (not to mention how busy we will be with my birthday and your grad celebrating) it’s ok to skip this weekend- not to mention I already bought my ticket.

Then it became “why can’t you call my mom and apologize?” *She wanted me to call her parents and apologize because her parents went through her stuff and all my private mementos and accused me of heinous deeds*. I was in disbelief. But my gf was so, SO dead set. I relented and called them: the call lasted 90 seconds. I said *one sentence* (about how she dug through her daughters stuff), she flipped out, and hung up on me. 

My gf briefly sides with me then a day later is back to pouting, “why can’t you call my parents againnn?”
Long story short I did. We talked fine about nothing new (“we just want to get to know you more”, etc) and I explained how going off what she told me, I purchased my ticket to come back before the Maryland weekend.

*During the visit*

My gf still pouts until the day I leave. The first day we are together is wonderful as always, but then the fights start again. The first one on day 2 was small (me wanting to spend time at her place while her parents are gone) but then my birthday the next day another fight erupts. I was annoyed how the whole day she kept making quips like (I’m paraphrasing), “better do what you want on your birthday today because tomorrow is back to normal!”, contrast that to what I do for her, calling it a birthWEEK and try to make the whole week special for her. Sex the night of my birthday is a disaster, a huge fight erupts and I’m shaken to the core: it would be bad enough anytime but on my birthday? 

The next day she barely says a word until about 3pm; then things go back to normal for a couple days. The night we left I planned a beautiful sunset picnic overlooking the whole park, but her mom keeps badgering her via text the whole time, “why haven’t you left yet?!”. A girl in her mid-20s can’t make decisions on her own?

I spend the weekend at my friends, we have fun. Gf is at home and guess what- her mom is having another fit. I have her admit that had I stayed there, things would have just been worse.

The next few days in Atlantic City is relatively fine but at this point I’m not happy. I’m demoralized and disheartened. I was grumpy twice that I can remember, about little things. Twice we had to go to the bank that week to send her mom winnings (we don’t gamble but casinos have “free play” so of course we used it).

Graduation is fine, wonderful actually: I’m so, so proud of her. I make sure to get about 1,000 photos on my nice camera of her (her family just had cell phones.)

*Post-visit up to now*

Remember how after Maryland she was going to come visit me for a week before starting work? I wanted to prioritize spending time with her on my visit so I waited to plan her visit til I returned. Instead of seeing me around Memorial Day (when I had off, it worked out perfectly), her mom got her a room in Atlantic City (you have to gamble a lot to get comped rooms on a holiday weekend). Instead of seeing me on a perfect, free week, she did something she can do literally any weekend this summer. I was not happy. I told her how she’s going to be starting work and won’t have as much time to visit me, coupled with the fact for two years I have planned (and paid) for *every* trip.

I’m slightly more distant for a few days, but when she has to go to an MRI and turns out she has a litany of back problems, I’m there for her. She would text me in pain every morning, called me sobbing after her mri results two weeks ago.
She also starts her new job around Memorial Day; I figure between the intense back pain and the stress of the new job, she’s busy. We go days without phone talking, yet just a few weeks earlier I’d spend *hours* a day on the phone with her. I think something is off but she did say “I’m so busy I don’t even want to talk to my parents when I get home.” I know the feeling well so of course I just give her space.

I rarely use social media, I logged onto Instagram and noticed her newest picture and my heart sank. The guy she tried cheating with a year and half ago liked it. He now follows her and she follows him. 

I’m in shock. I call her and she keeps me waiting for 90 minutes before she calls back. I said how could you associate with him? You literally promised to me you wouldn’t? Her best friend was hooking up with a guy cheating on his gf for a year and allllllllll my gf did was bash it and talk about how morally repugnant it was...what was her reply now? “I don’t care”. She goes on to clarify that what she did a year and a half ago wasn’t “real” cheating but “emotional” cheating. I tell her that’s cosmo Snapchat story bullshit. 

And that when she started going into how she wanted to break up. It was an *exact* repeat of what happened a year and a half ago: huge fight ensures with her mom, she looks for attention from other guys and tries to break up.

She says the biggest issue is that I don’t want to spend time with her family. Second issue how she wants to live by her family. And third, the how much fighting we’ve been doing lately.

What I’m about to say is mean and unfair. I don’t like it, but I’m trying to be honest in this post: I’ve given her family more time and opportunities than *any* other guy would put up with. 

Second, I’ve told her multiple times: I don’t care where we live, but it’s ridiculous to plan your whole life just so you can stay around parents who treat you like shit (and like I’ve told her: your mom should be moving where *you* go!). As for her third point, yeah there have been a lot of fights...but don’t you realize 98% of them stem from/involve your mother in some way? 

I should add, my gf is a regular smoker and hasn’t smoked weed in about two months (even though she’s had her job for three weeks now, I feel like her mom still has her scared about it)

**So...**

I’m just sort of taken aback on every level. It feels like the same thing from a year and a half ago is happening all over again; and the thing that kills me is how GOOD and supportive I am to her. I swear I don’t mean it as hubris I’m just being honest: I’ve been there *every* step of the way with her, I’ve been her one steady, consistent rock; I’ve never had anything but her best interests in mind. It’s like...it’s the principle at this point: *you’re* trying to break up with *me*? Is this a joke?

Clearly I’m a fool for going along with this, but you have to understand there are about 10,000 little examples that gave me hope, that made me think maybe things would improve- and, for a while, seemed to be clear evidence it was, like all the times she said she wanted to move in with me. I feel like for many months it was headed that way, and all came crashing down recently.

So many of the posts I see here involve supportive significant others who know how bad the situation is...How can someone who has it so much worse than many of the stories I’ve read here (not that it’s a contest, just comparatively speaking) still defend everything her mom does and spurn all the times I’ve been her shoulder to cry on? Is my gf’s callous behavior coming from within or a product of all this maternal discord?

**TL;DR**: long list of examples of FMIL crazy behavior/ summary of current fighting between us going on the last month or two/ culminating in my gf talking to guy she cheated with and trying to end things. I feel like my gf’s cold and hurtful behavior has her mother at its roots.",JUSTNOMIL
"My mother was giving the wife and I a much needed break with our six month old last week. She’s a good grandma overall and loves our daughter to death. The problem is that she doesn’t always listen to us when we make specific requests (she had 5 kids and it’s hard for her to take direction). Normally it’s harmless stuff. But this time not so much. 

I picked up the baby on Thursday. Everything was okay until I brought her home. I left her with my wife in our bedroom and went out into the nursery to unpack her stuff. All of the sudden I hear my wife literally screaming. I run back (freaked out obviously). That’s when my wife shows me that a small piece of our baby finger (near the nail) was gone. I hadn’t even noticed when I picked her up. We called my mom who admitted she trimmed her nails with some scissors (which we have told her NOT to do and said that she is to use a baby nail clipper, which we provided, or file only). It looked pretty healed up but my wife insisted she needed to go to the pediatrician on Friday morning. I ended up taking that morning off work because I wanted to see for myself that all was well. As I thought, really wasn’t anything for the pediatrician to do. She just re-washed it and put on some petroleum jelly. We now just have to monitor how it heals.

The thing is that now my wife doesn’t want my mom babysitting anymore. (My mother has called me several times to check in but I haven’t relayed this to her yet because I’m hoping for a better solution). I completely understand how my wife feels and I’m not happy about this situation either. But I’m hoping to come up with some sort of middle ground (a) because I know my mom would never intentionally hurt my child and (b) having someone who loves her babysit for us is a huge help. 

Am I being unreasonable here? Is my wife overreacting? Am I underreacting? Thanks in advance for any advice.

**Edit: ~~I think my replies to people are being auto-removed. Not sure why. Maybe because I haven’t posted here before.~~ I think my replies now show up. Anyway, I appreciate the feedback. My mother is apologetic. She didn’t tell us about what happened because apparently she was scared of the reaction she’d get (which isn’t really an excuse).**

**Also, if my tone in this post suggested I don’t view this as a serious issue, please know that isn’t the case. This was a major screw up on my mom’s part. I want to come to a resolution that falls short of “you can never watch the kid again”. But I don’t think what happened is in any way acceptable either and I am not looking to brush this incident aside. Baby is also doing perfectly fine for those who are concerned. Shouldn’t even have a scar if we continue to attend to it.**",JUSTNOMIL
"(Trigger warning - Emotional abuse, parent death)


My mom passed away last year after a short battle with cancer. We had a complicated relationship with many twists and turns, and ups and downs. But when she passed away, I had come to terms with a lot of it, and I was devastated when she died. Nobody or nothing can ever prepare you for that level of loss, and the grief afterwards is crippling. My grief has evolved quite a bit over a period of 8 months, and I'm now reaching a stage of that grief where I am starting to feel anger and resentment towards my mom. I am now dredging up the past, and re-discovering things that I buried 15+ years ago. 

I have been married to my DW for several years, and we have one wonderful child together. My mom became a nightmare for us during pregnancy and childbirth. She harassed my DW to the point of tears on many occasions, and she was truly a JNMIL in that sense. She had perfected passive aggression, and she weaponized it against us, particularly against my DW. She made the birth of our child about her, and she nearly ruined the entire first two months of our DS' life with her manipulative tactics and DARVO'ing. I had many conversations with my mom over this period of time, and then the last straw was when she refused to call, text, or contact us in any way during our Christmas vacation (our DS' first Christmas). When I called her out, she went full DARVO. My dad got involved, and it ended with a two hour phone call with both my parents late on Christmas day. It was painful, frustrating, and ended with me telling my parents that my wife and child come before them, they are my priority, and that if they ever undermine my wife to me again, I would cut them out. Whether that message was received/understood or not...I will never know. The following two months were LC, and then we got her diagnosis. Seven months later, my mom was gone. 

My grief overwhelmed me for the next six months. I was unable to think about my mom without crying, and I was not able to conjure up anything but memories filled with love and happiness. It took six months for me to even be able to think about the bad things, the abuse towards my DW, and how I felt as a result. Now that I have talked through these things in one on one counseling, as well as couples counseling, I've also begun to dredge up past abuse that I suffered at the hands of my mom. 

I am now able to see that my mom was not only a JNMIL, but she was my JNMom as well. When I first had these feelings, I felt like it was somehow horrible of me to think of her in this way, since she was dead. How could I think of her in any capacity other than with love? The answer is simple, as I see it now. It is entirely possible to love and miss your parent, while at the same time being fully aware of their abuse. This is my reality, and will be for a long time. I have not reached the stage of forgiving her yet, but I know in time I will have to in order to move on. 

My mom was very, very controlling. All through my childhood and teen years, she controlled my environment in every way imaginable, and it was utterly suffocating for me, as well as my three siblings. Of all my siblings, I was the wild child. The rebel. The adventurous one. I could barely be contained! This kept my mom busy, and the focus off my other sibs for the most part. My mom saw it as her duty to keep me in line and on the path she thought was the right path, and she did everything in her power to achieve this goal. We were immersed in church from as far back as I can remember. We became hardcore Pentecostals, or ""holy rollers"" as they are sometimes called. For those who are familiar, you know exactly what sort of discipline and judgement is involved in this circle of Christians. 

I wasn't permitted to do anything without my moms say-so, and she had to know where I was at all times. There were strict rules, and if those rules were not followed to the letter, there were consequences. The belt, wooden spoon, or random objects used to hit me weren't even the worst part; the worst part was the emotional manipulation that followed. That's how she really kept us all in line. She was a victim, and we were the perps. She was the one sent to keep us children on the path to righteousness, no matter what the cost. 

It cost me a lot. I wasn't able to really live my teen years. Every impulse, desire, or worldly ambition was systematically thwarted by my mom. It's a long and painful story which I buried for quite some time, but has now come to the forefront as a result of my grief journey. I was 12 years old when I met my first love. Heck, we even met in church. You'd think that would be....acceptable in my moms eyes. Nope. This little girl was evil incarnate to my mom. She wanted me kept from her at all costs, and she didn't hide that fact from anyone. Because, of course, it was my moms job to protect me from those evil bitches who wanted to take advantage of me, right? My mom judged this girl because she was a foster child with horrid bio parents, and because she was mixed race (my family is Caucasian). 

The next five years were some of the toughest years of my life. Although there were times that she and I were deliriously happy and inseparable, there were equally difficult periods filled with heartbreak and turmoil. I fought tooth and nail to keep this girl in my life, and my mom fought with the same intensity to keep her out of my life. In the end, my mom won. She was the adult, the parent, the authority, so who else would have won, right? After years and years of harassment and abuse from my mom, this girl eventually gave up on me; on us; on our plan. My family moved away to another city when I turned 17, and I guess that was it for her, because she gave herself to someone else. It wasn't the end of us one hundred percent, but it was the beginning of the end. How could I ever reconcile that the girl I gave my heart and soul to had just given herself to some other guy? It wasn't in the cards for us. Especially since she got pregnant from the fling.

My mom couldn't hide her smug satisfaction at successfully protecting her baaaaaby from this evil woman. She even rubbed it in a couple times. I swear she almost said ""I told you so"". From the young age of 15, I didn't hug my mom, nor say ""I love you"" to her again for close to 15 years. I actually told her I hated her, and that she had taken something from me that I could never get back. I let that statement stand for 15 years without taking it back. In fact, I never took it back, despite telling my mom I loved her sometime around my 30th. She thought she had done right by me, protected me, spared me from something. She had stolen something from me; something that meant so much to me, and I have not forgiven her for that.

I wasn’t able to let her go until around the age of 26. I honestly can’t count how many times we attempted to find each other again, but each and every time, the hurt and resentment would creep in and drive us apart. She had made too many mistakes, and I simply couldn’t get past those mistakes. My mom had accomplished her mission. I spent most of my 20’s hung up on her, until one day I decided to find closure and let her go. I met up with her, we got everything out of our systems, and I said goodbye. It hurt for years after that, but eventually I found myself in a good place, and had my first real relationship outside of her. I let that relationship run its course, realized I didn’t want to be with that girl, and became happily single again for six months. It was then that I met the woman who is now my wife. 

The fact that my mom had alienated my first love, and essentially destroyed any chance of us being together, was enough in and of itself. But it didn’t end there. My mom also alienated my wife and tried to undermine our marriage. Nobody was good enough for her baaaaaaaby! I will never understand how a parent can see their suffocating control as doing right by their child. She undermined and stifled my love life to such an extent that I grew to hate her. I put away that hate in her last years somehow, and when we got her diagnosis, well, I simply forgot it for quite some time. But now it’s back and just as bitter as it was when I was 17. I am back there again, and I am miserable. 

I feel like I’m at a crossroads and I don’t know which way I’m supposed to go. Counselling seems to help for a day, and then the next morning I feel it all again. How do I forgive my mom and carry on without all the bitterness? She never once apologized for any of the abuse. I can only assume she thought she had done the right thing until the moment she passed away. If your child tells you they hate you, won’t hug you, and keeps you at a distance for 15 years, you’d think there would be some kind of internal reckoning or something. I guess not.",JUSTNOMIL
"For the back story [https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/bxcabc/my\_mother\_and\_my\_adult\_kids\_hair/](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/bxcabc/my_mother_and_my_adult_kids_hair/)

&amp;#x200B;

So, I finally calmed down enough (and prayed, and asked for advice) to call my mother and let her know that she had hurt my kids' feelings. It did not go as well as I had hoped.

She did not take it well. She had a response for everything I said - and the responses were not pretty. Let's make a list:

1) Mother felt that telling DD that she looked good in her new haircut would help DD feel better about herself with the whole ADHD diagnosis. No, Mother, she wanted to share it with you. DD does not need reassurances on her looks. 

2) Well, she just does not like DS's hair being fluffy.

3) Yes, she does visit GC's kids more, but they are younger. She used to visit us more when my kids were younger.

4) She goes with GC for Xmas, because I did not want her bringing GC nephew (NOT GC's son) with her. 

WTAH?!?!  What I had said (years ago) was that DH was not going to ignore his kids for a few days when GC Nephew visited. I know that GC Nephew's dad was not in the picture, but it was not for DH to ignore his own kids just to give GCN some male bonding time. 

So, of course that meant I did not want my mother at Xmas. She does not take GCN to GC's house because they do not get along,

5) Her feelings were hurt because at DD's graduation two years ago we took photos with family friends and I supposedly told her that we would take them later with her. Just checked. First photos of DD after graduation are my mother hugging her. 

6) GC and his wife are upset because I send BD cards to their family but I do not sign them. That is rude. I shot back that they did not remember DD's BD last year. The blow-up was my fault and they hurt her by focussing some of their anger on her. Mother said she has heard both sides and is not taking sides.

7) The kids do not contact her, especially DD. I begged the kids to send her a text once a week.

8) She does not know what to say when they talk with her about their interests. She feels more comfortable with GC's kids because GC calls her all of the time.

9) When I told her that DD feels that my mother does not love her because of DH's ethnicity, Mother's response was ""Where did she get such a STUPID idea?!?!""  I told her to NEVER talk about my daughter like that, that DD has the right to her feelings and emotions. 

10) Somehow the subject of my phone calls to her after my marriage came up. After DH and I married, I thought my relationship with Mother had improved and started calling her more often. Her response? ""Why are you calling so often?Are you and DH having marital problems?""

She claims she NEVER said that, that her mother never meddled in her children's marriages and Mother is following her footsteps. 

My emotions cannot take more of the reporting. 

DH says she is a master at throwing things back. DS and DD were listening to my side of the conversation, also, and have thanked me for standing up for them.

I am sad, almost at the point of tears. I really thought I had a better relationship with my mother. I do not.",JUSTNOMIL
"So, I  didn't realize how ""sensitive"" my MIL could be until two days before DH and I got married his brother was admitted to inpatient psychiatry.   After this happened my MIL would cry when anyone said anything she didn't like for at least two months.   There was a lot of woe is me, my life is so hard, etc.  She made everything far more about herself than BIL.
Fast forward almost a year to now. I am currently 5 months pregnant.   My MIL asked about making a blanket for the baby.   DH told his mom that would be nice,  and mentioned that someone else already gave us a baby blanket.  MIL started crying and when she could get words out said ""well I guess you don't need a blanket from me"".  There was no calming her down on the phone.   After 10 minutes or so DH ended the call.  Afterwards BIL received a call from MIL and FIL complaining about us, and how ungrateful we are.   Then a week later FIL phoned DH telling him to call his mother and tell her how much he wants her to make a baby blanket.   DH said "" no, I already tried telling her that I would like one and all she did was cry."" Typically DH phones his parents everyday during his commute home from  work.  He is currently in his fourth week of NC, because he is tired of hearing how his mother is ""sensitive "" and ""emotionally fragile "". I refuse to step into the middle of this I'm leaving it up to DH.
We have already had drama about when the baby arrives.   MIL was already upset that I did not want her coming to visit as soon as the baby was born because my mom will be coming to stay first.   I told her she is welcome to come and stay after my leaves (2 weeks tops). I think it's possible that this is what she is really upset about not some stupid blanket, but she would never tell us.",JUSTNOMIL
"My MIL has got some balls. Last Saturday or so, she texted DH about how she never gets to see him, the girls or me. He works Monday through Friday, and most Saturdays, half a day, but still exhausting. So our only days off together are Sundays. I've mentioned before that we think they have bed bugs, so them coming to sit on our couch is a big no no. We can meet up at a fast food restaurant or hang our outside really early before the sun gets really hot. 
 
So that day, she started messaging since the day before, but he wasn't replying. 1. He was taking care of both kiddos. 2. I was busy making his birthday cakes. 3. Facebook messenger doesn't really make noise, at least his doesn't. Or we just didn't notice. 

She started with ""when can we visit. I waited for your reply since yesterday. I wanted to wish you an early happy birthday and hug since I can't go on day of since I don't know what time you get out. It's also been a month since I saw Raseleane and the girls. How are the girls, you haven't uploaded photos on facebook.""

Well, DH told her that he's been really busy. He works a lot, and that it's only been 2 weeks since she last saw him and 3 weeks since they last saw kiddos and me. That Sunday is the only family time we get to spend together, alone. That if they wanted we could try and meet up at a fast food restaurant for lunch since he lets me sleep in. To not be so dramatic. That it's just really difficult meeting up with them, because of his schedule and theirs. They only like to come between 10am and 12pm because she works weird hours, and she doesn't like to go out because it's too hot and she's too tired. He also stated we don't like anyone coming to our place (we didn't say because we think they have bed bugs since we think that might be rude and she gets EASILY offended. [Example: she asked us to buy her a drink one time from McDonald's or some other place, asked us how much it was, and he said it was like $1 or $2 and she said oh so now your charging me for it.] We weren't, but he felt shitty even mentioning the fact that it costed that amount.) And he ended the really long paragraph with I'll send you pictures of the girls later.

Well, that was the wrong thing to say apparently. 

She replied ""Don't worry. I won't bother you anymore. Later, don't complain/say that your sister is the only important one."" 

Did she wish her son a happy birthday? Nope. 

But today, ""Can I have pictures of the girls? And I won't bother you anymore.""

I wanted to snap at her and tell her it's effing nice you were able to push past your anger to ask for a picture of MY daughters but you weren't able to wish your son an effing happy birthday. But I stopped myself. I also told him, she said she was gonna leave you alone last week not that she would leave you alone if you sent her pictures of our kids. 

I'm angry. I know it hurt him that they didn't wish him a happy birthday. They're always a disappointment in giving gifts to him. The nicest gift they gave him once was an anime pillow that they found at a flea market. Another year was some chick fil a. His sister got a rose gold watch one for a birthday. So yes, his sister has always been more important and he is super resentful. Shit, even for her birthday, he messaged her to wish her a happy birthday. He was sad that MY mom sung him happy birthday when she took him to work. At least his co-workers did too, but man, it's not the same. 

Am I overreacting? I feel so angry.",JUSTNOMIL

"First time poster.  I can’t even begin to explain my MIL’s unhealthy obsession with milk.  Background:  I’ve been with my DH for 17 years.  When we were first dating, MIL’s milk insanity was a running joke amongst our friends.  Anyway, as she’s gotten older, her obsession has only worsened.  If you open her fridge, there are—no joke—5-8 cartons of milk OPEN at the same time.  And you can’t trust the label because she mixes them all with whole milk and then will straight-face lie about what you are drinking.  Her most recent milk mania is that she will only consume milk out of cardboard cartons—NEVER from plastic.  She claims it gives her a “tummy ache” and that she can “taste the difference.”  Yet, she never asks if the milk is stored in cartons when we go out to eat, and she gulps it down just fine (yes, she is a grown adult who orders milk at restaurants).

Fast forward to a few months after my LO is born and I am returning to work.  MIL came to “help” with the baby while I was at work.  MIL brought her own milk to consume while at my house.  When it comes time for me to leave, I discussed LO’s feeding schedule.  I had pumped more than what LO needed for the day and had it ready in the fridge.  I told MIL that LO should take about 15-16 oz for the entire time I’m gone.  I come home to find that she had fed LO 20 oz. because “LO was just sooooooo hungry.”  Annoying, but fine.  We again discuss paced bottle feeding and the fact that daily recommendations for LO’s age is 30-36 oz.  I remind her that I am still nursing LO a lot at night and in the mornings, so LO doesn’t need to consume that much.  She tries to tell me that LO is “big” and needs as much milk as a 1 yo.  NOPE.

The next day, I wake up to find that—even though I already have LO’s milk prepared in the fridge—MIL went into my emergency freezer stash and dethawed 25 oz.  WTF woman, I just told you that 20 was too much, and so you dethaw 25 on top of the milk that’s already in the fridge?  MIL must think I can just sit all day and pump at work (she’s never held a job, so how would she know?).  So now I’ve got 40 ounces of milk in my fridge—most of which will likely go to waste.  I’m literally crying at this point.  After all that, I come home to find that she’d upped her game and fed LO 30 oz.  But I had to dig through the trash in order to figure that out, because, of course, she lied about it.  I was LIVID.  I took LO into my room and didn’t come out for the rest of the night.  DH tried to talk to her about it, but she started crying that I’m part of some grand conspiracy to prevent her from seeing her grandchildren and that she “doesn’t have much time left” (we have NO idea where that’s coming from—perhaps her rapture prophesies are returning, but that’s another story).

Final day of MIL watching LO.  I again set the ground rules.  She again boundary stomps and lies.  This time, she thinks she’s smart and tries to take out the trash before I can check.  I had to pry the bag out of her hands.  Shocker, she fed LO about the same as the day before.  She left that night.  I did not wish her safe travels.

It’s been two months and she still hasn’t apologized.  I’m currently at as minimal contact as possible (I want NC).  We are moving closer to her in a month (not for MIL’s sake, trust me), and I know she thinks that she is going to be allowed to babysit.  There is no way I’m letting her near my children unsupervised after the repeated boundary stomping, lies, and deception that occurred.  DH is pressuring me to relent, but I can’t let go.  I’m done.",JUSTNOMIL
"First time poster in this thread but active stalker of your posts! We are officially one year no contact with my MIL &amp; FIL. One year of birthdays, a Christmas, a third child born into our family, and a move. One year of peace. One year of stress free family gatherings. 
It feels amazing to have their negative, aggressive behavior out of our lives. It has made my marriage so much stronger and less stressful. But at the same time I can't help but feel bad for my husband. My family is actively involved and making memories with us whenever they can. I feel bad his family isn't in these memories for my children. But do they even know what they're missing? My husband stands by the NC no matter what and we have them so many chances to make it right before we cut the ties.

"My mom came in for a visit, they are rare or I would have no contacted her by now. She offers to watch my kiddo (6 yo) since school is out.  Alright only rules, 1. Stay away from BIL (he’s okay with hitting other people children) 2. Make sure my sis has her guns put up.  Before I was told the guns were never loaded in the house, but when I went to get kiddo this time, sis and her kid (10) bragged about how the guns are loaded and are kept that way because “bad guys won’t stop to let you load them”.  I’ve been to her house enough to know they don’t keep the guns in one spot(once I saw one on their kitchen sink), they don’t have a safe (we have offer to buy them one but get told nah we wouldn’t use it), and she was just telling us how a random child just walked into her house and was playing before it’s grandma came looking for it.  But I digress, Sis kid was asking me questions about my stance on guns so  I told sis kid “you shouldn’t be around them (loaded guns).” Got my kid and left.  When we were safely away I told them that my kid was not allowed in a home of unsecured loaded guns.  Next day all I get is one word text, I tried to setup some play time but they noped out.  Again the unsecured LOADED guns are the problem not them.  Mom decided she did want to see my kid so she came over Friday night, and bitched to me how it’s my fault that I didn’t “phrase” my concerns correctly and I was judgmental, because I answered a 10 yo honestly.  FUCK YOU. anyone who allows young children to have access to loaded guns is an IDIOT. How’s that for judgmental!  I don’t go to his school or daycare and say ,”please do not allow my 6yo to have access to loaded guns.”  It shouldn’t have to be said!  I know what this really was about, I told her fav that she was making a bad choice and we wouldn’t be around for it.  Oh and after Friday she left, I only have weekends off so a huge fuck you to me, and today I get a text “I miss my babies,” sorry but no, just fuck off.",JUSTNOMIL

Trigger Warning: Domestic Violence - No actual violence occurred, but very close for anyone sensitive.

My MIL has always been JY. I’ve never had any issues with her and love her to pieces. This is specific to this situation only. 

A couple of weeks ago my MIL emailed my husband detailing how FIL is al alcoholic. She says he is always drinking/drunk, has fallen down and broken ribs, drives drunk, etc. She also said he has gotten up in her face angry and yelling while drunk. While this isn’t domestic violence yet, it isn’t far from it. She says she has tried talking to him about it as has GMIL, but nothing has come of it. She says she hopes he gets arrested for DUI so she doesn’t have to deal with it. She says she is leaving him when she can (which could be a while because she has been a housewife her entire life so has nothing to fall back on). 

My husband and I live in Europe while they live in the US. Around this past Thanksgiving (before we knew all of this) we had suggested they come visit us over this upcoming Christmas holiday. Included in MIL’s recent emails was her saying she wasn’t going to come and visit because of everything going on. We understood and offered to pay for her to come out here by herself or with AIL fi she wanted.

Then, this weekend she emailed me and said to tell DH that she has decided to “forgive” FIL and that they want to come out for Christmas. Well, I read that and even before telling DH I said “I don’t feel comfortable having your dad in the house around the kids (DD/6 and DS/5).” He agreed 100% no argument at all and emailed his mom saying as much.

Well his mom called yesterday (after a short email saying how “cold” it was for him to say that) to discuss it. It wasn’t on speakerphone, but I heard the entire conversation (with DH permission, I wasn’t being sneaky). She tried to guilt him about it saying that FIL is his dad and DH is his only son (sn: that’s not true b/c DH has a half-brother that FIL adopted and/or raised from before DH was even born) and that she can’t tell him that, etc. She says she won’t come without him because it would be too awkward and she can’t believe he would even say anything like that.

She also goes on to say it isn’t that bad and if she tells FIL not to drink while they are there then he won’t. She says that FIL won’t get drunk around the kids and that she has “all the power” in this relationship. Which I think is crap because if that were true FIL would’ve already stopped drinking. Also, if he is the alcoholic she has alleged in her previous emails then I think (as an RN) that we would have to worry about DTs and withdrawal while here, which also isn’t fair.

Her final statement before DH abruptly ended the conversation was “doesn’t family mean anything to you?”

So, while my husband is very intelligent, he doesn’t think on his feet as well so he didn’t have any good responses at the time. We already talked it out and we still feel the same way. I already suggested that we sit and think it over and then write down what he wants to say in response to her guilt trips. I love him and have left it up to him how to respond. We are on the same page and he doesn’t throw me under the bus or anything. In fact, he didn’t even mention that “we” didn’t want him here but that HE didn’t. He is taking all the blame. I just wanted some advice on how to continue to support him as he deals with this. Like I said, she’s been great about everything so this is unchartered territory.  

TL;DR: FIL might be alcoholic, DH and I don’t want him in our house, MIL guilts us about that.",JUSTNOMIL
"TW: Mention of suicide.

Hello all, LTL, FTP, all that jazz. I'm in need of a bit of support? Guidance? Reassurance that DH and I aren't the assholes?

My mother in law has been an issue since my husband and I first started dating in high school. She hated how close we were and actively tried to sabotage our relationship by spreading rumors about me, giving out SO's phone number to ex girlfriends, going so far as to contact his first ex girlfriend in another state to try to get them back together, all because she hated me. 

Despite her best efforts, we stayed together, moved out of our abusive homes at an incredibly young age and got married right after high school before moving several hours away from both of our toxic families. She has continued to be a nuisance for the past sixteen years, I'll go into more of her shenanigans in later posts.

Last year, my husband and I had the opportunity to do a first for us and vacation in another country for our anniversary. The planning started about six months beforehand and first on the agenda was nailing down childcare for our two children, DS, who is now 11 and DD, who is now 5. We reached out to my mom first, who is mostly JUSTYES, but she was unable to take off work during the timeframe we needed, so we reached out to DH's mom next who had been on good behavior at the time we asked.

She was unsure if she would be able to take off, so we told her no worries and we would find another option. We ended up asking some friends to watch them, as they have children around the same age as ours and the mother is a SAHM. With that settled, we were a go on our anniversary trip. 

Two weeks before we are set to leave, we find out that the friend's mother's cancer had come back and they were taking care of her full time, in addition to caring for three children. They offered to still keep them if we had no other options, but that it would be best if we could find another alternative. 

We reached out to an old high school friend that we had reconnected with after finding out they lived near by, they also had kids close in age to ours and they mostly worked from home, they agreed and we were back on track.

We drop the kids off with them the night before as our flight was early morning and, while we were waiting to board our flight, I get a message from our friend. She had posted a picture of our kids together on the book of faces and received a text from MIL stating ""I guess you get DD? That baby begged to stay with me"" (never happened) then went on to state she had taken off work to watch the kids (she didn't), my DH had lied to her about who was watching our kids (nope, plans changed), that she had done nothing to be kept from the kids (not true, but that's another story), that we were ungrateful, that nothing she does is ever good enough, that she is ready to off herself, and that we asked friend specifically to hurt MIL. 

I told my DH to deal with his mother or I would and he messaged her immediately to deal with her. MIL messaged our friend back and said ""I wish this could have stayed between us"". 

Since then, we have been mostly NC. My DH asked her for space, which she absolutely would not give him, and then sent SFIL to guilt trip DH into getting back into contact. We have now changed our numbers as we don't want any further communication from her until if/when we decide we want to reach back out, but today she messaged my mother asking if we had changed our numbers, presumably, after trying to call DH. Again.

My mother did not give them out, but thinks we should reach out as she feels MIL is torn up inside. 

MIL has yet to apologize, only rug sweep stating that we all say things when we're hurt and that she has done nothing to deserve not seeing our children and was not in the wrong for dragging our friend in the middle, or for anything she said. 

Are we the assholes for not wanting to have a relationship with her anymore?


Edit: Shortly after this post, DH received an email from her therapist stating that her client is trying to reach her son and if this is the correct email, to contact the therapist. Is this normal?",JUSTNOMIL

"Advice always welcome!

If you know from my past posts, Margot and I have been at odds for little things, recently a Facebook post about my LO. She threatened to hurt herself, JNSM blamed me for everything, blah blah blah. 

Moving onto the story: Margot messages me late last night while I was asleep to let me know she loves me and LO (LO isn’t born yet, due Oct.8), and sent another text saying the same thing later this afternoon. Though I understand the excitement of being a grandma, her behavior seems to only be getting worse. 

She has pretty much treated me as a surrogate, acting and saying things to imply my baby is actually hers. Most recently, Margot bought a dresser for the baby’s nursery without asking, even after being told not to buy anything without permission in case we already bought it. Margot is still not listening to boundaries being set and I’m becoming more and more frustrated with her. 

I replied to her afternoon text by replying, “love you to mom.....,” to which she asked why I had put the dots. Then called me right after asking over text. Left a voicemail when I didn’t answer her call, and sent another text asking why I hadn’t answered. DH has just gotten home from working a double, so I was talking to him about LO and the situation with Margot. 

Margot is nosey, wanted to know what it was that was so important I couldn’t answer her call. I responded with the truth by telling her DH and I were discussing boundaries/rules we are going to be setting for LO once she is born. 
Oh, wrong choice of words there....

Margot begins in how she doesn’t want to fight, but my boundaries are going to cause conflict. When I say they shouldn’t if everyone just follows and respects what we say, she blew up! 

Margot starts by saying how I am being a nazi when it comes to my baby, and how it’s not actually my baby, it’s God’s baby. I’m just being allowed to carry her and mother her. What?! She continues by saying how she isn’t telling me how to raise LO and how she doesn’t want to mother another child. But turns around and said how my boundaries/rules are nonsense and “grandmother shouldn’t have to be grouped in with everyone else when it comes to them.” Everyone else includes my step mother, father and MiL. She doesn’t believe she should have to follow the rules we set, but they should have too. (????) 

Margot goes on to say how I was trying to start a fight with her, and how she can’t deal with the drama after her doctor tells her she can’t work (Margot has bipolar disorder, JNSM encouraged her doctor to say Margot can’t work anymore so they can apply for disability). She then says I am being a “selfish ass” for continuing to discuss setting boundaries and upsetting her. 

Am I being an ass by wanting to set boundaries for my LO, even before she is born? DH and I don’t see anything wrong, but obviously to JNSM and Margot, it’s a totally different story! 

I wanted to go NC with Margot, but I have a hard time because I do love her and want her apart of my life. But I also do not want to be walked over anymore, or for her to think I will allow her to dictate my life any further. Everything is about her and her disorder now, so any mention of me or my feelings is being inconsiderate to her because of her illness.

Edit: Wow, THANK YOU EVERYONE!! I am so grateful for all of the advice and insight I was given!

To clarify a few things, DH and I are not allowing any unsupervised visits with LO because of her behavior towards us since finding out I was pregnant. If we have an emergency where we wouldn’t take her, she would stay with my sister!
We are also installing cameras outside the home, in case she were to ever try and come by without permission. 

I, as suggested, gave DH the green light to take care of Margot how he sees fit. He has been biting his tongue for the sake of upsetting me or causing more drama. But he will be handling her from here on out! Big stress off me, and he has no problem taking on that responsibility. Plus, Margot will not longer be getting any information about LO! 

Thank you to everyone who has replied, and I apologize if I didn’t get back to you!!",JUSTNOMIL
"I haven't posted in awhile because things have luckily been quiet, I also haven't responded because things have also been quite busy!

With June being the month when most kids get out of school, we have some of DH's family from out of state here visiting for the next week. We had plans to visit them Wednesday night. They had an all day gathering at MIL's yesterday which I didn't attend. BIL2 &amp; SIL knew what was going on with her and I in the beginning (many many years ago, because she treated SIL the same way in the beginning, I think she changed when the kids came along and there was a threat to keep the kids from her). They haven't been let in on the recent happenings, just because I don't want to cause stress with them, it also feels a little juvenile having to make them change their plans so MIL and I don't see each other, even though there's so much more depth to it than that. I also feel weird telling my side, as it's something between the two of us, and while I know she's roasting me to everyone, I'm choosing to be the bigger person and letting everyone know, ""It's private and between MIL and I only, it would be unfair to say anything else"" -- all that in hopes they realize that what she is doing is wrong. 

So as mentioned before, we had made plans with said family to visit them at their inlaws a couple hours away later this week, as we'll be going out of town on Friday. Well, BIL2 casually let it slip when MIL asked what his plans were this week and DH tells me she all of a sudden cleared her plans for ""our evening"" to spend THE WHOLE DAY with them, even announcing it to his brother, that this would be instead of the following Saturday she initially planned on. DH told her she should stick with Saturday because we had plans before they even got here and won't be here Saturday and she said, ""we're family, it's not going to hurt anyone for all of us to visit together! "" So either (1) She's doing it on purpose so I can't see them, because she's realizing I haven't been giving in to her attempts... OR (2) she thinks I'll give in so I can see them? Pshh, I'm not soft. 

Honestly with how busy I'll be this week before we leave, I'll just chock it up to not having time if I have to, that'll be the excuse I'll tell myself so I don't feel bad about missing them.  I just hope that her past, present and future attempts to force a meeting and my refusal at all costs to attend will eventually cause her to stop trying so hard.",JUSTNOMIL
"I haven’t posted in awhile because there hadn’t been much to post.
My husband and I were working on our marriage, working on his problems (drug related) and in general doing a hell of a lot better than we had been. 

About half way through May, a CPS representative came to the house and said there have been claims that my husband had been driving the kids around high on meth and heroin. All lies. While my husband has been fighting his battle he’s been going to therapy and NA meetings and doing well.

So I let the caseworker in. I didn’t know that I didn’t have to let her in at all. I had nothing to hide, as far as I was concerned the allegations were false and this would be done and over with soon. Boy was I wrong. 

I did what they asked. I told the caseworker I had smoked a joint with a friend and it hadn’t been 30 days since then and I knew I would fail for the THC. I was completely honest. She said they weren’t looking for that so I took the drug test. 

My husband threw a fit and wouldn’t comply.
They had the results come back saying I had cocaine in my system. Completely false. I can’t do anything upper like, barely even caffeine because of my heart. I’ve NEVER done cocaine in my life.
We had a family meeting, basically they told me that they would be watching and I would have to take another drug test. Fine. I didn’t smoke again. 
So they came back and they drug tested me and my baby. They then come back two days later saying the baby had such a high concentration of cocaine in his system that he could stroke out at any time. So they removed the kids from my home and sent them to my husbands father and The Cuntful Elitist. And the baby was taken for urinalysis. 

He was tested 2 days in a row and both tests came back completely negative. 
I am not allowed to talk to my kids at all. My oldest daughter, 11, is completely traumatized. 4 and E are alright... sort of. 

We have another meeting tomorrow at 10:30. I need to know what to expect.

"Tw Suicide, not major but it is mentioned so just in case

Hi, these are about my grandmothers, which do fall under the ""mom"" umbrella in the rules. I'm sorry if I get something wrong, let me know and I'll fix it. 😊
Please bare with me here, thanks.
Okay so lets get nicknames out of the way. My mum's mother will be Oklahoma and and my fathers adoptive ""mother"" is Odessa. Lets hope that doesn't get to confusing.
So I struggle with mental health issues and have since I as about 7-8, thats when I noticed I was seriously depressed even suicidal, but before then I was a happy and got angry easily. I guess there were always signs i wasn't quite normal. But back then i was Oklahoma's favorite grandchild, because I was the only one. Makes it super easy, ya know?
But when my Middle Sister (MS) was born i suddenly wasn't anymore. And as I got older and older I started to see her for the complete narcissistic bitch she is. It certainly was no help to my ever growing mental illnesses and my struggles with gender and sexuality. But everything came to a head 4 or 5 years ago when I came out as Bisexual to Oklahoma, I thought she would love me no matter what, that she would be supportive because shes my grandmother and thats what their supposed to do. Lets just say I spent the rest of the visit in the bedroom i was staying in all by my self, MS was the only one talking to me, i fell just deeper into my hole of sadness and MS got taken shopping and to nice restaurants. We haven't been up there since because of how she treated me. Oklahoma seems to think she has some sort of right to have me, MS and BS (baby sister) up there for part of the summer.  
Odessa has never really liked me, even when i was tiny. She's your classic southern bigoted lady. Odessa never really liked my dad and the situation of his adoption is sad, frustrating and complicated. Its a mess. So I didn't start out with an fair chance of her liking me. Shes a pretty rich woman, much more than my family has. She owns two houses, pays for two others for her daughter, three cars and still has quite alot left over. But she almost never wants us around and basically has stopped telling us major family news.  
She can't get away with giving me nothing for X-mas and my birthday. So Odessa gives me crappy random shit, or an exact copy of what she gave my similarly aged cousin if I'm lucky. Oklahoma does also give me just bad things too while going all out for my siblings. Its awkwardly noticeable.
But I'm going to be moving out in a year, and I need to know how to handle all of this bullshit as an adult. Because all i have been doing is trying to get them to like me. But I've been getting treatment and I don't want to comprise myself for people who can't even do the minimum of acting like they care for me.",JUSTNOMIL
"My MIL and I have always had a rocky relationship. She’s well aware that I’m not particularly fond of her for a multitude of reasons. Throughout my relationship, the most frequent subject of the arguments has been the effect my MIL has had on my SO’s finances. 

My SO is a fantastic man, but he doesn’t quite understand how credit works or budgeting, or much of anything. I can’t entirely blame him, as his mother didn’t teach him much of anything aside from “credit cards are bad!” About a year into our relationship, he confided in me that he was being barraged by phone calls and letters from his student loan holder. He seemed to be under the impression that they were at fault, and when I asked him why, he explained that his mother insisted that she’d take care of his student loan payments for him. Every time he got a call or a letter, he would tell his mom, and she’d say “it’s coming out of my paycheck, just toss is!”

This had been going on for 6 years. I told him that if they had been consistently attempting contact for so long, there was obviously something wrong. Lo and behold, I finally convince him to call and... his mom never made a single payment on his loan for six years.  His interest and debt has now accrued to $10k for this loan. Even after all this, he refused to tell his mother because she’d only worry... needless to say, I was furious. 

Fast forward a couple years, she comes over for a social visit and tells us that she was going through her papers and found a couple letters from the IRS addressed to my SO... a letter from TWO years ago, claiming that there was an error on the return and that he owed $1,000. These letters were being sent to his old address, and she had been opening them, tossing them in with her papers to give to my SO, and then forgetting entirely. Finally my SO snapped and gave her an ear full, and this entire time, she couldn’t care less. She doesn’t even bat an eye. At the end of the conversation, she says she doesn’t understand why he’s so angry, and that he should just ignore it. In reference to the student loans, she said that she assumed the loans had been taken care of because nothing had ever been taken from her account. 

I know my SO isn’t entirely innocent in all of this, but my MIL’s complete nonchalance to the terrible financial situation she helped put us in makes me want to completely cut off contact with her. After pulling from our savings to cover the immediate fees from the IRS, and then the large payments, I am struggling to catch up. We have a baby, so money isn’t exactly abundant. Even still, every time my MIL comes over, she expects us to buy her dinners or help cover fees. I can hardly stand to look at the woman. I’ve urged my SO to have an actual in-depth conversation with her about how badly she has screwed us over, but he just brushes me off. 

At this point, I don’t know if I want advice or to just complain, but does anyone else have experience with something like this?",JUSTNOMIL
"I normally write about my JNMom, Toddel, named because she is an emotional Toddler and is a Facebook model. But I'm not here about her, I have some concerns about my MIL and because I have a messed up family I have no normal meter by which to judge her actions. I've been wanting to write about her for awhile but I'm not sure if any of the in-laws are on Reddit but after this weekend I decided to take a chance.

MIL has been, or appeared to be, super nice from the get go. DH and I moved really fast and she never questioned him on the speed of things, in fact she told him that sometimes you just know. When I first met her (and his sister1) she was very welcoming. At face value she's very nice, but there's just something there that has me on edge. 

Here's a few things she does that makes me nervous. She calls DH her baby or boy, like when we went to visit this weekend the first thing she said was, ""there's momma's baby."" Although it's normally boy not baby. She's said he's a momma's boy, which he is but not to a bad extent. He has a close relationship with her, but tells her no when he needs to and always puts me first. She ""borrows"" money from him frequently. Now she has fallen on hard times lately and she is trying to do better and he does have the money to help her but it is a significant amount of money. (DH and I have talked about this and have agreed that once he gets her bills caught up in a couple months he will stop giving her money.) And there seems to be this expectation for him to help her, even though he already pays for a couple of her bills.  On the other hand She doesn't argue with him when he says he doesn't have it. 

The thing that currently worries me the most is how she acts with her grandchild, my DN. She is always posting photos on Facebook without tagging the mother. If people write responses on there she'll reply to them but usually not my SILs. She calls him ""grandma's baby"" (she has a specific grandma name) ALL. THE. TIME. In fact almost exclusively. She does it so much so that DN will call himself that. Everyone else thinks it's cute but it bothers me. She constantly gives my SIL ""parenting advice"" i.e. don't do this or do that. SIL seems fine with it so  I feel like I'm over reacting. 

DH and I are trying for a LO in the sense that we aren't preventing it. I've raised my concerns with him and he thinks it's not a big deal or that I'm worrying about something that hasn't even happened yet and we'll handle it when it does. Am I right to be concerned? I've already told my JNParents that I don't like it and they agreed that it's their GRANDbaby not baby and they won't be doing it. Do y'all think there's red flags there? Should I be more on guard? Or am I over reacting because my own family is messed up? Is there a way to make DearH understand why this is important to me and why it's not okay? Any advice will be welcome. 

Oh and one more thing that happened this weekend that kind of bothered me, she was talking about something we got her for mother's day (DH idea, my effort) and she said ""the (present), that (DH) got me for mother's day."" She kind of stuttered over the DH part idk if it's because I was right there or if it's because she forgot my name. I think I may be over reacting here. 

TL;DR MIL calls DH momma's baby/boy. Borrows money all the time. Call her grandson ""grandma's baby"" so much that he sometimes calls himself that.",JUSTNOMIL
"A few months ago, I posted about my mother who I haven’t spoken to since October of 2018 because she told me and my wife that it was unacceptable to have my father at my table for thanksgiving. She said she was going to block me and my wife from fb.  

Then November of the same year I saw some messages posted about my brothers fiancée being pregnant and my mom saying if my wife says anything to her about being pregnant that she will kick my wife’s little ass.  Background to this story is that my wife two years earlier mentioned to my brothers fiancée that she shouldn’t be having a baby with my brother because he was cheating on her and racking up her credit cards.  Anyways, that was two years ago and my brother has changed since this.  So this added fuel to the fire and we haven’t spoken even more so because I felt she was immature to say these things about my wife without knowing the full story and even if she did know the full story and still said it, it’s immature of an almost 60 year old woman to talk like that
Fast forward to a couple of days ago:

My cousin gets in touch with me and she says I should try and call my mom because life is too short and my mom might be having surgery on her back.  My cousin even told me she didn’t want to get involved.  All this shit has been going on all my life with my mom.  The mental abuse, and now since I’ve been married she is trying to bring it into my marriage.  I told my cousin until my mom apologizes to my wife, I will not talk to her. 

Now today, I get a call a from my uncle.  He says he wants to go for coffee but only with me.  I told him I know what this is about and why can’t my wife come, he’s like oh because I just want to talk to you and I’m like yea I know but you want to discuss things about my wife without her being there.  I told him she’s my wife, and he’s like I’m your uncle.  I’m like whatever.  I told him I would call him back to possibly set up a coffee date.  
I really don’t feel like meeting up without my wife because all he is going to do is talk about how she is wrong when all she has ever tried to do is help my dysfunctional family.  Even my sister said when I got married to my wife how happy she was that I was out of this family. 

This isn’t good for my mental health and I just want it to go away.",JUSTNOMIL

TLDR on a few months ago;

Mom kicks us out and turns her back on an apparently suicidal 7 Y/O and let's a guy sexually assault her and my wife.


So it has been an odd few months since I posted that. A few things have changed, way more therapy has been involved, and the custody battle is progressing.

Well, my two SIL's have moved back in with my FIL. He's actually in progress on having a house constructed, and he's intending to move the younger son in with him as well. 

DCFS has come into the situation and required mandated therapy for my MiL and each of the kids individually. For some reason my MiL was able to decide who the kids went to (probably some insurance reason), and that will come up later.

The three older kids do their therapy, enjoy it, and feel better about themselves. It's not really a part of the story.

The therapist urged my MiL to contact each of her children and try to make peace with them. My wife decided to tentatively let her in. And just talk and grow in the relationship with her (as we are deciding to move out of state and want to leave in peace.)

My wife and SiL start talking about this therapist, and it turns out (according to my SiL) that she is one of those ""christian goodwill"" therapists, who believes that bonds with God cure any mental ailment. She says that she throws around the phrase ""just stop it"", and ""I don't believe you"" consistently, as well as interrupting her and being rude and short.

My wife is very much pro mental health and this just doesn't sit right with her. She talks with her therapist and asks my MiL to change my sister's therapist, because she seems unhappy about it. When youngest Sil gets told that she is switching therapist, she's very resistant with the ""awe, but I like ____."" and ""this is so unfair."" 

We're a little perturbed by this, because it's total whiplash to what we've been told before. My wife decides to just back out of these situations, let her sister vent to her, and that's it. My Mil has been pushing to get an apology and clear SAG (sexual assault guy)'s name, so he can move back in with her ""guilt free"".

Well, earlier this week my MiL calls my wife with a ""Eureka!"" tone in her voice. She says that the therapist has told her that my youngest sister is a pathological liar and was drastically altering a lot of situations to make it seem like she was abused. We're taken aback but not really surprised because of the changing the therapist thing. 

However, my MiL goes on to say the worst thing I've ever heard.

""Maybe what you thought was sexual abuse from SAG was actually just bipolar stuff.""

*edit; my wife has bipolar and this is what she was referring to*

I, for one, don't think a 250 lbs 40 y/o man cornering a woman in a closet is anywhere remotely similar to a manic phase.

I cannot believe she would try and blow it off like that. That's just absurd and stupid. 

My wife hung up the call and is going NC for a little while, to blow it over.

TLDR;

"Sorry for the wonky formatting. It’s finally happening. I’ve had enough of MIL and her passive aggressive ways. I’ll give a quick refresher unless you’d rather read my previous posts. MIL is my BEC, talks about me like I’m not in the room “OP can do this or that, just tell her”, she’s said she’ll post mean things about me on FB if I ever make her mad, she tries to get me to lie to DH, she’s playing favorites with my children, trying to guilt trip us into letting her come see baby when we aren’t ready for visitors yet. And so on and so on. Here’s my breaking point, although it’s a tiny straw, it broke the camels back. I haven’t spoken to MIL in around 3-4 weeks, almost 2 weeks ago our second daughter was born, preterm, she’s home and doing well, no NICU. DH told MIL that he’d let her know when she could come up, she continually asks despite being told she will know when we’re ready. Then she makes comments about her “first and only grandchild”. We have another daughter. So I said, that’s it she can wait longer to visit. Well after a couple more days of being ignored by both myself and DH, she takes to social media to throw a personal pitty party. Great. DH said he had to show me because he wouldn’t feel right keeping it from me. The posts range from “people make time for who they really love” to “don’t screw over someone who has been so nice to you”. HAHA. Well, maybe she should take her own advice and not screw over someone who has been nothing but nice considering all of the underhanded comments and passive aggressive behavior she’s thrown my way the last few years. I told DH I was done, he can keep the relationship civil between she and him if he so chooses but my children and myself were not going to be a part of her life anymore, she’s not running her fingers or mouth about me anymore and getting away with it. I allowed myself to be walked on for far too long and I’m not going to just lay here and take it anymore. I’m hormonal, I’m trying to adjust to a new normal, and I don’t have time for drama. Besides, I already told my JYMOM what she’s done. Anyone from the south knows there is no turning back once you tell your Mama! 

Just to throw this in there, DH is maintaining VL contact because he has quite a few valuables stored at her house while ours is being built and doesn’t want her to sell or destroy what is there. He also wants the house she currently lives in as it was his grandparents home. I’m not mad, I understand his perspective and respect it just as he does mine.",JUSTNOMIL
"Good Evening All,
(On mobile so excuse poor formatting)

Tl;DR: introducing myself and my long backstory with my FJNMil. 

I’m new to this sub and so glad I’ve found it! My mom has been a JNM but has turned to a JYM and I’m so proud of her for it! It took some hard boundary setting to make her see the light, but I’m glad she did. She has now fully embraced my DF (Dear Fiancé) and that makes my heart so happy to know and see. I always hoped DF’s mom would see the light, but that’s not the case at all.

There isn’t one episode in particular that makes her a JNMil it’s just her overall personality. I guess I’ll start at the beginning, so hang in here we go!

JNMIL and FFIL split almost 15 years ago and she still can’t stand the sight of him to the point that she for years tried to keep her grown some from seeing his dad. DF had to lie constantly about being in contact with his dad and if a friend went with him to visit his dad they couldn’t post anything on FB or they had to block the post from her so she didn’t lose her mind and call him cussing at him for seeing his dad. He even had his dad listed as an alias in his phone so she wouldn’t know if he was calling. Let me just say DF’s dad is the most amazing, kind, sweet man there is. He’s incredibly proud of his son and supports him and encourages his completely in everything he does. So she doesn’t have a leg to stand on in her behind juvenile attitude towards him. It’s so bad we’ve had to seat them at tables completely across the reception from one another in our seating plan and DF has had a frank discussion that she will not cause a scene or she will be asked to leave. 

To the next point, because she’s an excellent manipulator she tried to manipulate DF into being a quasi stand in partner to her. She needed frequent texts from him throughout the day and phone calls often as well as seeing him at least once or twice a week with him taking her out to dinner and giving her money when she wanted it. He even had to finance her new car when her old one broke down (she will be refinancing before the wedding so he’s not tangled up in that anymore). If he didn’t comply and answer the texts, phone calls etc once she did get a hold of him she would lose her ever loving mind on him. Basically she’s the victim and a hateful woman. So much that she’s lost most of her closest friends due to her horribly toxic attitude. If she wasn’t the center of my DF’s world she just could not handle it.

Here’s where I come in. I met DF at a tough time for the family (his sister had passed about two years previously, his niece was in JNMil’s care, long story, and they were all adjusting). I see some unhealthy family dynamics but figure it’s a grieving family trying to put their lives back together and decide to wait and see how it all worked out. Once I started to learn more red flags started going off all around me. At first it seemed JNMIL liked me well enough, but I’m assuming that’s because she assumes I won’t rock the boat with her being grossly attached to her son as his previous gf’s had not. About 6 months in I had a very frank and somewhat heated discussion with him and it started to open his eyes to how horrid she was, he even admitted he knew a lot of it was wrong but it had been easier than fighting her.

I’ll just fast forward through a lot of bullshit and hard work on my DF’s side he’s put in healthy boundaries with JNMIL and she’s on a basic info diet. He did tell her he would be having a relationship with his dad, he wouldn’t hide it and if she had anything negative to say about FFIL she could keep it to herself (once she found out he was seeing his dad she used to sign off phone calls with, “well tell your dad fuck you”). There is a lot of back and forth with her trying to stomp on those boundaries when she doesn’t feel she gets enough attention, but so far DF has kept his boundaries. I’m blissfully no contact after she’s repeatedly tried to start drama with me and I told DF that I would never keep him from his mom, but there was no reason for her and I to be friends or involved in one another’s lives. I went though a lot of therapy after my first marriage ended and leaned I don’t have to accept toxic people in my life and I hold to that steadfastly. Once he realized how toxic his mom was he stopped even mentioning it.

Well now we are building our first home and getting married in fall 2020, and I’m sure there will be more drama as she refuses to ask about either big event for us and only mentions me in passive aggressive was that I took her son and am a drama starter. There are so many stories I could tell, but I’m sure there will be more as my life with my love progresses!

Thanks for reading!",JUSTNOMIL
"My flair may be premature but I’m celebrating my little victory.  I’m happy and I know that she can’t tear (Darling)H and I down.  If none of this makes sense, sorry.  I’m happy ranting after all of the crap that woman put me through, I just feel relieved.

We are 3 weeks post wedding and the Diavolo Italiano (Italian devil) and I are NC for the foreseeable future.  All good updates and a couple tales from my wedding day.

I previously posted about my now husband being in the fog.  He’s emerging.  He has now gone to VLC and is open to the info diet.  DI pried his eyes wide open on our wedding day.

She showed up (late) wearing next to black.  She legitimately mourned our wedding from the front pew in church.  She sat in a corner at the reception with her vile boyfriend with the most terrible CBF I have ever seen.  My parents hosted the wedding at our family home.  They made every detail perfect from the landscaper to the caterer and footed a fairly hefty bill.  Everyone complimented them and their home except lovely DI who couldn’t even speak to them let alone look them in the eye.  She, however, did allow guests to believe the she was responsible for the extravagant soirée.  

She still had the audacity to fake niceties to my face and demand that I call her mom.  As if I’d invite the diavolo herself to be a mother figure to me.   This was after I overheard her call me hefty to a friend of hers.  My neighbor who doesn’t know a thing about DI and I’s issues asked why she acting the way she was.  She was finally transparent and now everyone knows.

At first I was infuriated by her behavior.  After a freak out, I went neutral.  My husband finally saw the hurt she caused me and opened his eyes.  She wants to pretend her family is perfect while still covertly treating me poorly.  The thing is, I have a perfectly imperfect family already who adore me and my husband.  My husband’s extended family have seen her stripes so now we don’t have to worry about being exiled from them.  I don’t need to give her anything of myself unless I want to.  And for now I don’t want to.  I want to stay happily no contact.  

My husband graduates this week.  Thankfully there are multiple ceremonies so I don’t have to go with his family.  My amazing mother offered to go support him because she’s proud of him (sorry for the JUSTyesMom brag). We are slowly financially untangling him from her and soon we’ll be free.

I just can’t get over the feeling.  I have the man of my dreams and I will not let her ruin this for us.",JUSTNOMIL
"So I hired my younger brother to do some work in my backyard that involves digging a trench and laying concrete.  My husband and another friend who works in construction will be helping.  This work starts in a week and apparently my parents have told my brother that it’s going to be extremely hard work and my mom in particular is trying to convince him not to come.  

My brother just broke up with his girlfriend of 5 years and she kicked him out so he has to stay with my parents temporarily and I feel like they baby him and are overly involved in his life.  

My mom in particular pisses me off in this scenario because she is telling my brother he shouldn’t come and that it’s gonna be too hard for him.  He is a 32 year old man who is extremely in shape.  I used to work in construction as a supervisor for similar types of work and know he is more than capable and have told him that.  My mom just sees him as a baby and thinks he’s gonna get a boo boo and doesn’t want him leaving the nest for more than two seconds.  

It also annoys me because my parents know our house flooded due to drainage issues and can’t afford professionals to come in because we have a baby on the way so we are trying to do this ourselves before the baby comes.  I just feel disrespected like they don’t even give a shit about my situation and that we have done all this coordinating to plan the work out and get it scheduled.

"So after a few months of relatively blissful silence the Red Rocket has dog dicked her way back onto my radar.

Anyway. She’s been gone a few months and i haven’t heard from her since. She’s been busy nagging my husband for pictures and desperate for replies from him. Joke’s on her though because he is awful at replying to messages, especially when they are from her. He doesn’t respond well to old cows telling him what to do. But of a problem with authority, gee I wonder why.

I have a few other posts about stuff that she’s done lately, but here’s why I need advice:

She’s started contacting my family. She sent a message to my JYMom asking to meet in the town between theirs for lunch. It is a 45 minute drive and in the next state but that’s nothing for our people. My mom, being my mom, didn’t respond until she asked what we wanted her to do.  We initially said yes but she is still hesitant to jump in because she has her own life to run and she knows the situation makes me anxious.

However it’s a bit like dangling the promise of a wild and crazy new flavor of nut to a squirrel. We’re all curious. 

Bit of background: MiL earned name Red Rocket after she accused our dog of raping our child, has emotionally/financially/mentally abused both of us in the past, stole $12k from my kids",JUSTNOMIL
"Advice is, obviously, always welcome.

There’s some background to the main story and I’m long winded, so pop your popcorn BEFORE embarking on this journey. Also, please keep hands and feet inside the throne at all times.

Growing up I described myself as an excitable introvert. I was shy and painfully awkward with new people. With people I was comfortable with I was loud and enthusiastic, but I was terrified of being the center of attention or with a group (or even single person!) I didn’t know. As I grew up I also grew a shell. I (very unfortunately) would often come off as cold with new people. My small talk skills were absolutely abysmal. Like, criiiiiiiinge.

Now I can make small talk fairly well, and my shyness isn’t as painful in new situations, and I work hard to not appear cold or aloof. But people absolutely drain me. Even people I like zap my energy and I have to be alone (or just quiet and only with LO and/or DH) to recharge.

Anyway, I met DH when I still struggled with appearing cold. He, however, is fantastic at bringing me out of my shell and putting me at ease. When I met his family, though, I realized he didn’t get that from LOT.

LOT is exactly the type of human being that makes me shut. down. So when I’d try to, say, answer a fucking question? I’d get cut off. I know, silly me thinking a question requires an answer. If I’d try to make small talk she’d take over. LOT dominates all conversations, is always correct, and doesn’t seem to care if anyone else is participating in her “chats”. I’ve said before, I’m not sure I’ve ever finished a single sentence around her. She is exhausting.

I tried so hard, guys. So so goddamn hard. I really wanted them to like me. I hugged them even when I was uncomfortable. I listened to LOT and remembered things and asked about her life. I kept a smile on my face, even if sometimes it was my work smile. I rugswept, I brushed off BEC stuff because everyone is different, 

One day I was driving with DH (BF at the time), and he asked me to call LOT. I forget why. But I called her, and it went to voicemail. As I told DH that she hadn’t answered, his phone starts ringing. He picks it up, it’s LOT asking “I saw you guys called me!”

Uhm... well okay then. That to me was weird.

The next time I had occasion to call her, it went to voicemail again. I was in a pickle so I hung up and was trying to decide who to call for help next when my phone rings. It’s LOT! Awesome!

Me: “Hey, LOT, thanks for—“

LOT: “WHO IS THIS.”

Me: ”....................... Enthusiastic.”

LOT: “oh. I don’t have your number saved.”

Me: “....................... okay.”

I told DH. He told me she just didn’t know how to work her phone. I called bullshit because, get this y’all, ITS HER WORK PHONE. IE UNKNOWN NUMBERS WOULD MOST LIKELY BE CUSTOMERS.

I called her another day, post marriage. I kid you not, same. Mother. Fucking. Conversation. Except that time she answered, so it was straight to “who is this” in the NASTIEST tone possible. After that was the Great Birthday Blowup where she made sure we knew that of COURSE she didn’t have my number, she only has FAMILY in her phone!

Now, please remember that BIL called me a bitch for not wanting him in my bedroom, then ignored me for a year. BIL refused to speak to me. In... I don’t goddamn know, solidarity? LOT decided that if it was me, LOT and BIL in a room at any point in time, they would ignore that I existed completely. Anything I said or did was ignored. I ended up shutting down, curled up as small as possible on the couch playing on my phone. My shutting down when completely and totally ignored and isolated led to her telling my husband how rude and disrespectful I was. Now, for the record, this wasn’t a one off and then I just ignored her every time I went over. Every time I went I greeted BIL, I desperately tried to make small talk, and every time DH went outside with FIL they’d turn into catty high school girls and act like I was a ghost. And then I’d go hide. But damn was I rude about being ignored and talked about and treated like gum under their shoes.

In a last ditch effort at a relationship I went over to see her twice alone. The first time, she informed me that I was responsible for solving the problem with me and BIL because DH and BIL were soooooo close. She told me no one had done anything wrong and we just needed to move past it. That the “boys” obviously missed each other and I needed to make it right. That I needed to go up to BIL and say “BIL, let’s just start over!”. Uhm, no. He owes me an apology to this day. “Hello, BIL, how are you today?” was as hard as I was willing to hit and frankly that was pretty damn generous of me. The other time she told me that DH and I needed to include BIL in the planning of a party we were throwing. At our home. He was invited. When I said that he was invited she told me I needed to make sure he “felt included”.  This is an adult man. And again, inviting him to my home was so fucking generous already. Fun fact, BIL didn’t even attend the party so I don’t know what to tell you.

Any time she and I have been alone she has made it as uncomfortable as possible. How much she loooooved DH’s ex? Check. Reprimanding me like a child for “fighting with BIL”? Check. Pot shots at my appearance? Check. Making fun of my laugh? Check. Weirdly repeating how haaaaandsome DH is? Check.

So now we don’t go to their house. I don’t want them at mine. They don’t see our child or receive pictures, from me or DH. And to be fair, they don’t text or call or invite or ask for pictures or anything. Every once in a while they send DH a snotty text like “so are you ever going to talk to us again”, but those just piss DH off.

But I don’t reach out. Sometimes I feel guilty. Sometimes it’s so damn hard because I think about how sad DH is or how devastated JYM would be if this had happened with my SILs. And sometimes when I read stories on here I feel so guilty, I don’t try to make it work. I don’t call, or text, or go over, or invite LOT out to lunch. I don’t send pictures. And honestly I never have. After her repeatedly acting like she doesn’t have my number and being horribly rude to me every chance she got, I’ve never been like “oh let’s go out” or made any other real effort at a relationship. I tried to get to know her in her space and almost immediately realized she hated me and that wasn’t fun for me. And while I was polite and tried sooooo hard when we went over, and planned our “family” get togethers and reminded DH to call and set things up, I stopped reaching out fairly quickly. And sometimes I feel like a bitch.

But then I think about my JYM. And how she and DH have dates. How she tells him she’s her favorite son she didn’t give birth to. How she will drop EVERYTHING for him. How she treats my SILs like the most beautiful, wonderful, amazing women in the world. How she treats her kids with respect. How she follows our rules and boundaries. How issues are cleared up with a quick talk. How every single relationship where she hasn’t liked our SO or our friends she has been pleasant and happy and included them. JYM loves her kids more than she dislikes anyone. Is she perfect? No. But she tries and she loves and respects us and treats us like adults, and what more can you ask for.

I don’t know, guys. I’m feeling guilty and down. I know I shouldn’t. But I haven’t seen any of them in over 6 months and it’s just weighing on me right now. Part of me feels like if I were a good person I’d call and try to set up a time to see them. The rest of me is like “they can’t make any effort, they don’t reach out, they’re rude and disrespectful, and I’m so much happier away from them”.

I’ve always said anger is a secondary emotion. And now that it’s gone, I’m realizing it was my response to grief. This isn’t what I wanted and I’m grieving the family my LO could have had and never will. And then there’s fear. I haven’t seen them in over 6 months. I don’t know if they’ll ever reach out, but I know if they do they’ll want to rugsweep and hug me and hold my kid. I don’t want to hug them or play happy family,

To end no contact so I can freely see my sisters with out sneaking around which is too much for a high school senior and freshman.  It's too much for a woman who cheated on her husband who works over 100 hours a week to support her spending. Too much for a woman who literally locked herself in her room with a stranger from California having loud sex that all her kids had down out on their own.

She took her boyfriend out on a shopping spree with her husband's money to celebrate his birthday but couldn't even text or call me to say happy birthday. It's not even about the material items, I just wanted my mom to say happy birthday. 

I hate that she uprooted my support system for her own selfishness. My husband works out of town, i have almost no close friends to lean on and now no family too?

It just hurts. I miss my mom, I miss my family being so close and all i want to do is apologize for somethinh I didn't do to have it all go back to how it was before.",JUSTNOMIL
"This is my first time posting and I'm really nervous about it.  This situation took place over memorial day weekend and I'm trying to decide if I should confront or let it go.  I was so mad/hurt in the moment that I walked away and gave the cold shoulder.  

For backstory, I have three medical conditions that aren't a secret to anyone.  I have hypermobile Ehlers Danlos Syndrome which affects the musculoskeletal system pretty extensively and it's gotten worse since I've been in my 20s (28 specifically).  It is classified as a disability and is a chronic, genetic illness with no cure.  I have OCD, severe growing up and mild to moderate now.  And I'm in recovery for an eating disorder and have been doing really well for about 6 months.  And she knows about all these things. 

I'm having a procedure this upcoming Tuesday for the EDS to try and improve some of the symptoms.  She asked me about the procedure and what it would do on memorial day.  I explained, it was all fine.  She knows about my condition because my husband had to tell her to stop cornering me at family holidays to ask when I'm going to be pregnant.  

Later on, I walk outside.  It's hot so I'm wearing shorts and sandals, but I also have two flesh toned ankle compression braces that are doctor ordered.  I specifically got flesh toned ones to not be majorly eye catching.  

GMIL looks me up and down and goes ""what's going on with your ankles"".  I tense up a bit and tell her it's just more of the same.  She replies telling me ""you're a hot freaking mess.  You need to get this stuff under control.  What are you going to do when you're old? Have you tried maybe exercising or watching what you eat?""

She had to have seen my face turn to stone.  Firstly, I'm not overweight, I'm a 5'8 and a size 10/12 in American sizes.  I'm very active (fitness is recommended for my condition so I do aerial acrobatics, pole fitness, and yoga).  Not that it truly matters.  She knows I do these activities and asks me about them.  But to question someone with a genetic medical condition and who's recovering from an eating disorder is especially hurtful.  For reference, my SIL (husband's step-sis) is very overweight/obese and GMIL has made snarky comments to her as well and asked inappropriate questions.  I've been irrationally petrified of that throughout my life and recovery.  She cares very much about appearances and she was very much subtly suggesting weight loss based on her own ideals.  

Her implying that I'm being ""lazy about curing myself"" etc and if I'm doing enough is deeply hurtful to me.  There is no cure for any of it.  Only management.  And I think I'm doing all I can and doing really well, all things considered.  Her judgement hurts a lot.  

My husband was in utter disbelief that she said that.  He also asked why I didn't stand up to her.  But it was the beginning of the cookout and I was afraid of causing drama.  Thankfully, my husband supports me and backs me up but he wants me to assert myself with her so she knows my boundaries.  

My question is: do I confront her about her ableist behavior or let it go?  What do I say/do, etc?  Her comments were very triggering to my eating disorder and I stayed inside for the majority of the cookout because I felt uncomfortable and judged.  I thought it was common knowledge not to mention someone's food who has an eating disorder.  And I'm working through being able to handle these setbacks but I guess I'm not fully there yet.  

Tl;dr: GMIL shamed me for having a medical condition and implied I haven't done enough to ""cure"" myself causing anger for the ableist comments and triggering eating disorder symptoms for the weight comments.",JUSTNOMIL
"So me and FDH have already decided in getting a place of our own. He agreed to move in to my city since he's been looking to change jobs and I need to get a place near my college. This would all be great and that....

&amp;#x200B;

But FMIL already knows about that. This wouldn't be a problem since she's always trying to kick him out of the house but as we all know they like to have their kids close by, otherwise, there's no one to hear their rants or for them to unleash their anger on.

FDH made the ""mistake"" of metioning we'd be moving in together around September during a family dinner.  FMIL proceeded to tell FDH's aunts and relatives that ""She's sure moving in won't be a problem for me, but it will for FDH"" and that ""she doubts FDH is ever gonna be serious in a relationship"". I honestly don't know what to feel about that but in part it seems like she's making the rest of his family believe I'm the one pressuring him to move out or something of the like.

&amp;#x200B;

I've wanted to got VLC with her but I'm having an hard time telling FDH about that. I asked him if he'd like our parents to know our address when we move out and he said he doubts his mom would even drive that far from home. Sure, she relies on him to drive her around or long distances but if he moves out she'll have to eventually come over because FDH won't be there to drive FBIL around. So my fear is that if she does know where we live that she'll insist on visiting and most likely to start yelling and ranting about stuff and nitpicking about the house or how we'll keep it. (even more scared because we might have to share a house with other people).

How should I bring this up to FDH? Honestly my only problem is with FMIL and a bit with FBIL, I adore the rest of his family (at least the ones I got to know so far).",JUSTNOMIL
"TW for alcoholism 


Alright, so, I’m f*cking pissed right now. 

Some background, my Dad and Stepmom are usually very JustYes people, but they’re also alcoholics. That’s the problem tonight. 

They like to go to the beach every summer, and since we aren’t too far off their usual route, they like to come spend a couple days with us first to visit with the grand babies. I have no problems with this, in fact, I love it. They’re cool people, it gives us a chance to do all the touristy things our city has to offer that we would normally never do, and they usually help a lot with the kids, so we get a bit of a break. 

My husband, God bless him, got up early this morning to clean the entire house before they got here. He also took care of our 2.5 year old and our 4 month old while letting me sleep in (seriously y’all, my guy is freaking amazing. I’m blessed). This included a deep clean of the entire bathroom and washing the rugs. Our house isn’t anything fancy, but it looked damn good by the time he finished. He was so proud lol. 

Anyways, we went out to eat tonight and both of them had 3 beers each. NBD, they’re on vacay right? Well, back at our house this lady drinks 3 Mike’s Margaritas and a whole 1.5L bottle of red wine. This is a normal nights worth for her. It’s also “normal” for her to puke 3-4 times a day. Well, she ended up puking right before they went to bed tonight, and it got EVERYWHERE. I don’t just mean a few drops on the floor, I mean the toilet, floor, both rugs, the tub, and the trash can. To make it worse, she “cleaned up” by throwing the rugs into my special laundry basket. (A side note: I have a slight obsession with a certain fashion brand. It’s not cheap, but I’ve acquired a pretty good collection over the years. The basket probably held about $600 worth of clothes. Yeah.) Then she put the whole basket, puke rugs and expensive clothes, in the garage and LEFT IT THERE. They went to bed! So I walked into the garage and saw (and smelled) the puke seeping into my clothes. Y’all I about passed out. I came back in the house cussing like no Christian woman should lol. Then my dear, sweet husband reached into the puke basket and grabbed out all my clothes and threw them in the washer (with my careful instruction on the proper way to wash them). Then he went to the bathroom. And it was his turn to cuss. They left the puke. All over the bathroom. So there my husband was, at midnight, on his hands and knees bleaching our bathroom for the second time in 24 hours. 

As I said, they are both usually JustYes, but tonight was a definite JustNo night, and there’s really nothing we can do about it. We’ve tried to talk to them about their drinking, but they just don’t care. So, here I am, venting to you lovely people at 1 in the morning. Now I need to go to bed; we have church in the morning and I need to pray for my sanity.",JUSTNOMIL
"Flair says No advice wanted, but im ok with advice, though this is an oldie. A few years ago, DH and I attended his relative's wedding. We traveled a long way to it, and us and his cousin were the only ones who made the trip. We hung out with cousin and their SO a few times before the wedding itself, and the wedding party was kinda a late night, so we were looking forward to having a lazy day together the day after, just the two of us.

During the wedding, one of the family mentioned going to a baseball game the next day. It being my MILs family, nothing was said very directly, more of a ""a few of us are thinking of going to game"", and we were never specifically asked about going along, or given any real info. We never committed to anything, and it was mentioned to me and DH separately. Im not from this country, and it turns out they were going to an afternoon game and not an evening one (I had no clue afternoon ones were a thing, and I guess incorrectly assumed that people would reach out and make firmer plans the following day for an evening activity).

Day after the wedding I actually felt kinda sick, I had a wisdom tooth issue that was becoming frequent, and had slept terribly with the pain. DHs phone had died because his charger needed a plug adaptor and he didnt realize the connection was loose, or that he had a dead phone. I also decided I'd go for a nap once my painkillers kicked in, as I was so tired from the pain. Suddenly, my phone blew up and woke me. It was my MOM, several thousand miles away in hometown, sounding very worried.

Apparently MIL had called her because her relatives had met for the game and we obviously never showed because we didnt know it was an afternoon thing. They couldnt contact DH because of his phone issue, so called MIL, who was also in hometown. For some reason MIL decided this was a huge emergency and we MUST be in trouble, so she involved my poor mother, for reasons I will never understand.

Bear in mind this was shortly before my own wedding, and she definitely had my number, so could have just called me herself. I had zero calls from anyone. If she had my moms number she must have mine!!! She could have also easily given my number to whichever relative rang her and gotten them to call me, instead of ramping up the drama to a million by inserting herself and triangulating like crazy. There was literally no need to call my mom, she gave her a real fright because she phrased it as ""OP and DH can't be contacted, waaaah waaaah waaaah, have you heard from them?"" (why? what does that have to do with anything? mom thought we might have been mugged or in an accident)

And she made a huge deal of it afterwards about how it was awful of us to say we'd go to this goddam game and never show up, despite the fact that we never committed to anything AND since i was unwell I would have likely noped out anyway. Mom said that her tone was super judgy too, probably cos she was ""embarrassed"" that we had somehow let her down by not attending something that we literally just learned of a few hours earlier and might not have wanted to go to anyway, as we were adults on our own vacation and not obligated to go to something like that anyway. It was nice that relatives were arranging stuff, but we had been in town for a few days already, they never reached out beforehand about it, we were in a very touristy city and could easily have booked something else, AND they never phrased it as something concrete or told us they had tickets or mentioned a time/place to meet if we did want to go. It was more of a casual thing anyway. but go MIL making a minor communication thing into a humungous international emergency and portraying us as incompetent children.",JUSTNOMIL
"She’s in her early 60s and in fine health. 
I’m not married to her son. 
I’m VLC and she knows she’s blocked on my phone because I can’t stand her. 

Consider all of those things and then picture this woman, in town for a visit, standing over me in my home while I am typing on my laptop taking care of business emails. 

“When your mother is at the age she needs taking care of, and you’ve made all of the arrangements, she’ll listen to everything you say.”

I look up at her and ask, “are you being sarcastic? What are you talking about? We’ve been over this. I am not making ‘arrangements’ for my mother. She bought long term care insurance.”

“No but you would do it. And she’ll listen to you.”

(She knows zero about my relationship with my mom. She also talks very confidently about the relationship I have with my dad, who died twenty years ago.)

“I don’t know what you’re talking about because I already told you MY MOTHER DOESNT BELIEVE IN BURDENING HER KIDS WITH CHANGING HER ADULT DIAPERS WHEN SHES SENILE. IVE ALREADY TOLD YOU.”

“Well your son will do it for you.”

“NO HE WILL NOT BECAUSE I TAKE AFTER MY MOTHER.”

“Well a son who love his mother will take her in and do what she needs.”

“A mother who loves her son and has the means will not expect that of him.”

“Well... I know... but....”

"A few weeks ago my boyfriend's mom made a late breakfast for family that was in town. I was helping her and started the potatoes in her cast iron pan. These were those frozen bagged precubed potatoes and I've seen her make them in this pan before, hence why I used it. Well she says ""do you want me to finish those?"" I step aside and let her do her thing.

Later during cleanup I hear her say to her own MIL (sweetest lady, I love her) ""Yeah I really don't use this pan much for potatoes because they stick"" um they probably stuck because they need a little oil and to properly crisp before you start turning.

Well she invited us for dinner tonight (breakfast for dinner) and what did she cook the potatoes in? The damn cast iron pan! 

 Honestly for the most part I don't like her cooking. I'm a bit of a snob since my own mother is a chef and always fed us fresh veggies/food made from scratch. My MIL however uses frozen and canned veggies which is fine but she steams or cooks it to mush.

If anyone else wants to rant about their MIL's cooking I'd love to read it.",JUSTNOMIL
"
Good Evening guys, I am looking for some advice, 

This is about my mil, we are Iranian and just for clarification this is not norm in how I grew up or how my cousins and friends did it’s not our culture however it would be nice to hear from others in a similar culture if this is a new thing that’s starting in our generation?

My maternal grandmother was Naneh Joon &amp;&amp; my Paternal was Bibi Joon.

But 

So for some while now my mil has been calling herself mama to my dd. Her daughters children all call her mama, apparently the eldest picked it up from mil children while mil was providing childcare daily and nobody stopped it, mil encouraged it so their mum is “mummy” and grandma is “mama”

I wasn’t actually aware of this until few months ago, as sil lives in another country but visits once every two months for a few days, and her youngest children only started talking 6 months ago. But she has been “mama” to sil eldest for around 9 years now and obviously the two youngest (3,2) have copied their elder brother.

So when she was calling herself mama I was taken back! I did confront her straight away and she just smiled and said “okay, well I’m sure dd will choose whatever name she feels fit to call me” so I thought , phew that wasn’t too bad. 
However the next visit every other word coming out her mouth was mama, my husband told me to stay quiet but now my dd has just turned one,  he did tell his mum to quit it. She didn’t take it kindly, we went through all the names she should be expected to called, but she just sat there crying that she’s “mama”

Dh stayed firm in his words and now she doesn’t call herself mama anymore however yesterday sil was here for her bi monthly visit and mil as soon as dh left the room was like “KIDS LETS TEACH the baby EVERYONES NAMES” and she had the kids chanting mama a million times to her, I thought hmm this must be so my dd hears them and learns who “she is”

My sister in law pulled me to the side quietly and said she thinks I’m being unreasonable for not going along with her children and that I’m being difficult ?

But I just don’t like it, I’ll be honest, I think it’s because when we visit she try’s to be play mummy. And combined with “oh my daughter” it’s too much, and when sil went for an errand, I heard her refer to herself to sil children not just as mama! But mummy and mum aswell”. Sil dd said to her “no you’re mama, mummy’s gone shops” and she goes “ohhh my dear daughter, it means the same thing!”
So she is trying to blur the lines? And I worry because she may FaceTime them everyday but she sees us like twice a week!

Actually tonight she kept referring to herself as naneh joon which is what my dh wants her to be called. But when she went into the other room where there was a big mirror I kept hearing her chanting dds name and then chanting mama joon then my dd started crying and ran into where I was sitting and started going “mamaa” to me (win for me lol) and mil had a proper face on her, and when dh said “why was you saying mama joon so many times when you went to get dd out of the room next door?” And she literally lied and said oh no I didn’t. We just rolled our eyes and left anyway. 


Am I being unreasonable for not going along with sil children? Or am I in my own right? And what tips can I do to make sure dd (dear daughter) doesn’t copy her uncles? As they constantly call me by my first name around her and my dd has started recently calling ME mama.

I can’t believe this is even an issue!
And it’s not cultural because I’m from the culture! But maybe it’s a new thing happening?",JUSTNOMIL
"So I understand this is a MIL thread, and my fiancee has posted about this before (see thread ON THE WARPATH) 

So while overseas visiting my now fiancee we got engaged, immediately was thrown out, while on the other side of the world (literally, MD to AUS) and my mother went NC with me. When I got home I had to have my local police stand by with me while I retrieved my belongings and have since found a place with some friends. 

This has been an ongoing trend with my mother, she has multiple psychological issues and is addicted to prescription medications following a 2012 car accident. I feel bad cutting her out since I know it's not her and it's the drugs and issues talking, but at the same time for my own sanity I cant stand being around her or talking to her because she is constantly gaslighting and being emotionally manipulative/blackmailing. All she cares about is money and has actually wished I died/was severley injured in a plane crash while returning from Australia so I could ""think about my actions"". 

I have been less stressed without her but that has since been replaced by other issues, notably money and personal finances. But I am handling those better than I am her.

My question is, what should I do in terms of leaving one form of communication open? I have her ignored on all social media so I can see if she messages me but she cant see if I saw them. I have a new phone number and new address she doesnt know about and am getting a new job since she has shown up to my place of employment and caused scenes there. 

Any advice?",JUSTNOMIL
"Nothing too serious but this weekend I went to a consignment shop with my JNMIL and she found a corset with chains and suggested I get it because my husband would like it.

She then said maybe then we would give her grand babies - we don't vwant kids (I already have a daughter and she is enough and I love her with my entire soul). 

She also once posted a on facebook wishing a - her exact words - happy birthday to her daughter who married her son (she often refers to me as her daughter, not DIL)......like wtf this isn't Alabama. Both me and my husband had to explain to ger how awful that sounded.

"[In my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/btwf2c/spoke_to_nanna80sf_after_entire_family_went_nc/), I mentioned that my Nanna had been diagnosed with Dementia and that my Parents had ""borrowed"" in excess of $100,000 from her over a 10 year period. They ""borrowed"" this substantial amount of money through lies, threats and deceit. My Nanna has been a widow for over 10 years now, and preying upon her for money is grossly inappropriate.

But the main reason why I'm posting is because I finally had Lunch with my Nanna today! 😍😍😍😍  
My Fiancé and I drove over to hers. We picked her up and bought her back to our place. We cooked up lunch and ate birthday cake (Nanna, my Fiancé and my Daughter all have their birthdays in June). It was honestly so lovely and enjoyable! I couldn't stop hugging her, telling her how sorry I am about everything and that I love her.

&amp;#x200B;

Then when we started cleaning up, Nanna said something that my nMum had said.

A few months ago, my Mum had told my Nanna that my Fiancé doesn't talk to his Mother. At all. As in, he has ""apparently"" cut his Mother out of his life....completely.

My jaw dropped and I immediately turned around and called my Fiancé into the kitchen. I reiterated what Nanna had said to me. He laughed at this ridiculous notion and rolled his eyes. We legit see his Mum once a week, and this has been an ongoing thing for almost 3 years now. Both he and his Mum have a good relationship, and it's always been this way.

Mum has started a smear campaign against my Fiancé. Mum is making it out that **my Fiancé** is the ""problem"", not her.

"So, I have a rather complicated relationship with my mom. There are times where she has helped me through tough times, and times where she has said and done hurtful things and then apologized for making me sad (not for her actions - just for making me sad).

However, one of the things that to this day still upsets me is that my mother seems to think that when, sometime in the future, I have children, I will not be able to take care of the child (I am in my mid-twenties for reference). This has come up at multiple different occasions within the last year, for example:

&amp;#x200B;

1. While discussing something completely different, my mother states that she would be very worried if I got pregnant (I am in a long-term relationship? And financially stable? What?) and that if my little sister got pregnant, she would be completely calm (well, my sister is really great with kids, but I'm not too shabby either)  

2. While talking about my sister's and my future, she stated that my sister would probably have 2, maybe 3 kids, and I would at max. have 1 because kids are hard to look after (I mean, I know they are, but damn it, they are also wonderful little creatures at times. And she knows I've always wanted a big family). I got upset and said that I felt that I was just as competent as my sister in terms of the ability to raise children. My mom then retracted and said that she didn't think so just because of me, but also because she thinks my SO is lazy (he's not, just absent-minded like me). Gee, thanks, mom.  

3. While talking about my worries about future children and disease (I have a chronic illness that a hypothetical child has a 10% chance of inheriting), she told me that if I have a child, she and my dad will take care of it as much as possible. I think it was meant as support, but it sent a chill down my spine, and once again made me feel like she doubts my ability to look after children (that, may I add, I don't even have yet!)

  
I feel like the best course of action would be to not include her in these things. I haven't, yet, as in the past she has been someone I have been able to really depend on. However, statements like these feel like a punch in the gut and make me feel like I will be a terrible mother when I have children, and I want to protect myself from that kind of stuff. So, if any of you have some advice/some phrases I can practice for these situations/anything you may find helpful, I would really appreciate it &lt;3",JUSTNOMIL
"Still newish, and on mobile lol, apologies. Advice isn't really needed at this time, but please feel free to comment or reply.

[And thank you for all your replies on my first post!]

So when I spoke to y'all on here, I mentioned that I was reluctant to go LC/NC on Trauma Vampire (my JNM, thanks for the name) at first due to several reasons, but most of all lonlieness.  But after thinking on what y'all said, I decided that I just wouldn't call her. Then all of a sudden a whole week had gone by, with no calls/messages. If I wasn't so stressed out about my impending homelessness (Its okay, not the first time.) and lack of work, it may have been a very peaceful week. 

I called my step-dad (greatest dad ever) about something and he mentioned a problem that had come up that had required a serious amount of money immediately, that they didn't really have. Trauma Vampire had not mentioned this to me, but it definitely explains (doesn't excuse) why she was so spiteful before. I called her to check on her and we spoke briefly, but not because of an intentional info diet. Both of us just had nothing new to talk about. My situation hasn't changed and she just relocated, so it was probably the shortest conversation we've ever had.

I'm really glad that I took y'alls advice about LC/NC. The break I've gotten has taken a weight off me in a time where I am already carrying too much without it. Like I said previously, she has come a very long way from our former toxic mother-daughter relationship through my childhood. But she still has her moments, so I know this won't be my last post.

I've been told on multiple occasions I need to write a book on the things that have happened to me lol. I am great storyteller when the mood strikes. So if anyone is interested in some old (usually humorous) Trauma Vampire stories, let me know. I also have a few about my JN(ALMOST)MIL, that are just head scratchers.

"Apparently my SIL has been complaining to JYFIL (her father) that she wants “both families to spend more time together” and he NEEDS to invite TSM and her family to the weekly dinner we have with JYGMIL. Apparently not every week, but that “we NEED to invite them out more”.  No one is willing to have a conversation with SIL about TSM regularly excluding us from her family events (SIL is almost 19, I’m pretty sure she can handle a grown up conversation about this). My DH says if FIL and GMIL want to invite TSM and her family then we shouldn’t bring up the issue to SIL. 

DH and his father’s side of the family are from an Asian country and they are very old school when it comes to certain things. GMIL is the head of the household and if she doesn’t want something discussed it doesn’t get discussed, if she wants the family to do something it gets done. Nothing has ever been unreasonable, but GMIL doesn’t like to “rock the boat” when it comes to TSM, simply because TSM holds so much influence over SIL.  GMIL is okay with extending an invite for holidays, birthdays and an occasional dinner in between, and doesn’t want anyone to bring up TSM’s exclusion of us to SIL. I am willing to respect that, so please no advice on bringing that issue up to SIL (I just needed to get it off my chest).

Topics I am looking for advice on, since we might be seeing TSM and her relatives Father’s Day :

1. Grey rocking about DH and I planning on trying to start a family soon (I will be seeing my doctor this week to discuss getting off medication so we can start trying to get pregnant this year). FIL dropped the ball and told TSM about us trying soon earlier this year so cat is out of the bag on that one. I normally drink a glass of wine at dinner, and especially so if TSM is there. If my doctor has me go off my medication I plan on stopping drinking except for date nights with DH, or birthday celebrations with friends (until I actually become pregnant, then stopping all together). How can I grey rock any questions or comments about me not drinking, or about if we are trying yet? I want TSM and her family on info diet and honestly just don’t want HER knowing anything. She hasn’t earned that right, in my opinion. Some of her family, like SGMIL, are okay, but if they know something they will tell TSM.

2. If someone brings up that we never attend TSM’s family events how can I respond without making the other family members’ seem guilty for not inviting us? I also don’t want to say anything harsh about TSM that could be overheard by SIL, or get back to her.  I’m not sure TSM’s family members know that they can contact us and extend invites, I think it’s been put on TSM to contact us and she just drops the ball or perhaps doesn’t want us there.  I wouldn’t mind being more in contact with some of TSM’s family, there is a cousin that DH us to be really close with and would love be to again. I too enjoy this cousin’s company, and he’s been nothing but amazing to me.

3. How to keep DH from being in a conversation alone with TSM without seeming like I’m hovering or purposefully always there. Check my post history about SIL’s graduation for the story behind the last time they had a one-on-one conversation. I also don’t want to be in a conversation alone with her, so maybe ideas on how I can bring that conversation up with DH?

&amp;#x200B;

So, my mother is not *always* a JustNo, but she is sometimes and it's really confusing for me. I live with her still because she's my legal guardian despite the fact that I'm in my early 20s due to mental issues. Gonna be honest, I'm really unsure if I even belong here because while my mom wasn't always the best, I could always handle her at her worst.

Onto why I'm posting. My mother has the worst habit of shutting down conversations that she no longer cares for. Just like, mid-sentence, if she doesn't find it interesting anymore, she either leaves abruptly or she tells me to leave her alone. Normally I used to just do what she's asked but I've been talking to others about this and they tell me it's not normal to end conversations like this.

Example being today, we were having a discussion just a little bit ago. It was me, my mom, and my older sister. We were just talking mundane things and our plans for tomorrow and dinner and things like that and then, in the middle of my conversation she tells me and my sister to just leave her alone, she was going to sleep and had a headache. This became a big thing because my sister and I's dinner plans were revolving around her and what she wanted. Her shutting us down has effectively put us in a place where there's a chance that we might have to skip dinner and she knows that. 

And I know that I can talk a lot, I'm a rambler when I get started, but we had only been talking for at most ten minutes and half of that was her playing on her computer, ignoring us because I had asked my sister what she had planned for dinner tomorrow since she was planning on cooking for us all. My sister stated that she was going out to the store for some things and was talking about what time was going to be good for her tomorrow and things like that - basically, my sister asking if either one of us wanted to come with while not saying so because heaven help you if you ask ""do you want to go to the store?"" or ""hey can you go to the store?"" to my mother, it was always ""well I can't go out, I've got allergies, I've got asthma, I just got injured, blah, blah, blah.""

(side note: she's *always* injured, she's never not injured. I tripped over my dog and fell to the ground, getting hurt in the process and the next day, I wake up and ""she's got a swollen leg, can't get out of bed, can I make her coffee and ask Older Sister if she can run to the store to get cigarettes for her?"" When I went to check her leg - because I'm the resident doctor \[but am not really a doctor in the slightest\] in my family since we never go to the hospital if we can avoid it, she started yelling at me about it so I just backed off and helped her despite being in pain myself). 

Anyways. When, during the argument that happened between my older sister and my mom, my mom said that she had felt ignored throughout the entire conversation and she didn't see why we needed her input, I told her that it was ridiculous that she felt ignored given that *she* was ignoring *us* for half of it. This did not help and I regret saying it. She started screeching at me. How could I blame her for being bored when the conversation didn't include her, I was a horrible child, I was being disrespectful, I was being a whole lotta words I don't like typing out. I eventually just said ""Okay, fine, but we're not trying to blame for you feeling ignored, we tried to include you and we were all talking, you decided that the game you were playing was far more interesting than the conversation and that's not on me."" and left. 

Again, it didn't help. Now, she's gone out for a walk and when she comes back, she's going to act like none of it ever happened and everything is fine. And I don't want to, but at the same time, I'm just so unsure if I'm just being too sensitive about this. Am I being childish? Was it wrong to continue the conversation after she had gone on the computer? Should we have just ended the conversation and continued it alone elsewhere? Am I in the wrong here or is Mom?

Mobile edit: I want to thank you all, sorry for the late replies, I didn't get into bed until three cause my older sister went and got us fast food and I spent the rest of the time between the fight and sleeping binging Nextflix cartoons to feel better.",JUSTNOMIL
"She's done it occasionally before but yesterday it was too much.

My mom is a typical JNMOM (abuse, neglect, etc. I won't get into it here) and I told MIL this before I realized that she literally has no filter and anything I tell her I'm telling 8 other people minimum.

Yesterday MIL and me were making candy for DDs birthday. It's fine. We can stand her in small doses these days and it's usually worth it to see DWs siblings. MIL was already being irritating (check my post history on r/ftm) and then she goes ""I know DDs other grandma isn't the best so I try to be a good one"" out of the blue. Like I was just silently molding these candies (she was humming bc she literally does not know how to not be making noise) and she blurts this out. Like. You don't get to just randomly bring up my abuser who you've never fucking met to make yourself feel good by comparison! Sorry! And you were a shit mom to DW anyway! Fuck you! Of course when someone pulls such bizarrely inappropriate shit like this I don't know what to do so I just kind of nodded but wtf.

AND the other day we were over for dinner. We (DW MIL SILs and I) had been talking and there was a slight lull in the conversation. I'm fine with that because I don't have to always be talking, and so was everyone else except MIL.

She has this line that I fucking hate to try to make you talk to her when you just don't want to. She says it to anyone she wants to drain the words out of, like we're in a video game and she's trying to exhaust the dialog options, as DW says. It drives us nuts. 

""So OP, tell me something."" ENTERTAIN ME! YOU MUST BE SINGING AND DANCING AT ALL TIMES IN MY PRESENCE!

I was in the middle of taking a drink so I draw it out just a bit. ""If I had something to say, I'd say it"" is all I say. That's not even really confrontational, and honestly I did a good job because I fucking hate being forced to talk when I don't want to. (I was a shy kid. This happened a lot.)

""Oh OP, that makes me so SAD!"" and she laughed. 

Like sorry I'm not a windup toy??? DW that sweet sweet woman just patted my hand and rolled her eyes before changing the subject.",JUSTNOMIL
" 

Hello All,

I just had weird interaction with mum and i am so not sure about this interaction, it feels so weird and i cannot put my finger on exactly why it bothers me.

Backstory: Brother and his Partner are expecting, the little one has not come yet, is due (a week over due now).

Mum came up to me a few months ago and said she had a dream that she wanted me to remember and recall for when the time comes, it was a dream that she was holding her grandson, and other people were coming to take him for some reason and she was insisting that he was put in her care and she had to take care of him, and she was fighting trying to keep the baby with her and stop these people from taking him.

This Morning:

I go to make a coffee and comment to mum that partner said she was going to evict the little one now because he has not made an appearance yet, she then decided to remind me about this dream and started talking about other things in this dream, which were things that she did not say originally, i said i was so confused about this and said this isn't what she said originally. She then started to talk down to me, saying things like oh there there this must be so confusing for you.

I ended up walking away to sit down and have my coffee in front of my computer and read this subreddit and she came in after a minute and started going in about this dream again and saying stuff that was not part of her original dream and then she was like oh there there your poor little brain can't handle it. I told her to watch herself and to remember i am autistic, she sort of backed off but kept up with the passive aggressiveness. She eventually left me alone, i went back to reading this subreddit and then 5 minutes later came back and said she reflected and realised what she said was not correct and she was confusing another dream that she never told me about and the one she did and she was sorry, i said that is fine but i was more shocked at her condescending me over a dream. She straightened up stopped talking for 5 seconds as if she was in thought about what i had said and then began talking like normal about how she just confused the two dreams and then left.

I just don't know what to think about all this.... it is so weird...

I am not going to tell my brother or his partner about these because they are so weird and upsetting, i didn't tell them about it originally because they don't need that nonsense.",JUSTNOMIL
"After her uninvitedly weeping, crying and yelling in our kitchen DFH has tightened the reigns on FMIL. He's told her she'll have no advisatory role in his life and she's to accept contact on his terms if she wants to continue being in his life. Except her congratulating me with my engagement to HER son there hasn't been any contact. She's banned from our house for the forseeable future and life has been good.   


Except with our getting married in the autumn I can't cut her out completely. I'm very much done with this woman and her leeching victim mentality but my DFH deserves as good a relationship he can get with his mother. And at this point that involves making nice and making sure she doesn't CBF her way through our wedding. I'm pretty sure that with DFH's shiny spine she won't do anything outrageous but after five years every word out of her mouth triggers me.   


So my plea to you dear readers; Help me make this bearable? Tell me, how do you do it? Is there a way to distance yourself? Maybe make the situation funny even!",JUSTNOMIL
"Xposted in r/inlaws
My in laws -
They are a depressed pod of people who have anxiety self medicate with alcohol. They are not derelicts and have smarts and success but they only seem truly happy when drinking when talking about themselves and their “amazing children.”
I sometimes do not enjoy their company because as a group they are downers and If SIL isn’t happy, nobody is happy. Especially MIL.

I have the most resentment towards her. She has unhealthy attachment to her daughter (sil) and her family. When our families are all together she cannot get two feet from a member of SIL’s family. For example she stayed glued at hip to her daughter and little grandson at our wedding. She hardly engaged with my family at all. It was extra insulting because we had a family-only destination wedding. She behaved as she just there to drink wine and nanny. 

She left her husband to follow her daughter and husband in order help out when they had their first child. She has nothing else in her life but her job. She has no friends, no other family (aside from us) or hobbies.
She prides herself on being indispensable to them. She favors them and I think feels truly ill when she is not near them. We live away so when she visits us 90 percent of her conversation topics are about them along with incessantly comparing our children to theirs. I believe she has an obsession.

This never really bothered me until we had children. I thought that her attachment was based on her love for her grand children. I thought that our children would garner the same love. I was wrong. We have since had three of them (one more than SIL) - much younger than theirs and in group gatherings it’s almost like she goes out of her way to ignore us while clinging to her daughter and her family. We have politely asked her for a hand with our children on occasion she responded with a very reluctant “..OK” like we demanded that she go clean her room. 

Then she will book a weekend visit the next week to come “spend time” with us. Her spending time with us consists of greeting our girls, throwing little gifts at them then sitting and getting drunk with my husband (then being hungover with my husband the next day.) This is an whole other issue all together. They behave more like a couple than mother and son. But for now, my husband thinks his mother and family are amazing and loves being with them. They are only amazing to him. They ignore me and show little respect for me and my children. I think they are arrogant people. 

Luckily we don’t spend holidays together. Sil hosts every holiday and grandparent birthdays -we only attend the milestone birthdays and the occasional NYE. Sometimes SIL and family will do a quick visit here to grace us with their presence on their way to and from something else. Of course mil is always with them 
I have no interest in any more group trips but husband loves his family and our children like their cousins so I know it can’t be avoided for long. 
This has been a bugaboo for almost 10  years. It’s not going anywhere. The worst part about it is that my husband and I will get in viscous fights over this. He will cuss me out and tell I’m the one with the problem and he hates me for having issues with his family. 

Her (and the other IL’s behavior) isn’t necessarily egregious or super inappropriate  but it is shitty and I can give many examples.  But for now, just looking for other’s experience with this. Advice or insight.",JUSTNOMIL
"Trigger Warning -  Talk about rapee and Cosby

So this is from when my oldest (now 6) was around a year and a half.

We have always supported my daughter's right to say no. Starting at around 3 months I noticed she would use body language. Someone would reach to take her from me and she would return her body away and more into me. Usually this would be ignored and so Inwould have to also turn my body and say ""she is saying no""
This did not go over well with Sneaky Susan and her GC (DH'snoldest brother).

Anyway, when DD was old enough to start saying no I had to remind Sneaky Susuan, who tried to force OD (Oldest Daughter) to hug FIL. ""No means no Susan. We are going to respect that. It's her body""

Then I caught Sneaky Susan trying to manipulate OD with guilt (who the fuck does that to such a little person!?!) ""Oh but look how sad Papa is.""

I was in the other room but I came in and said ""I heard that, and no means no. That means we are not going to try and guilt another answer from her, but you may ask again later. I expect you both to respond to her no the exact same way we would expect her 16yo boyfriend/girlfriend to respond to her no. That way if her no is met with anything less than respect she knows the problem is them because she has been saying no her whole life without issue.""

Months later the Cosby assaults were starting to come out. I heard FIL ""pfft. Why wouldn't they just say no?""

""Maybe they had family who wouldn't accept no for an answer and so they grew up uncomfortable with the word and too afraid to say it."" Topic quickly changed.

All no's from my children are respected from DH's family now..sometimes I have to remind GC's children but I shut that shit down.

They probably talk shit behind my back, but they would do that anyway so oh well.",JUSTNOMIL
"Basically what the title says.

How do I know this? She just drove past my house, in broad daylight. I called my lawyer and he said that there's nothing they can do about her driving down the road (I do live in a pretty busy area, it's not like I'm out in the middle of nowhere. My street runs between two major roads in my city). We can't even prove that she did drive by.

And of course, DH is out of town for work all weekend so it's just me and the kids home. He won't be home until Friday. My mom is out of town visiting her gf, so we can't go over there. I have a friend coming over to sit with me when she gets off work, but seriously??

Anyways. I'll update if anything happens.

"A little background about me: I’m an Asian married into an American family. I’ve lived in the US for about 7 years now.

Even since my husband and I were just boyfriend and girlfriend, his mother always tried to befriend me and get close to me. She’s very pushy about it too. I always feel uncomfortable around her. She always tries to hang out with me alone and I always avoid it by saying I work all the time. It’s just very annoying when someone you don’t want to be around keeps asking you to hang out. My husband doesn’t have a good relationship with her either so I feel no obligation to hang out with her.
The reason I mentioned my race is because I think it could because in my culture, MIL isn’t friend with their daughter in law. They don’t hang out alone like I’ve seen in American culture. I don’t know how to act when she asks me to hang out. She doesn’t even take a hint. After 5 years of her trying and me avoiding, she still asks me to hang out with her and I’m still avoiding.

Please give me your opinion/advice.",JUSTNOMIL
"So, it’s been a long time since I’ve posted but I have enough spoons tonight to share some stuff. Check my history if you don’t recall. I decided to name my MIL PistachiNo after how she put pistachios in my sons toys knowing he could potentially have a severe allergy to them. Good news, she hasn’t seen my son but once and that was on FaceTime...and against my wishes.

DH decided on his own to regain a little bit of a relationship with his dad. That’s fine. That’s his choice, his dad didn’t absolutely suck. He was just an enabler. But MIL he wanted nothing to do with. Then FIL decided that he couldn’t have a “healthy relationship” with DH if DH wouldn’t see MIL. Insert eye roll. I told DH it was 100% on him and I wasn’t going to make that choice but she absolutely would have nothing to do with myself or our son, ever. He understood.

He went to go visit them one day for his dads birthday (they live about 40 minutes away). They were just going to have lunch and chat. MIL got her jabs in where she could but for the most part she was just trying her best to win him back. He’s only seen her twice and only spoken to her a handful of times, mostly when he’s called his dad and his dad has the phone on speaker phone.

She keeps trying to weasel in. My mom has bordered on JustNo lines several times and is actively encouraging me to let my son back in her life. That I don’t know “how much it’s going to hurt him down the line”. She’s a bit blinded because of a situation with my cousins and my grandma. I let it slide but keep reiterating to her that she is wrong and will not see my son.

You see, I’m a teacher, and my husband wasn’t working for quite a while due to disability. So he had our son at home and was living the stay at home dad life. Each morning during my planning period I would FaceTime with them so I could see them. DH called PistachiNo Sunday because it was her birthday. She didn’t answer but knew he was home with DS each day while I was at work. She FaceTimed him and DS heard the ring and immediately answered thinking it was me calling. He was sad it wasn’t mommy and didn’t know who “that lady” was on the phone 😂.

DH explained that it was his mom and thus, his Grandma. Once he heard Grandma he got excited and started showing her all his toys just like any 3 year old would. “This one is from my normal Grandma and Papa” “This one is from Santa.” “This one my mommy and I got last week” etc etc. the “normal Grandma” one had me about die. But the best part? You could tell she was fishing to see if we ever tell him about her and she asked “How many Grandmas and Grandpas do you have?” His answer?


“I have one Grandma, and one Papa”. When DH told me this it was a solid 5 minutes of laughing so hard I was crying. Play bitch games, get bitch prizes. He hasn’t mentioned her or anything but he gets so excited and asks to talk to my parents almost daily. Suck it bitch. I think I’ll update with old stories in the coming days. I have a bunch.",JUSTNOMIL
"Because of a sudden dip in my mental health and realizing it's not going to get better on its own, I've started looking into becoming medicated and researching various mental illnesses. I had therapy yesterday (for anxiety, I've been going for nearly 6 years now), and I told my therapist about my mental health journey and that I thought I may be ADHD. He agreed and also suggested a mild bipolar disorder, and we discussed good psychiatrists in the area that he recommends. 

I was excited! I felt like I was stuck on pause for so long and I finally made a little bit of progress!! So I told my mom at lunch with my grandma, because I was excited and I just wanted assurance that I'm heading in the right direction. I told her about him agreeing about potential ADHD, and she turns to my grandma and goes: 

""Obviously, she left out detail x and y, because any good therapist —"" I interrupted her right there, because I *did* tell him those things, and he still suggested the possibilities. She wasn't in the room with me, so why does she think she knows how my session went better than I do? 

The conversation continues, and bipolar disorder comes up, and I mentioned that my therapist suggested I could be bipolar. Ignoring the horrible way she talked about those who are bipolar, she says to me: 

""Cakebatter, there's nothing wrong with you, you just want there to be something wrong with you. Why do you want there to be something wrong with you?""

So I told her off for invalidating me, to which she says that she wasn't invalidating me, she just loves me and wants to help and support me, even if it means ""helping me from myself,"" whatever the fuck that means.",JUSTNOMIL
"&amp;#x200B;

DH is out getting his hair cut and I'm trying to work online on my laptop while he is out. Baby Jane says to me ""I suppose we should get (name) something for Father's Day! Because I know he's not a father but he has all these cats.""

I looked at her and said ""that's interesting because I don't remember getting anything for Mother's Day."" She changed the subject quickly by saying ""Did \*I\* get anything for Mother's Day?"". Yes, yes you did. I didn't expect anything for being a ""mother"" to my pets nor does DH expect anything for Fathers Day.

To make matters worse, she's always telling him not to chew his food so quickly, not to eat so much, and to go on a diet. So what is her suggested Father's Day gift? She shows me the newspaper and it's an ad for a Cold Stone Creamery ice cream cake. DH legit hates ice cream cake on top of everything else so I thought that was pretty funny.

I'm not even gonna go into how she has declared herself the ""grandmother"" of our two new cats and then went on to say that DH is the ""grandfather"". I said so is DH your husband now? Because that is the only way he would be grandfather to his own cats. When I questioned her on that logic she just sputtered. Creepy AF Jocasta shite. It's OK though because I have picked up the cat a few times and said ""Come along now, shitty grandma doesn't want you in her room!"".",JUSTNOMIL
"Trigger warning: Mental Health

I have suffered from anxiety and depression for 15 years (longer really but I’m going from when I was diagnosed and started treatment). I had antenatal depression once, postnatal depression twice and PTSD from birth trauma. About 2 years ago my MIL and SIL went too far and publicly shamed me and said there is no such thing. Just weakness and being a selfish Mother. I’ve never forgiven them for this. There was a lot beforehand and a lot after that I’ve ignored but I cannot ignore this.

What’s interesting right now is; I’ve been informed that MIL is depressed. I’m not arguing that she isn’t, I’m trying to help her and I’m not happy she’s depressed. What does make me smile is that she and SIL cannot insult my mental health anymore without insulting MIL. I wonder if they regret saying what they have said. I know it won’t happen but maybe they will respect and understand my struggles now. Maybe I’m a bit of an asshole for taking some pleasure from her current situation.",JUSTNOMIL
"I just need to get a few things off of my chest. 

Stepmom of one. Been at this gig for almost five years now. Met my stepdaughter before she started elementary school and have gotten to watch her grow. Blended family life definitely has its ups and downs. 

Little backstory of our situation:
Before I came into my DH’s life, he was active duty military and deployed to Iraq for a tour. He was stationed states away from home and his parents helped my with step daughter while he was gone. My in laws held a primary care giver role and spent tons of time with my step daughter. 

My in laws are good people. They are awesome grandparents to our children and have done tons to help my DH and I over the years while we were just getting started as a blended family. 

Not sure how to accurately describe my step daughter’s BM. It’s almost as if a child is trying to raise a child. She is irresponsible, unreliable, and suffers with mental health issues with she does not treat. She is unemployed and does not drive due to multiple arrests. She has been charged with child neglect in the past and yet still somehow has custody of my step daughter. We’ve tried to gain full custody. She has put my husband and I AS WELL AS my in laws through years of shit. One time BM even came to my in laws home and took my step daughter from her bed in the middle of the night. Just years of hell. 

As a step Mom, I’ve had to take on a lot of responsibility that her BM slacks on. We share 50/50 custody. I’m commonly responsible for all of my SD’s health care appointments, therapy sessions, sports, immunizations, etc. My husband works tons to support our family and I’ve taken on the role of helping with my step daughter and don’t mind doing it. BM, DH, and I have an okay time communicating. There hasn’t been any crazy arguments for a few years. 

Throughout the years my in laws have had a hard time letting go of their primary care giver role of my step daughter. At times it has felt a little obsessive and extreme. Years ago, they would have my step daughter over to their home for the night and not even mention it to my husband and I. My father in law even excused the behavior saying my mother in law just needed to get her “fix” of my step daughter. Recently, they have been better but still have a few episodes a year. Which leads me to the most recent.

My SD was pretty sick a few weeks back. She was hospitalized and is finally home on the mend. BM was present for this and I am happy she stayed with my step daughter in the hospital. My in laws made the biggest deal about her Mom being there for her. What a wonderful Mother she was. How great of her. Blah blah blah. Eye roll. SHE IS A MOTHER. She should have been there. There was tons of ass kissing and just weird behavior on my in laws part. It was so fake. 

One of the viruses that my step daughter tested positive for, I can NOT be around as I am pregnant with our forth child. It was determined by a specialist that I could not be exposed to my step daughter until she was not contagious. Anyways, we asked my in laws to help out for some time and they gladly accepted. As of today, I am finally able to be around my step daughter. 

Tomorrow, my step daughter has a follow up doctor appointment. MIL informed us that she would be taking my step daughter. She also informed us that she has asked BM to stay the night at their home with my step daughter the night before the appointment. She didn’t ask my husband or I how we felt about this prior to making the arrangements. Just informed us when we brought up asking about the plans for the appointment. We just find it very strange and told them we didn’t agree with this decision. To which we didn’t get a response. Furthermore, my SD struggles with severe depression and often expresses wishing her parents were back together and wishing it could go back to how it use to be. She struggles with having a blended family and we feel this sleepover doesn’t help her cope with her reality. Yes, we’ve tried to talk to them in the past about over stepping boundaries, the conversation didn’t go well. MIL stormed off and ended the conversation.

Idk why I am so upset about this but it infuriated me. Maybe it’s the hormones of this pregnancy. We just don’t understand. We encourage and want my step daughter to see a loving relationship between her mother and DH’s parents but this is taking it too far for our comfort.",JUSTNOMIL
"Ok so this happen when I was with my oldest sons dad and pregnant with my oldest. We had planned to get married got the stuff set up for a shot gun wedding but we both knew we were unhappy. Sorry this is so long just feels good to get it off my chest after so long. 

My ex has left home the day he was 18 due to how toxic his step mother was and still is. I have many issues with this lady to this day but I'm just going to tell you how it all started.

So me and my ex were living with my parents and my ex had told me he had talked to his dad since his 18th birthday and he was 19 already. It had been a year and a half. Well his step mom had been texting me on my phone playing nice and being 2 faced. I had convinced him to get his father a father's day car and drop it off to him. So we went to Walmart got the card and headed over there. I let him take it up there him self took about 10 min then we were headed home.

Well him having exstream anxiety about it I had put him to sleep in my lap so I had both his cell and mine. At this point it had been about 3 hours so it was about 10 at night. She's texting me all nice and thanking for the card. She texted him a nasty message saying how he should have never came to her house and how he's not welcome there.

 All I had texted her from his phone was. ""cault you B***h"" and she stoped texting both of us. She then goes on to tell NY exs sister I hope him and his bastered son get hit by a car and way way more.

Fast forward to fourth of July of 2013 we get a text his dad's house cault on fire. Only the kitchen was damaged and no one was hurt. His step mom then aims blame at my 100% JYMIL (I have adopted her as my own so she is still my mother in law) and convinces my exs youngest sister that it was her and that's what they told the cops. They do the investigation and low and behold is was cause of exsmil hoarding and using construction lights that has fell over and the heat caused them to light fire to all the stuff off the back porch.

"I thought I escaped I thought I was done. I was just waiting to move a thousand miles away. But then the world had different plans. I have lupus. It turns out that Lupus stresses my body out so much that it causes muscle weakness. I've mentioned it before in previous posts. I was happy and married and healed. But then I got another flare up. This time instead of my legs only getting weakness, this time my arms went too. 

&amp;#x200B;

I told my brother who I had reconciled with on the condition that we go to therapy together which he agreed, that I was going to the hospital. I texted him and my JnF just as a heads up that I was going in and would let them know when I wanted visitors. 3 hours later they both show up. I was pissed and my DH was pissed. If there is one person who dislikes them after what happened more than me its DH.

&amp;#x200B;

My JnF tried saying ""Maybe this is being caused by the rift between us and maybe its time to let things go.""  I was too tired and scared about being paralyzed to say anything other than I dont want to talk about it. Remember they never apologized for holding me hostage on my wedding day ( that post is in JnFamily). 

&amp;#x200B;

And then after a day or two I began looking at our future our finances and how things are going to be affected by this. I've all but confirmed this loss of mobility due to muscle weakness will be an ongoing thing for the foreseeable future. I realized DH and I cant make it without my income where it is. We needed help. 

&amp;#x200B;

I sat DH down and told him my plan. My plan to play nice with JnF and Hot Stove. I hated it and had tears in my eyes but I knew they would throw money at me to make things ok and help out with bills and everything. They are the type to bribe to make us rugsweep. I told DH he did not have to interact with them or be there at all, he is currently NC still. Our plan is still to go to Mississippi. I do not forgive them. I am willing to do what it takes to make sure my DH wont have to struggle to keep our little family (us and two kitty babies) afloat. Even if it means putting myself back on the fire.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day I call my dad and break down, telling him how scared I was and how much I needed them right now. He told me he would help and not to worry. A couple hours later he shows up with a wheelchair from walmart to help me get to any of my appointments.  Hot Stove has not asked how I am in all of this just wanted to know about my treatments and all my personal stuff from my doctors. My GP has called from her personal cell to check up on me more than Hot Stove. I at least know that if I play nice they will pay for anything we need. I just have to hold out until we move. Then its back to barely speaking again and sweet bliss.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this too much? Am I being the JustNo by doing this? Basically using them for money?

&amp;#x200B;

::TLDR:: I get a serious illness flare up.  JnF tries to get me to rugsweep while im in the hospital. I realize we need money. I beg JnF and Hot Stove for help and they start to bend to ""apologize."" The plan is still to go NC with them when we move.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your responses. I do realize now I was scared when I made the decision. I will keep my parents on the back burner (pun intended) but my main avenue will be getting income other sorts of ways such as ssd as other posters came out to say.

A couple notes to add from today: I went to the hospital again. I couldnt open my eyes or speak my husband had to call 911. I was conscious and could hear everything which was scary. Hot Stove couldnt bother to come and My dad let my husband take a 30 minute break to get food and walk around and managed to make it 3 minutes before calling his sister and stepping out to shoot the shit with her. My husband came back and he was still talking. He stayed for about an hour total. 

They proved once again they will never be there for me the way they should as parents. If they offer to help out money wise I will accept it. But I'm still so done.",JUSTNOMIL
"I'm not sure if I'm the JN, my mom is, or neither of us are. This is a bit of different type of story than what you typically see here, but I think I would benefit from some feedback. I have an immense amount of respect for the logic and wisdom I see here. 



A little background: this last year has been tumultuous to say the least. I had my first baby, was diagnosed with PPD, and then had to get myself out of my relationship with her father. He became verbally, then physically abusive shortly before she was born. After 8 weeks, I returned to a very stressful job. My dad came to stay with my daughter and I to ""help out"" because of mandatory OT and because I was only getting 2-3 hours of sleep at a time. It became very apparent that he just came to help himself to a free place to stay. He was a burden at the most difficult time in my life, so he is no longer here and our relationship is practically nonexistent now. In February, 3 months after returning to work, I was fired for getting very sick twice in a month, in spite of doctors notes and going to work sick. (That employer does shit like that all the time, my *monthly* performance reviews were good.) I haven't been able to find a decent job since. I've been living off of savings ( that will be gone this month) and doing odd jobs. I cut out all nonessentials. 



So on to what I need advice on. My mom promised to provide childcare for the first year of my daughter's life and has delivered. (Her main concern being that daycare workers only have 2 hands, ratio usually 4-1 and she didnt want my daughter to wait to be fed so young etc). And yes, she had bragging rights and attention when she had my daughter with her. Not mad at it. We had a few issues with boundary stomping (going through my mail/paperwork, trying to overrule my decisions as mom etc), but we seemed to have worked it out. I am EXTREMELY thankful for all her time, effort and yes sacrifices watching my daughter while I've worked.



My dilemma? She is sticking to her care cutoff date. This is her right to do, I know this logically. She does not owe me and my daughter is my responsibility. (CS is a no go, $50/month bc he's paid under the table and i have no idea where he works now) But I cannot help but feel resentful. Logically, I know I'm being an entitled brat, but I resent that she will sit at home (disabled for 10+ years), doing nothing but watch tv, play games on her phone or go shopping, maybe the occasional get together with a girlfriend. Then tell me how much she misses my daughter. How bored she is. How sad and depressed she is bc she has nothing to do and her retired husband doesn't pay any attention to her. I don't resent her for not doing of ALL of the childcare, but maybe 1-2 days a week? Half days? Something to help me save money?



Because here's the thing, I cannot afford $650 in monthly childcare. Even with public assistance. I would be forced to file bankruptcy and lose my car (then have come up with money to find another, my city is not car-less friendly). I have spent the last 3 years building my credit, paying off debt, building the savings that I've been living off of for the past 6 months, forgoing things I'd love to have, getting nails done, facials, more than a couple pairs of shoes, etc. My budget is pared down to the bone. And she could help me and is chosing not to? When she left her first 2 husbands (and even this 3rd one she's been back together with for years), she ran to family. Had a free place to stay and some help with childcare. Was it easy? No, but she wasn't carrying what I'll be carrying in September. The count is 5 times she's left a husband and made sure to align herself with family to share the burden. But wants to tell me all about how she knows exactly what I'm going through. Ok, but only kinda. It wasn't ALL on her shoulders like it will be for me in September.



She knows I'm stressed about money, that I'm barely making it now. In her defense, maybe she dosen't truly understand that if the money isn't there, it isn't there. She's not the best with money and hasn't had to look at household expenses for 10+ years.




So what say you? Do I need to get over my entitled self? Sit down and show her the numbers and ask her to reconsider how much she might be able to help with childcare? Ask for a loan and be willing to sign docs so they don't feel taken advantage of?",JUSTNOMIL
"Backstory: Almost a year ago I had a massive stroke due to an arterial defect. I coded and was temporarily on life support. I barely lived after they removed part of my brain. My mother’s friend’s only son died about 2 years ago and my mom stalks her Facebook. Mom is also a malignant narcissist.

"DH and I had another agrument today. I was complaining about how it might be difficult for me to find another job that will work with the rule my inlaws set for babysitting (since he still insists we use them until things ""cool off"" and since we don't have the finances for a daycare or actual babysitter atm, trying to get state assistance for that). They have a rule set that they will only watch LO 24 hours a week, 6 hours for 4 days. I also have to go to the town 30 minutes away for court ordered councelling (I mentioned this before, its for a CPS case for DH's daughters from his previous marriage, we are the nonoffensing party but still have to take all the steps to get custody of them) which has to fit into their 24 hours, leaving me basically only 22 and a half or less hours work every week. Anyone with a lick of common sense can see how this might be an issue with some employers, but I'm trying.

Idk if DH thinks I am being irrational or he might even think I'm creating a problem that isn't really there, but he acted annoyed at first that I was expressing these concerns and he went on a bit of a tangent about how I have to ""stop being immature (his and his family's favorite new word to describe me)"" and just do what I have to do (in reguards to getting housework done since I expressed trying to find a job that wasn't housekeeping so keeping our home clean would be easier).

My phone was dying and when we hung up the phone, we were both still upset about it. Since the argument, I have had a sinking feeling in my gut and I realized that I'm concerned that he will go to his mother or father about this and tomorrow morning I will be met with another barrage of insults and abuse telling me what a fuckup I am (for lack of a better word). I want to trust that DH won't do that to me, but I don't think he is taking the gravity of the situation seriously and how much it effected me.

I'm not even sure if we are going to talk again tonight for me to know what to expect about tomorrow. We are so deeply involved with them financially (on their phone plan, share a storage unit, share a mailbox, can't move anywhere without their help rn because we live in an RV and don't have a truck to pull it ourselves) at least until about March of next year and I'm not sure I can last that long.

All the stress from everything that has happened this last month with MIL, I have dropped weight and barely sleep for more than a few hours at a time. Just these last several days after she went off on me accusing me of cheating and insulting my family, I was only able to eat a full meal again without throwing it up from stress yesterday. I have been living off small snacks here and there since Tuesday and I'm pretty sure part of me gaining back my ability to eat came from having 3 days off work that I don't have to see my inlaws. She has been acting like nothing happened. Sending me jobs available, asking me and DH to do some favors, etc. I've either let DH reply or have kept it to ""okay, thanks"" kind of responses. I only respond because I'm paranoid about her looking up phone records and seeing that I have been using the phone for internet and not responding and then getting a verbal lashing again. The wifi we have available here sucks so I use the data a lot, but I'm now changing that. I'd rather have crappy slow internet than be paranoid about someone snooping on me.

DH talked to FIL who basically summed up MIL's explosion as them just being concerned because if something happened to LO in their care and they had to take him to the emergency room, they wouldn't know what vaccinations he had and concerned about the ""state of our house and car"". They all completely skirted around her alligations and her insults. Don't even think it was touched because DH ""didn't want to deal with it"". I also feel like I don't have much of a leg to stand on because of what happened between us and it feels almost wrong asking him to stand up for me after I hurt him.

I honestly feel trapped in a terribly toxic situation and like I'm tiptoeing around sleeping lions. One slightly wrong move and I'll be pounced on with no backup to help me out even with things that are none of their business. I haven't been able to bring up couples counceling with him in the last several days and on Wednesday he also has a court ordered councelling session with the same therapist I see who might help him shine a light on the situation for him. If he refuses to try the online couples counseling, I very likely will file the paperwork to end our marriage.",JUSTNOMIL
"Yesterday I saw JNMIL for the first time since her 7-week visit after LO was born. This woman has been extremely controlling, manipulative and entitled since LO was born, so I've had to set major boundaries to protect my well-being and LO. I've also had minimal contact with her over the last four months (see my prior posts). 

DH, myself, and DH's friend met JNMIL and FIL for lunch yesterday and we brought LO. I've been dreading this day for months. I would've skipped the lunch, but I don't trust JNMIL with LO. So here's what happened:

1. As soon as we arrived,JNMIL bee-lined over to LO and I in the parking lot. She was all excited and immediately hugged me. It was bizarre- I guess she thought I had completely forgotten all of the stuff she pulled after LO was born. Anyway, I gave her a half hug back in an attempt to be civil. 

2. As we were heading into the restaurant, JNMIL came over to me again and then got into my face and  tried to kiss me on the cheek. She has no respect for personal space and it was especially inappropriate for her to try to kiss me in light of everything she's done.
So I put my hand up to block the kiss and said ""no."" She immediately started crying. DH noticed that she was crying and told her that it was making things worse,  so she went into the bathroom to cry. 

3. After she came out of the bathroom, she came over to interact with LO. I could tell he wasn't sure about her, but she got right up in his face to try to get a reaction out of him. She has a habit of completely disregarding other people's privacy and personal space, especially LO. So I said ""let's give him some space please."" She looked very surprised, but she backed away and got weepy again. 

4. JNMIL initially sat across from FIL at lunch, but then she moved across from me so that she could be closer to LO. I wasn't thrilled, but I wanted to give her the chance to see LO. Of course. she tried to be all chatty with me, but I grey-rocked her and gave mostly one-word answers the entire time. 

5. JNMIL wasn't happy with my setting boundaries and grey-rocking her, so she attempted to put me in my place by reminding me of the time she took me for mani-pedis and lunch during her last visit. She then tried to push the issue by asking if I remembered that day. It was obvious what she was trying to do, so I just said, ""I think I might remember something like that."" 

I'm trying to be civil, but JNMIL clearly came into this weekend with the unreasonable expectation that everything was going to be peachy. That's on her. JNMIL is extremely narcissistic and so I hope that she doesn't pull something at the baptism tomorrow. Wish me luck.",JUSTNOMIL
"I've been writing fairly comedic Irrational Irene stories, but this one isn't really. I wanted to share the story behind NC and talk about our 1000mi exodus and starting over. 

I talked before about how she tried to ruin our wedding, which is partly the start to this story.  TL;DR She tried to make Irrational demands weeks before the wedding, almost doesn't go, then tries to tell my mom off at the rehearsal dinner, but gets smacked down by my mom instead. 

The other part begins when Irrational Irene and FIL buy SIL a house. At the time SIL was ""renting"" from them at a reduced rate. Since DH and I were renting a shithole apartment from a slumlord that was infested with black mold that was making me seriously ill, we asked if we could take over her apartment when she moved out. It is important to note that where we lived rent was extremely high and we were on a limited income. The only way for us to move into a new place was a situation like this. They said yes. We asked them to tell us when to give notice,  and they say the end of the next month. So we do.

And we were almost homeless because the closing on the house got pushed back and it was ""unfair of us"" to expect SIL to move out so fast. 

We finally made it into the apartment, which still has SIL's s  stuff in it. She hadn't even finished packing! She knew she was leaving for three months. She claimed it was because she was pregnant. So guess who packed the rest if her stuff up? Me! 

Then there was the basement. Oh God the basement. Basically SIL is also a MASSIVE hoarder. The crap was TOUCHING THE CEILING and crawling up the stairs. When we complained we were told she had ""as much time as she needed"" to clean out the basement. Oh, and we weren't allowed to tell the post office she had moved, and we were to allow her to show up to the house and go through the mail. We told SIL she had 3 months to fix that situation. She assured us she would change her address once her tax return came in. 

Then we caught her in OUR HOUSE WHEN WE WEREN'T HOME! And we noticed some stuff missing. Since SIL had sticky hands we knew she had stolen them. So we changed the locks. The next day we get a screeching phone call from her saying that we couldn't deny her access to HER apartment! We told her she still had access to her stuff in the basement, and could she start cleaning that out? She threatened to break into our house and beat us both. So we told her if she tried to break in we would call the cops. Irrational Irene called us after that asking how we could DARE tell her pregnant daughter we would call the cops on her? When DH pointed out that breaking into a house was a crime, Irrational Irene said we should just let his sister do ""whatever she wants because she is pregnant."" My husband stood his ground and said if he caught her in our apartment again we would call the cops, end of story. 

After 3 months we warned SIL we were going to the post office to have her mail stopped being delivered to the house, and two weeks later we did that. A month later after a huge fight SIL, Irrational Irene, and FIL cleaned out the basement. It literally took a week working non stop. 

Then the blowout over the wedding, made worse by SIL claiming we were stealing mail. Even though this was another 3 months after we had stopped having mail delivered. It was all designed to ruin our marriage at that point. FIL got in on the action and called DH a loser, and said that's all he'd ever be. When DH said how hurtful that was FIL said ""you shouldn't be hurt by the truth. Just accept you'll never amount to anything. Like I have!"" DH quit working for him after that.

Two weeks after the wedding Irrational Irene called DH like NOTHING had happened, asking about what are plans for the holiday were. DH told her that we weren't going this year. He was still angry at how she acted around the wedding and it would be best if they stayed away from each other for a little while to cool off. So she told him that they were selling the apartment building we lived in and we had to get out. DH called FIL to ask if this was true and he said ""first I'm hearing of this! We have no plans to sell the building"". 

Three days later FIL calls to say they are selling the building and we have 4 months to move out.

DH sat down with him and asked if we could stop paying rent for those months so we could save up to move. FIL agreed. 

Over the next 4 months Irrational Irene sent us letters, text messages, Facebook messages, sent messages through other family members, and even showed up on our doorstep a couple times (we didn't answer). We knew this would be our life if we stayed in the area. We decided to move 1000mi to an area with much cheaper rent and the added bonus of being so far away she couldn't show up on our doorstep.

It was super hard. I had lived away from family before, but DH never had. It was a huge culture shock for him and we struggled really hard. At one point we were sharing 1 package of ramen a day. DH had to delete his social media and change his phone number to stop harassment from family members. Eventually we pulled ourselves up, and DH got a steady job, and threw off the chains his family put on him. 

It's been almost 3 years and going NC was the best thing we could have done. DH learned to take care if himself and gained so much more confidence now that he isn't constantly told he is incapable of doing things on his own. We no longer live in fear of Irrational Irene guilt tripping us or showing up on our doorstep. And our relationship is stronger than ever without his family putting pressure on us all the time. I know he still harbours a lot of anger, resentment, and hate towards all three of them but he's working on it. It also helps that after Irrational Irene went off on my mom at the rehearsal dinner, my family basically adopted him. 

It's scary to go NC. But sometimes it really works out for the best.

"I thankfully have not had the need to post for quite a while. It’s great having nothing to do with her and I would like to keep it that way. 
However DH has been telling me that Gollum has been searching and looking for a house to buy in surrounding suburbs. Considering she has shown her dislike of our location I just can’t understand why she would bother looking at houses near us. Especially when she knows I want nothing to do with her.

The only satisfaction I have right now is that baby no. 2 is cooking away and by the time she finds out she will be the last person To find out! DH happily told his dad (divorced from MIL ) and some other siblings but has yet to call her to tell her the news. He asked me when he should tell her and I said it’s your choice I am not getting involved. She will either be really excited or super negative. I almost hope she is negative because that will really set DH off and I like it when she self sabotages her relationship because it means I’m not the one to be blamed for it. If she happens to find out second hand hen I don’t mind either as it shows her that she is low on the priority list.",JUSTNOMIL
"I haven't seen Waffles since March, and I don't intend to anytime soon. She's trying to ""apologize,"" but she's so bad at it that I think this may be her first apology ever.

First, DH and I are moving in a few weeks. My mom has come over several times to help us pack. Waffles hasn't once offered to help us pack or move...and tonight, she called DH to ask him if \*he'll\* help \*her\* move into her boyfriend's house next weekend. Nice.

Second, on Tuesday of this week, Waffles sent me a novel-length ""apology"" text. In it, she apologized for ""how \[I\] felt about \[her\]"", lied about only wanting the one wedding picture without me in it, said that she's ""looking forward to good relationships with me"", etc. Rather than ignore her like I have been, I decided to actually answer and speak my piece. I sent back an equally long text, explaining some of my feelings, and why I was hurt by the wedding picture situation.

That was four days ago, and now...nothing. She didn't even answer.

I find that just straight-up rude. She was so insistent on talking to me, and I finally gave in, and it turns out that she had no interest in starting a dialogue; she just wanted to spit out an apology at me so she could say that she could. 

On one hand, she's so terrible at this that it's almost comical. But on the other hand, it truly is frustrating, because now I look like the bitch for not rolling over and accepting her half-baked ""apology.""",JUSTNOMIL
"Had dinner with my new JNMIL this week after going with her and GMIL to pick out their wedding gift to DH and I. JNMIL had a shitty mood the whole time and complained about her mother spending money on us after depending on her mother for anything financial for literal years. 

At dinner, we we're having a lovely time discussing our wedding that just took place last weekend. JNMIL decided to get a glass of wine and became intoxicated very quickly. She asked us about a guest at our wedding a simple ""who was this person."" We mentioned that the person she was thinking about was a friend of DH's father, and she immediately switched gears and said what a bitch this guest was. Let me just mention that JNMIL didn't even know this person's name and was suddenly calling them a bitch. It's also worth mentioning that JNMIL and FIL are not together and hate eachother. We all mentioned that she was being ridiculous. GMIL says to JNMIL, ""you're letting someone you don't know bug you.""
JNMIL responds with, ""I'm not saying it bugs me. I'm saying it pisses me off."" 
This is humourous considering she used a damn synonym. GMIL chuckles and JNMIL makes an even bigger scene saying, ""I say something upsets me and you laugh at me,"" then storms out of the restaurant. It was pretty obnoxious and the whole restaurant was staring. 

It just seems like she always has to make it about her. We're going to get a present for my new husband and I and she complains the whole time. We speak about how great our wedding was and she has to switch it around and find something wrong with it. It's just all very frustrating. I knew she was a little crazy before we got married but it was all BEC and it feels like she's turned the dial up to 10 now that we're actually married.",JUSTNOMIL
"FH has fucking MRSA. 

His bug bite turned septic and he has mrsa. 

She’s shown a little bit more concern but mostly to tell him to keep it clean as if he’s a dumb child and doesn’t know this. She’s sent him money which has fucked me off. He was on the phone to her yesterday and she told him to say hi to me for her. She’s not just stupid and ignorant, she’s wilfully stupid and ignorant. She’s also implored him to call at x time on x day for fils birthday. He’s going to but I’m still having no part in it. 


In other news, for the wonderful, wonderful people who commented and messaged me, were fine and we’re going ok. Our insurance can do jack shit against the uninsured driver who totalled our car, so I’m having to file a civil claim against him at magistrates court. Luckily this is what I went to school for so it’s right in my wheelhouse. Just a huge hassle that we really don’t need though. 

A wonderful woman has offered us a place to stay in exchange for work, at a much cheaper rate so we can make some money on the side while we look for work here. I’m just so low at the moment. Like a week ago we were so happy and having the time of our lives and now we live next door to a bunch of asshole french teens who get drunk and blast music til three am.

I feel so trapped without a car. All the towing company could offer us to scrap it was $100, and we bought it for six grand a month ago. We just can’t catch a break. 

I just wanted to check in and thank everyone who has offered help, money, a place to stay and just kindness.

"Hey everyone. I hope all is well. I’ve been crazy busy in life after graduation and there wasn’t much to report on how it went.


I landed a job right before graduation. Entry level and basic pay, but for SO and I, the job doubles our annual income. I tried to keep details of the job low key, not just from Flight Trap but there’s other JustNos in our lives that will jump an opportunity to borrow money or take advantage of the situation. However, even keeping details quiet it is a full time job and it’s not rocket science to guess that our income is changing significantly compared to what it was since we both work full time now instead of one full time and one freelancing student.



Graduation was in mid-May, Flight Trap arrived and mostly stuck to boundaries. It was really kind of nice. I was really kind of confused. The biggest issue in my opinion was her spending on stupid stuff, but not my bank account and not my problem. There were small moments, but not to her normal scale. It was just... nice. And that should have been my red flag.



She went back to the home state and for a few days after that all seemed well.



But then it started. Little mentions of money. Little mentions of them not having money. I’m paid twice a month, so three weeks after I started my job there was a comment to the effect of: How’s the job going? Surely you’ve gotten a paycheck by now. 



I kept blowing the money comments off and tried to remain pleasant. The trip was **nice.** I had hoped things would stay that way and the past could find itself *in the past.* But as I ignored the comments, the pleasant conversations faded. My birthday fell during this time, and came and went without so much as a text from Flight Trap.



She finally called four days ago, and let me know they were in an awful way and that they just can’t get caught up. She made sure to tell me how disappointing it was that *no one* would help them, but made sure not to mention me by name. When that didn’t move me, she got off the phone and said she’d call me later.



*I guess nothing really changes after all.*

"Now that the post-wedding dust has settled and we had come to a decision on how to handle JNMIL/FIL, we were happily going about married life until FIL called. For some reason DH answered (because dumb? Expecting a reasonable conversation from unreasonable people?). FIL immediately launched into a rant about me and how now that we are married it's my insidious plan to take over DH's life and separate him from his family so I can control him (for what purpose? Maybe world domination, who knows). 

He went on to give their conditions for forgiveness. I must apologize profusely and admit that I made up the entire story of MIL talking trash at our wedding for attention. We must drive 4 hours each way to visit them on a regular basis and must initiate phone calls to them regularly to ask about their lives. I must also publicly (via Facebook) admit my obvious drama-mongering and lies to everyone we know so that everyone will see how horrible I am. If we choose not to agree to any of the above, they will sever all ties with DH and employ a lawyer to rewrite their will without him in it. 

He was understandably really upset and angry, but has since calmed down and is adopting a ""well fuck you too then"" attitude about it. Forfeiting whatever pennies will be left when they die kinda seems like a small price to pay for freedom from their bullshit, honestly.

BUT I am pretty certain that this won't be the end of it. The whole lawyer thing came off as a pretty obvious ploy to manipulate DH into grovelling and throwing me under the bus and when it becomes clear that it hasn't worked they'll move on to the next tactic. We're proactively blocking anyone we know of on mobile/social media that might potentially give them info on our lives or participate in any FM behavior for the moment.

"It was quiet until last night. FIL started texting SO saying that he needs to call as soon as he's free because they need to have a talk. Obviously this was over my honesty towards MIL. This is her usual tactic when she thinks I'm mad. Blow it up in her mind, cry to FIL, who then talks to SO and that's it. I could never be involved in this discussion even though I'm the main topic of it.

Anyways, SO ignored him until this morning. Sent a response saying ""Sorry, I'm not getting involved and I don't want to be the middle man anymore.""

EDIT: FIL texted him again at the end of day as expected.

""Well that's unfortunate. First off your mother didn't want me to get involved as she believes I'll make it worse. Shes really upset. Thats why I texted you only. I wanted to talk to you so I can figure out what happened and what we have done wrong so I can better understand. She didn't even want to tell me till I got home last night. I dont need you in the middle. I too are confused about this right now. I dont like texting these conversations because they can be taken out of context so find a time and call me.""



There was no response as of yet. My guess is that his phone will start ringing like crazy once supper time hits and they're sure he's off work. This pisses me the fuck off, so I sent one more text to MIL because fuck her games.

""MIL, what I said the other day was not rude, hurtful, or personally attacking you in any way and there is no reason to involve FIL and SO. I was simply being honest about how I feel, not looking for apologies or to rehash anything which is why I did not mention anything specific, I was communicating the fact that now is not a good time to try to form some sort of friendship. We are both adult woman who are capable of managing our own emotions without involving other people who are irrelevant to the situation. Like I said, I'm not looking to open up a discussion and I know SO has no interest in playing the middle man with FIL. He is working 10-12+ hour days and the last thing he needs is to be dragged into a situation where is he expected to provide emotional support to other adults. I expect that we can both be civil and respectful to each other without further discussion, nothing has changed. I made it very clear that I'm not trying to cut you out. I'm just not interested in putting the effort and time in to change the dynamic of our relationship at this point. Please respect that. There is no sense in creating a problem out of a non issue especially when SO and I are preparing for a huge change in our lives that is very exciting for us.""

Her response:

""I do not want to start anything or to cause disruption in your lives (far from it) I did include FIL as your text also included him. I just wish you would give me the chance to defend myself. I have back in my texts and fb messages to you and there are numerous ones dating two years back. I have reached out to you numerous times. I have even called you numerous times. SO had told me one time that calls and texts don't always go through at the house so I should message. I don't know how you can say I have never tried as it's not so. I'm sorry but I'm at a loss.""

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know what to say back to her because she is just not getting the point. We aren't even friends on facebook so I'm not sure why she would bring up facebook messages.

"Hello everyone, I just kind of wanted to rant/ talk(type?) about an experience years ago that been plaguing my mind recently. Not sure why it is but maybe its due cause I've never talked about it since it happens.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure how common this is but in my family, being sick is not an excuse to miss out on school/work. Back before college ANYTIME I got sick, I was maybe allowed to take off one day from school and that was it. Didn't matter if I was coughing up flem, barely able to breath or super contagious I was forced to go back to school. To my family the reason why I was never allowed more than one day off was because they wanted me to not skip on my education because it would make me look good on college and job applications if I never called out sick for school. I just explained this just to give a little bit of context. Now onto the story where I nearly died.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly had forgotten what month this happened it but it was my freshman year of highschool ( being 13 years old in 2010 )when I joined the cross country team. The weather was starting to get into the 60s F (so maybe it was it was around April?) I had gotten sick early in the month shortly before one of cross country races. My coach allowed me to not run BUT I was required to still go to the meet and cheer on my team, so I was out on the field in 50 degree weather in a pair of our team's tanktop and short pants. My mom complained about be sitting out of the race (though she never came to these races) but agreed it was good to not let me run because it would be embarrassing. However due to whatever this stupid cold was and constantly having to go out in the cold multiple times for cross country  made this minor cold last for 2 weeks. After those two weeks I started to get better, then nearly one week later I started to know something was wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

My coughs came back and were more harsh then they were before, at times to the point where I sat/ kneeled not only because of how violent they were and was barely able to get air in, and I was suffering from fever that wouldn't go away.  I begged my mother to do something about it since after only about 3 or 4 days my throat was felt like it was on fire, my lungs were in so much pain, my head felt like it was about to explode and I started to feel cold though I knew I had a fever. However my mom thought it was another cold I ""purposefully"" caught by not being careful enough at school and it would just go away if she just kept giving me cold medicine everyday. I told her that the medicine she kept giving me wasn't working,  nothing made the pain go away but because she earned a nursing CERTIFICATE, NOT A DEGREE in nursing 20 years before I was born, so I wasn't allow to question her sound logic of just stuffing me with pills. Though I had only taken around 3 days off after nearly a month of being sick, it all changed when I was forced back to school after the 3rd.

&amp;#x200B;

I woke telling my mom I felt worse than ever, shivering in my sleep, my body feeling so cold even though I had 3 huge winter blankets on me during the night that was in the 50s. However my mother refused to let me skip another day of school, and since she worked at my school as a cafeteria lady she would know if I cut school. I went to school and I'll be honest at this point I was barely conscious, I remember my vision was fading on occasion throughout the day. Then I got to gym class, my gym teachers wouldn't let me sit out so all my working out made everything felt worse. After the gym I went to the nurses office, I could barely even stand and asked them to check me out. After they did, they told me I needed to go to a hospital, so they quarantine me to the bed at the corner of the room as they called my mother to pick me up. My bitch of a mother came into the room and said to me **""oh sweetie, why didn't you tell me you were sick?""** and she went to talk to the nurses saying that I was completely fine this morning or at least acted like it. They told her I needed to be taken to the hospital right away, so we waited for my dad to pick us up. However my mom when she got into the car DEMANDED WE GO HOME INSTEAD. Before getting into that damn car, she made it out to everyone that I was hiding my sickness because ""of my determination for my education.""

&amp;#x200B;

My mother took me home and covered me in winter blankets and told me ""we have to wait for our appointment at the ER."" I was barely even there mentally, i just sat there shaking, clutching myself and coughing so much I thought I was going to start coughing up blood. She kept me home for 2 HOURS, because she wanted to see if my fever would go down on its own. After my fever did go down  according to my mother from number the nurses told her, and that's when I first saw what my temperature was. **106.3 F,** my mom after that took me to the hospital and acted as if she was ll in a panic over me, which everyone believed. I don't remember much but I did remember the doctor stating that it was good i arrived ""before it was too late"" which I assumed the worst.  I was told I needed medicine they would prescribed because I had gotten ""a bad case of the flu"" and I think was sent home the same day, I say I think because the only thing I remember after going to the hospital was my dog putting his cold nose on my face while watching a movie at home a few days later. I was out of school for almost 2 weeks, and yet I still remember a few times where my mom wasn't worrying if I was getting better, but was worrying about what rumors were going on about me at school because I was gone for more than a day.

&amp;#x200B;

That entire time I had to deal with so much bullshit, it was honestly the scariest thing in my life, for a while when I got sick I would joke saying it felt like I was dying, now I really don't joke about it. The worst part was when I had to fucking go back to school even though I wasn't 100% recovered. My mother had pretty much convinced the school staff, both the normal and cafeteria staff that I pushed myself too hard, that I should have let my family know how bad I was feeling. Some of the teachers tried to spin it as a lesson for me to not lie and some teachers after that never believed me about anything I said, stating I'm a pretty good liar if I could pretend for that long without anyone noticing. Back then I didn't know why mom was so obsessed with my appearance at school the reputation I would give for not being there for one day and why she lied through her fucking teeth about not knowing I was ill. I now know she is a narc who only wanted me to look good so she looks good, however due to her sending me to school, she threw me under the bus so I would get all of the blame and ""endangering students with the flu"" because she didn't want to look like a bad parent.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess part of me just wanted to get this off my chest since I keep having flash backs to it when I get sick. Just though I could talk about it now since for whatever reason its been stuck in my mind recently though I haven't been sick.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:

I caught the flu somehow after being sick with something else and my mother refused to let me get treated because she rather me have a good reputation of being a punctual student rather then let me stay home. And when it got out how bad my sickness was, she did everything in her power to make it look like I pretended to NOT be sick so I could continue my education and that she knew nothing about my condition so she doesn't look like she's at fault.",JUSTNOMIL
"A bit long. TL:DR at the end. 

For some quick backstory, I got my cat when she was a kitten and we’ve grown together. She’s now 18 years old. 

She’s very healthy. Deaf, minor arthritis, tartare on her teeth, started losing claws and bleeding from it (of which we will be seeing a vet for). 

An XSO and I got a cat a while ago and they researched the fuck out of it and let me know why decisions were made (to include me and he was excited about all the new info). 

We learnt a lot. 

Like the fact that cheap brands of food tend to have a lot of salt in them which makes them addictive to cats, making it harder to change them over to healthier, less salty foods (ie more expensive foods)

Up until about a year ago my cat lived with my parents (and was strictly outdoors only... on a busy road). 

I moved in with my BF to a little unit that allows cats so we’d decided to take her in; she is my cat after all. 

We’d also decided to finish off what food she had left over from what they’d been feeding her (very VERY cheap food) then we’d move on to a much healthier food. 

By the time we managed the change (we’d had her a couple months now. There was a lot of food and she didn’t eat much) we’d gotten another cat as well. 

He is a fat cat. We got him like that. He’s been on a diet and it’s been successful for him. 

I digress. 

Biscuits for an old cat, biscuits for a fat cat, wet food for all cats. They were happy. 

Not JNSMum. 

She kept telling us how old cat was fine on her old food and it’s such a waste of money and that she’s so healthy even on ‘that diet’ after I’d mention the upgrade in food or that she was much healthier now. 

She wasn’t having a bar of it. 

So a month or two ago old cat had to go to the vet and we got her treated for it. Another health check. Same results. Healthy. 

I remembered to ask about the food so I actually had the word of a vet telling me with BF as a witness. 

She told me exactly what I already knew. 

While it’s okay if cats eat the unhealthier foods when they’re young, she preferred old cat be on food specifically for her as it was designed FOR old cats and so much healthier (much more was said and some was technical jargon, I can’t remember exactly). 

Next time we see my parents I mention old cat at the vet and I think she asked what the vet said. 

It couldn’t have been a better set up. 

I immediately told her what the VET had told me about old cat and her food. 

I did lie and say that the vet told us she COULDN’T be on the cheap food anymore due to her age. 

That. Shut. Her. Up. 

Oh my god! I couldn’t be happier. 

Now I have the ammunition of the vet’s words against hers should she ever bring it up again (she hasn’t so far). 

My spine was so shiny in that moment. 

I didn’t even need BF to have my back or anything. I am proud of that moment. 

TL:DR: JNSMum insists old cat should be on cheap food still as she is ‘so healthy’ on it. Get vet to tell me she shouldn’t stay on it. Throw vet’s words in JNSMum’s face. Shut her down.

Edit: Old cat is a lady cat, Fat cat is a hungry boy.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hello. I was pointed here by a coworker, I don't use reddit much and blah blah, point being, I've spent like an hour reading the rules, looking at other posts, etc. and I'm fairly certain I'm doing everything right. Mods let me know if I'm not and I'll change whatever. I'm not gonna use many acronyms because they confuse the everloving hell out of me, truly sorry if that makes it longer or harder to read or whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my wife (both 30 y/o) just had our first baby in January. This is the first grandchild on both sides. Since me and my wife got married 8 years ago, my MIL (and honestly my FIL too) have been *pestering* us about ""when are you gonna have babies,"" etc. Even while we were engaged, we'd get ""you'd make such beautiful babies together!"" from her. My wife is the oldest of 4 siblings for context, and my MIL gave birth to my wife at like 35, so she's kind of old to be a first time grandma and was dying for it. She and my FIL have both told us repeatedly that my MIL's dream / life goal is to retire from her receptionist job and spend the rest of her life taking care of the grandbabies. Seems strange to me, but this woman seems born to take care of kids, it seems to be a true passion.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to get too much into old stuff, but she would constantly do shit like ask my wife when she was gonna stop taking birth control, get really nosy and personal. My wife didn't ever seem to mind or think it was anything other than just something to roll your eyes at. It always kinda seemed very off to me, but it's my wife's body and if she's comfortable being pestered about it or whatever, that's up to her. Plus it's her mother. So not my business, as it would only sometimes put my wife in a bad mood, but then she'd get over it fairly quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

When we finally decided we wanted kids, we had a hard time conceiving, so having MIL constantly on us about having babies sucked, because she KNEW that we were struggling. She made passive aggressive comments like ""if only you had started trying earlier, you might have a baby by now."" But whatever, we ended up getting pregnant. We were so fucking excited!!!

&amp;#x200B;

When we told them, we thought they were going to do the whole YouTube reactions thing that you see online, with the crying and the cheering and basically losing their shit. But my MIL was like, ""oh, yay, sweetie! That's exciting..."" in like the blandest tone. My FIL was on his way out the door when we called and kinda shouted ""congrats!"" as he casually walked by in the background. You'd think we would've told them we found the keys to the car or something.

&amp;#x200B;

Like, wtf!? You've been pestering us about it for so long and now they seem upset they got their wish? It was really strange and we still don't know what to think about that. During the entire pregnancy, she was like that. She seemed to get really quiet and squeeze-lipped whenever we talked about the baby, which to be fair was a majority of what we talked about. It wasn't like she just seemed neutral about the pregnancy and pending grandchild, it was like she was apathetic with a side of passive aggression. Once when we told everyone we'd be having a boy, she rolled her eyes and I overheard her say to my wife's little sister that she was hoping for a girl. Why did she suddenly seem so annoyed and over it when she was constantly badgering us to have a kid?!

&amp;#x200B;

Another bit of context that's important, my wife's family are kind of weirdly obsessed with and proud of their last name. They're the kind that are like, ""oh, he's a \[Wife'sMaidenName\], that's why,"" when explaining great accomplishments or behaviors from family members. My wife is that way too a little, and almost didn't change her last name when we got married which would've been fine, but she eventually decided she wanted to and so she did.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife figured a way to get my MIL excited about the baby was to let her know that a major name in the running for our son was \[MaidenName\]. But that utterly backfired. My MIL was like taken aback, and said it would feel weird to call a baby by a last name, and then sent us different baby name lists at least once a week.

&amp;#x200B;

Right before he was born, we decided that we would indeed go with \[MaidenName/SonsName\], and got a really short ""...ok"" kind of text from my MIL. We got some texts about it from my wife's other siblings before we told them, so I know MIL was talking to them about it. The other texts seemed politely excited, not like actually excited, you know?

&amp;#x200B;

Then MIL couldn't make it to the birth, (but came a week after with seemingly none of the work problems she had used as excuses to miss the birth, after my family and our friends started blowing up social media with photos). Even then she was oddly uninterested in our new son. And the entire time she was here and even since she left, she always calls our son (her first grandchild that she so desperately wanted, btw) Baby. Occasionally she calls him Baby \[OurLastName\]. At first it was cute and seemed endearing, but after so much time she still has yet to call him \[SonsName\]. She makes it sound like he's unnamed.

&amp;#x200B;

We figured she just had to get used to calling him \[SonsName\]. I get it can be weird to call a baby by your own last name. But it's been 5 months and she sent him some little outfit and addressed it to ""the baby."" I have literally never heard her use his name. The closest she got was calling him ""Baby \[SonsName\]ie-poo-boy,"" which, I know.... But even that was only once. I'm beginning to get more uncomfortable with this. My wife thinks my MIL just needs to get used to it still, but I'm wondering how she's ever going to get used to it if she won't use it in the first place? I don't want to overstep because this is my wife and my wife's mother. But I can tell it bothers her, and all of this hurts her feelings. One time I said ""why don't you ever call him \[SonsName\]?"", my MIL kind of laughed and said something about it just being baby talk. I tried to talk to my wife and she says she'll say something if he's one or two and MIL is still calling him ""baby."" But I just don't know.",JUSTNOMIL
"QM is my mother.

QM means Queen Mother but, I am starting to think Twat waffle would suit her better.

The day before I had brought home some annual bulbs that I love and thought it be a nice little surprise for QM. I planted them by the same species of plant as the ones we have after work before I lost the sun. They are purple and the bulbs I planted are yellow. There was a bald spot beside the purple one and I thought the colours beside each other would be complementary. (I actually put a little thought into this ya know)

My morning started as per usual. I wake up and wonder into the kitchen for eggs and toast making. QM is having trouble with an application on her tablet so I fix it for her. Would you look at that. This app lets you take a picture of a plant and it will tell you the name and how to take care of it.

Perfect I think. We both go outside to let the pups out and I show her my handy work.

She started screaming at me......Why did you plant them there!?

Why didn't you plant them over there and of course a bunch more garbage hate bullshit. I just leave her there and go back inside to cook myself breaky and prep my lunch.

She comes back in the kitchen then promptly starts bitching about the state of the kitchen. How messy and disgusting it is. At this point I bite. You mean the pan I am using or the cutting board I am currently using? Or the dishes that you and Whitey left in the sink?

Que her externally shrieking while I am internally shrieking. I just watch her adult tantrum while nibbling my toast.

"I’ve posted bits and pieces about my JNMIL. After a lot of digging into what she’s been doing to me and ultimately her son (my hubby) we’ve come to the conclusion that she is a covert narcissist on the less extreme side of the scale. She plays the victim card with everything. Yes, she’s lived a tough life but she’s never taken responsibility for her own healing. 

************************************TLDR: My MIL is a Narcissist. Hubby and I are limited contact for now. Hubby is struggling with the realization his mom is horrible. I’m struggling with the fact that I’m hurting from her bullshit when I want to just play tough. Any advice on handling the hurt?************************************


I started dating my hubby when I was 15. So his mom has been a big part of the last 9 years of my life! She and I did a lot together. My parents were processing through some tough decisions that they made and had to deal with so my MIL was a person I turned to for everything back then. She loved me and welcomed me into the family from the very start. I loved every minute of it. 

She and I would go up to my hubby’s college the two years before I ended up there (I’m two grades younger than him). We’d chat the whole hour up and the whole hour back home. We did this probably 20 times, if not more over those years. I never thought anything about it. 

Fast forward to 6mos before my wedding. Hubby and I had been together 7 1/2 years. Mil starts digging in about weird things and basically forced me to have a “real wedding “. She was weird about everything all of a sudden. My family did this. I did that. Nobody appreciates the work she’s putting in. Her baby is leaving her. Blah, blah, blah. 

Here we are, married two years, both teachers in a school attached to a church (lots of outside of school-day commitment) and she still feels entitled to us. The last two years, after moving an hour away and getting really time invested jobs, she gets mad when we put my hubby’s job (music in the church service) before seeing her. I also noticed he wasn’t going to see her when we are in the area to see my parents. 

IT TURNS OUT OF HE WENT HOME TO SEE HER SHE WOULD BITCH ABOHT ME AND EVERYTHING THE WHOLE TIME!!! She was making herself a martyr over her son and I growing up, getting our degrees, getting jobs, and moving out. We did what every balanced parents wants from their kids! 

Then, last Christmas, She was butthurt that I told her she can’t give any children I have (that I may never physically be able to have) more than 3 small Christmas gifts when I saw that she spent $2000 on her other son’s 3 yr old kid. 🙄 Not. 👏🏻 In. 👏🏻 My. 👏🏻 House.👏🏻

So since arguing with her at Christmas, I’ve cut myself off. In April, she, my hubby and I got into a text debate. I’m very thankful to have every backhanded, twisted, and manipulative thing she said in writing while I said nothing stupid or regrettable. She’s so hurt, how dare us for being terrible, word twisting, it’s about her. This confirmed the Narc assumption we now have. 

We told her that we want limited contact until she agrees to meet with us in her pastor’s office. (He married is and was our childhood pastor). She’s refused, so far. 

We had a wedding to go to that she went to as well. I ended up having a full blown anxiety attack that also manifested into physics symptoms. I was in denial about her power over me, emotionally. I realized the hurt that I felt while pretending I didn’t have any. So we didn’t make the wedding. 

SHE TEXTED MY HUSBAND AND MADE THE WEDDING ABOUT HER! She was again the self made martyr because she apologized for us treating everyone terribly and offered to pay for our plates that we abandoned. 

I’m just so done with her. I’ve been an emotional wreck. I don’t want to be. I feel so lied to. I went to her with personal issues like my reproductive health and mental health and now she uses them as ways to mock me or shame me. She has never been supportive of us as a married unit or a unit at all if she isn’t included. She holds grudges with everything. I want her out of my life and out of my hubby’s guilt strings but I also want to do it right for the sake of the few family members that we don’t think are her flying monkeys. 

I so deeply wish I hadn’t fallen for her bullshit. She has tried to hold her own excessive generosity that I never asked for over my head (even stuff 5+ years ago). I don’t feel guilty for things that she offered to me or upscaled whatever I did ask for. That was her choice. It does upset me to no end that my husband, who was seeing his mom and this nice, caring but kookie woman has to process that she is just shy of evil. 

It breaks my heart that my husband has to go through a second parent turning out to be a horrible human being. I walked through a similar journey as a child when my dad’s dad passed away and his mother became unbalanced and he went no contact. My dad ended up with some major issues the 6 or so years following (drinking in excess, the occasional muscle relaxer). The woman that I should call grandmother did despicable and illegal things that cause the separation. It never crossed my mind that I would be walking that journey too. 

God bless you if you are still here! 

Any advice on how to deal with the hurt? I’m just so fed up and exhausted. 😒",JUSTNOMIL
"So we are over half way into our second baby and they have told us twice now it’s a girl, so we are thinking of names and it made me remember when we were pregnant with DS that Susan tried inserting names for us to use..specifically FILs name as the middle name. She kept on and on about it until I said back one day saying I was going to use my Dad’s name as middle name. 

Now my Dad passed away from bowel cancer in 2012 so it was important for me to feel like DS had a close connection to his Pop he would never meet, OH had no problem with it and agreed. It wasn’t until we ended up going NC after the sickness incident I really lost my shit and screamed at FIL over the phone for being a FM for Susan. 

He rang and I could clearly hear her standing next to him on the phone telling him what to say, and she mentioned about only joking about using FILs name as DS middle name because on my book of faces post I put all of their behaviour on show including the “joking/insisting” of said name issue on blast. So I let loose saying there was no way I would ever use FIL’s name, because FILs Oldest Son from previous marriage had his name for a middle name, well things went so silent I could hear the sour CBF over the phone before I heard Susan hissing at FIL to just hang up the phone before the kids could hear what I was saying.

"Greetings!

It's been awhile. Thankfully. Today I am back because my grandmother in law (GMIL) has lost all privileges of babysitting our kids. I'm at a loss, since it means it really puts me in a tight spot for childcare, but my husband has made the choice, and we'll figure it out.

Allow me to set the scene.....

It's been over two years since our fallout with Gem (my MIL) and it's been nice. GMIL has had a few time outs, but had recently pretty much gained trust back and I really needed a sitter a few days for various work reasons.

I had noticed my kids bringing some random things up dealing with Gem, but I couldn't absolutely prove it was coming from GMIL. Until a few days ago.

Early in the week she watched the kids. Later in the week I had the kids and had to drive in an area we don't go much- in part because Gem lives there. The oldest kid falls apart. Screaming at me about how mean I am to not go see grandma. Wait... What? This is new.

I finally, calmly, got the kid to chill out and tell me what was up. ""(GMIL) said you and Daddy are just mean and won't let us see (Gem!) Why Momma!? Why are you so mean to (Gem!)""

My blood was on fire. I couldn't believe someone would do this and put small kids in a position to have to have to deal with very adult situations. Until this point we had never spoken badly to the kids about Gem. But my hand was forced. I also added why it's important to not hurt people, yadda yadda gentle life lesson.

I hope my explanation was okay, it was simple really, that Gem made the choice to be really mean to Mommy and Daddy and Gem wouldn't apologize about it. We all are allowed to make the choice to have nice people in our lives, and that's what we did.

My husband told me later Gem had text him recently- surprise! It was a lot of ""I don't understand why you are doing this to me! How can you be so mean to your mother! I didn't do anything!"" 

I'm not even mad at Gem anymore, I find it funny she's gone over two years still refusing to just say ANY type of apology or acknowledgement of her actions and still plays victim. My husband has said to her from day one that we (he and her) can't move past the situation until she acknowledges her actions. She still hasn't, and I applaud him for standing his ground. 

Soon we have to tell GMIL that she's banned from watching the kids. Which she'll also play dumb. She too, never owned her manipulative actions, but I got over it eventually since it was more about me. This time she messed with my kids. You. Don't. Mess. With. My. Kids.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi all. I've not shared my story here before, but I have touched at it. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mother is crazy. She's even come to the subs here to complain about me, ask how to have me mentally committed, said I was missing and how to find me, etc. (we Shall call her Susan. Not her real name).

&amp;#x200B;

To sum things up (it's a very intricate story, but I will touch at it a bit), I moved at 14 in with my dad because I was tired of the control. Basically a life of being told I was too fat, not popular enough, a nerd or geek for enjoying books, being grounded from reading, being screamed at for not knowing how to clean to her standards yet never being taught. I was permanently on a low carb diet (I have ARFID so this made my life hell) and lived off of a hamburger patty a day during the summer when I was stuck at her house. All my important teenage events are riddled with her: her telling me I'm too fat for my prom dress, surprised I made cheerleader, because fat and not popular, etc. Throwing a fit about not letting me go to an out of state college because ""you can't leave me"". Find out later, this was because our current state had an age of majority to encourage her control till 21. I married an abusive boyfriend at 18 to escape the control. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went through periods of ""cut off"", then let her back in. She was back ""in"" when I was pregnant with my first child. She threw a fit if I didn't let her in EVERY doctor's appt. Threw a screaming fit in our doctor's office because I asked for my anatomy ultrasound to be just me and my husband. Threw a screaming fit because I asked for her not to come to an ultrasound to allow my aunt (who was more of a mom in my teen years than her) to come to just one. Whined and cried because I didn't kick my husband out of my c-section to let her in. Called my OB a quack for saying I needed a CSECTION because she ""wanted me to feel what labor felt like"". Told me if she saw me taking my pain medicine she'd call CPS on me. Tried to throw them away. Whined and cried because my husband wouldn't ""go home"" and let her sleep at the hospital. 

&amp;#x200B;

Told me that she was coming to stay with me for a week after I got home (and I agreed) and that I could cancel other family coming to help. Told my husband and I on the first night she'd watch the baby and we could sleep, don't worry about her or the baby.. Woke up the next morning to 18 passive aggressive texts, her throwing my newborn at me, and leaving and not coming back because ""we closed the bedroom door and left her with the baby??""

&amp;#x200B;

Tons of boundary stomps, like trying to potty train my 7 month old by putting her on the potty and pouring cold water between her legs. Always in our business. Always crying if she didn't get her way. (there's a ton more but anyway).

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up after a dramatic funeral episode when her sister died when my oldest was 1.5 and realized she was grooming her and i didn't want that in my life, so I cut her off, hoping she'd change. (Nov 2015.) I did let her know that I was pregnant with #2, not to tell anyone, but I was letting her know as a courtesy, she told anyone and everyone then whined later that I'd ""announced on facebook"" before I told her though I had screenshots to show her that I'd told her a solid 2 months before. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, she didn't get any details on my pregnancy. I was a couple of months along when the doctor's office told me I couldn't see them anymore unless I submitted all my insurances. I said what insurance? I did have all mine on file. Nope. Using the ACA, she'd put me back on her insurance and was getting my EOBs (at 24 years old!) which told her which doc I was seeing, what medicines I was taking, etc. I tried to get off, couldn't unless the holder signed me off (my stepdad). He refused because he's scared of her too. Filed with EVERYONE IMAGINABLE to be taken off, nope. Would ride it out till I was 26 and aged off, or he signed me off. She'd send emails and texts about how I didn't need to be taking this medicine or this medicine. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, when my silence remained for months... She called CPS on me. I was 36 ish weeks pregnant and it threw me into labor. She told them I was neglecting and beating my children. They only visited once with that call and closed it immediately, but it's heart stopping. 

&amp;#x200B;

To try and shorten a long story, the past almost 4 years have been riddled with craziness. I still haven't talked to her. We've moved far, far away. She's called the sheriff for welfare checks (to my old house). She's continued to call CPS. She's made ""missing"" posts on our local BST pages and has posted on DWIl and here on reddit. She's tried to have me mentally committed. She's posted in a fellow LEO wife page asking the LEO wives to have their husbands ""run me"" to find where I am. She's tried to sue for GPRs. She called the company we bought my husband's 4 wheeler from and told them ""we didn't need that, come get it"". She's had people take pictures of my grocery cart and sent me emails about my toilet paper and drink choices being stupid. She's complained about everything from my weight, to the car I drive, and constantly about how much $$ she thinks I spend. 

&amp;#x200B;

I now have three children. She's never met the younger two and will NEVER meet them or any further children. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure I'll share future stories. Just felt like venting.

"We got into another argument on my way back home from a friend's house. She acted so sweet in front of them and gave them gifts, but when we got in the car, she immediately started picking a fight with me.

She just asked mundane questions at first, like what we did or what I ate. I didn't ignore her. I answered her. I tried to act boring and uninteresting so she would leave me alone, but she got upset and started yelling that I never wanted to talk to her. It's true, I don't, and I told her. I told her that I never want to talk to her because she always yells at me, and she just yelled back that she wasn't yelling at me.

She said that I'll never get my way because she's my mother and she can do whatever she wants. She said that JYF was stupid to support me with this whole court situation, and that I don't know how much I'll regret it if I never saw her again. She called JYF incompetent and said that he had no idea how to parent me. She told me that I can't take care of myself without her. She told me that she hates being around me because of my attitude. She told me that I was ungrateful for everything she did for me.

She told me that she hoped that when I had kids, they would treat me the same way I treated her. I told her that I'd actually treat my kids with respect and raise them better than she raised me, and she scoffed at me. She said to me, ""Where are you going to learn that from? Your *dad*?""

I cried, but I could take it. She's said all these things to me before. I think she crossed another line today though.

She said that no matter what the judge says, since he'll make a ruling on the 15th to see who I'll be with during the summer, she'll still control me. She said she'll always be able to control me, even if I never see her again. I don't want to be controlled by her anymore. Why don't I get to be my own person?

And she had the fucking nerve to tell me that *I* got good grades this year because of *her*. She said that the only reason I passed any of my classes this year was because she pushed me to. I think this is the worst thing she's ever said to me. I don't know why it hurts me so much.

*I* was the one who sat in those classes. *I* was the one who took those tests. *I* was the one who stayed up until midnight to put the finishing touches on projects because I wanted the highest scores I could get. *I* was the one who had to try to fix problem after problem I had with my teachers because she was unwilling to help me at all. *I* was the one who had to beg my school counselors to let me into therapy because of how much she had hurt me. I worked so hard all year to get all A's. I pushed myself to be the best that I could be because I want to be happy some day.

But it was all her. She kept repeating, ""You're welcome."" That's all she would say to me, no matter how much I cried that *I did it myself*. I wanted to scream at her but all I could do was cry. I wish I could stop crying.

I don't know what to do anymore. I just want a hug from my dad


Edit:

We just had a discussion. When I was bringing up things that she had done to me, I mentioned one time where she had made me cry before dropping me off with my dad, and then called him to tell him to ignore me crying. She denied that it ever happened. She kept trying to guilt me too. When I mentioned that my dad was coming with his copy of the court order to pick me up, she said, ""But oh, won't he get in trouble? You don't want him to get in trouble, do you?"" I know damn well she doesn't care if he gets in trouble. 

She said she wanted to try to work things out with me, but never really admitted to being wrong about anything. She said sorry a few times, but it didn't really seem genuine. I said that I needed space away from her. She refused at first, then said I could stay with my dad for only the night, then took it back when I said that I was done talking to her. 

I'm so tired.",JUSTNOMIL
"I've also posted to r/justnofamily, but this is mostly for MIL so posting it here too.

I'm conflicted about something that is coming up. There was a death of a beloved relative of my MIL in the fall, that my DH was also close to growing up. Her and FIL postponed any Celebration of Life/ashes spreading until we were available and could attend, which would be this summer. They specifically want us there, so planned the event in conjunction with our schedule. That's not the issue though.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a two-day event, first day is the Celebration of Life, and the second day is a float on a local river in which they will spread his ashes. We will obviously be at the first day Celebration. The ashes spreading on flowing water was the deceased person's request, while the float is the preference of MIL/FIL. For various reasons, I have no desire to go floating on the river with them. It would be no issue with me if they were to do a whole ashes spreading on the bank of the river, etc. But I am cringing at the thought of having to be half-naked (and them too) and stuck on a tube/boat for hours with them while my MIL will be undoubtedly be weepy and processing her emotions wholeheartedly and trying to get emotional fulfillment and closure with us in this way.

&amp;#x200B;

If it was just a regular float, I'd have no issue in asserting that we won't be able to join, as they go floating every year. But this feels different being a death in the family. We've been better about setting boundaries, not sharing or participating in things we don't wish to, but this one I feel stuck on. I want to support my DH and be there for him too, as he was close to this person and has no problem with going. He understands my hesitation but doesn't have a good solution either. I feel 60% like I have to go, suck it up, buy a rash-guard shirt/cover ups, etc., and 40% like no, I'll already have attended the Celebration of Life and been there for them that way. If I go, I know I'll be quiet and uncomfortable. If I don't, it'll probably be very offensive and seen as a snub or something.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, is there ever specific times where it's appropriate to cross personal boundaries and go against personal wants? What would you do if you were me? What would you say?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit to add: If I don't go to the float, DH would still go without me. He would want me there, but wouldn't force the issue.",JUSTNOMIL
"K as the title says, this is my first post.  I have quite a few problems with my MIL and ILs in general but I don’t have time to go into it fully at the moment so to the point: 
We live an hour out of a city that my ILs live.  We came into town and normally stay at their house overnight Friday and sometimes Saturday.  Yesterday she told us we have to go to Toys R’ Us and have our 15 month old daughter help pick out a ride-along toy because my mom got one for her at their house and it just can’t happen that my mom has something theirs doesn’t.  

MIL catches me off guard and asks if she can take my 15 month old to her friend’s first birthday tomorrow.  MIL has a ton of nurse friends (she’s a nurse) that are 15-20 years younger than her.  I’m speechless and don’t want this to happen as MIL seems to love to “play mommy” with my daughter and takes that more seriously than her comfort.  My LO has not spent much time with other kids due to us being in a small town and any time she has she looks to me for reassurance, MIL knows my LO is EXTREMELY attached to me and is always “mama mama mama” and won’t stop crying if I’m not there.  

DH immediately says yes.  I’m like “um...”.  She goes “what, I can’t take her?”  Sounding VERY hurt.  I say that I’m worried how she’ll do because she always looks to me and hasn’t had a lot of interaction with other kids.  She brushes off my concerns as she always does.  Decision made.  I talk to my husband later how uncomfortable I am with this, he says it’ll be good for her and it’s perfectly normal of MILs to do this. 

So it’s the day of her friend’s baby’s birthday and as I thought was going to happen, MIL buy her a dress to dress her up.  Shoes, she does her hair.  DH and I have to run an errand so we’re gone as they leave.  She said she’d be gone for an hour at the absolute most.  It’s been over an hour and a half and I’m sitting here at their house.  

While DH and I run an errand I break down crying because I’m sick of her “playing mommy” and being so controlling.  This is just one thing of many many many many things that I wish I could write here (short list: she grabs the stroller from me, she always has to carry her, she always feeds her when I’ve already said she’s not hungry, she comes up with excuses to change her clothes, she showed up to her birth in full glam makeup while I looked like sh*t and posted pics on Facebook despite me saying I looked bad and wanted her to take them down, she threw me a baby shower AFTER the baby was born which I didn’t want and protested against and almost broke my relationship with fights about with DH so she could show off the baby to her friends, she calls LO “my baby” “my girl”, always acts as though I’ve dressed her inappropriately for the weather, SIL will ask MIL if she can hold MY daughter instead of me or do things with her, wow this ended up not being a short list my bad there’s more I’ll end here).  DH reiterates there’s nothing wrong with his mom bringing her but if I want we can come up with an excuse not to let her do this more as she has many many young mom friends and there will be more birthdays.  

Would you have a problem with this?  If so, what kind of an excuse can I say?

Edit: she’s now taken her to the grocery store without permission because of course she wouldn’t miss an opportunity.  Thank you for responses so far it is very very appreciated, I just doubt myself all the time if I ever have a right to be upset.",JUSTNOMIL
"She is so weird with food. 

Just today Hubby is like she is smothering me with her food.  

He went to pick up something from his dad she had his dinner made and packed. Did not even ask him. Just put it in the car. 

He has been on a diet for 6 months cause he wants to maintain his 6 pack. If it doesn't fit his macros he wont eat it. He is super strict. 

 He tells her this and she ignore him.

Her food doesn’t fit his macros. 

 If he doesn't take her food she pouts and is passive aggressive. Or she will sneak out and put it in our car. Or she will try and trick me into taking it if I am their. 

 But I have learned to turn around and just ask Hubby. Do you want this? 

(Next time she does that to me I will call her out on it and how rude it is to do to me.)

Sometimes she will come over and try to put food into our fridge and I will catch her and tell her no take it back. Then catch her trying to sneak it in the fridge again as soon as my back is turned. I just take it out of the fridge and send it all home with her. 

And then she mutters in greek passive aggressive BS. 

Do you know how much food we throw out? 

My husband and I cook so we eat our food, it fits our macros we are both on low carb, moderate fat, moderate protine diets and I'm allergic to dairy.

 (Except when I was pregnant it was so nice I craved milk and gelato all day and could eat it the only good thing about being pregnant)

 Her food Does not fit those macros. I rarely eat her food. She is not a bad cook she just has 1 flavor profile and while it may be nutritious it does not fit my macros or my dietary needs.

Hubby won’t eat her food even though he likes her cooking because it’s high in fat. 

The other unwanted stuff she leave at our house I just donate. But food I can not donate.  If its meat or fish we give it to the stray cats. 

But a-lot of it is dairy and veggies. 

I asked him and I was like well how do you want to deal with it? 
He is like the unwanted stuff lets just donate and be done. 

Which is fine but really it’s avoiding the issue. 

The food? 

It is a battle every-time we see her. And honestly annoying as fuck. 

 He is like shes old and wont change which is true but he is reaching a breaking point with her and then he will tell her off in a big way. 

He has before its a cycle they smoother he just places restrictions for awhile, then they behave and repeat.  

I am no longer his buffer and its NICE. 

Now her (baby’s) name day and her 1/2 birthday are coming up Now if that women thinks she is cooking she is INSANE. 

He is having lunch with them tomorrow and he can invite them over for the name day BUT he has to make clear that we are cooking and she is NOT to bring ANYTHING. 

He also has to tell her cooking in my kitchen is closed as off now cause she likes to come over and just start cooking. So weird. 


She is going to show up with food anyways. So annoying. I need him to be like take it back on the spot. It’s the only way she will listen. Will he? Who knows.",JUSTNOMIL
"TLDR: MIL told FDH’s Ex Fiancé that I was pregnant TWO DAYS AFTER WE FOUND OUT then proceeded to try to guilt trip us and play victim to my mother, his best friend, and SIL. We have gone VLC/NC with her until further notice. 


My MIL is still best friends with my FDH’s EX Fiancé that cheated on him. EX was over at MIL’s house TWO DAYS after we found out I was pregnant and told MIL. We told MIL that it was not public knowledge cause I’m still in my first trimester and am waiting till the second to let everyone other than close friends and family know. SHE TOLD HIS EX I WAS PREGNANT. THEN PROCEEDED TO CALL AND TEXT EVERYONE(my mother, his best friend, SIL, etc) AND TELL THEM WE BANNED HER FROM BEING A GRANDMA. We told her she wasn’t in charge of the baby shower anymore because she decided her excitement was more important than our boundaries 🙃 I even texted her and told her she will still be my child’s grandma but she’s on a baby info diet. SHE CALLED EVERYONE AFTER MY TEXT. She tried to guilt trip FDH and say “well it’s my life too! Can I not be excited?!!!” Like yeah bitch you can be excited, we let you blab to your best friend that I don’t know cause you were so excited. BUT NO YOU DO NOT GET TO TELL HIS EX FIANCÉ ABOUT OUR LIVES AND NOT EXPECT CONSEQUENCES. I’m currently NC with her, FDH is very LC almost NC at the moment as well. I’m honestly just blown away by the level of disrespect and guilt tripping she tried to pull on us. I’m extremely proud of my FDH for sticking up to her, He did most of the yelling and telling her she won’t be throwing the baby shower anymore. 

Note: I didn’t want to tell her this early but I told both of my parents the day we found out so I didn’t want to tell FDH he couldnt tell his mom. We told her the morning after we found out.",JUSTNOMIL
"Alright. This is going to be a really long post, and needs backstory to make sense. I am shaking and freaking out and have no idea how to handle this. Any advice would be great, thank you. 

Names:

EH: Ex husband

EHW: Ex husband's wife

EHWM: ex husband's wife's mother (and father included in this shit duo)

DD: Dear Daughter

&amp;#x200B;

So, in 2010, I was married and had a daughter with my now ex husband. Struggling with mental illness and heading for a breakdown, I ended up losing custody to him after we divorced. At first I was upset about this (of course!) but I realized it was better for our daughter. It took a few years and a lot of bullshit, but I finally got better (borderline personality disorder manifesting as disassociative bipolar). I kept in touch with EH off and on. He gave me updates. He has full custody, and I have something like partial legal custody. I miss my daughter, but she has been through so much in her life. She deserves stability and normalcy. EH makes good money and she is surrounded by family. She is 9 now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anywho, when EH and I divorced in 2010, one thing that made me push for it was he was cheating on me. This woman he was cheating on me with became EHW. Yes, I am kinda salty about that but it is whatever. She was... kinda good with DD. Not abusive. She comes from money and is very spoiled. Her parents, EHWM, spoil DD. At first when EH told me about it, I thought it was great. EH drives truck and is gone for a few days at a time. I was happy she had family like that who could take care of her and that adored her. I tried very hard to keep my emotions out of it, and just thought of what was best for DD. They were giving her a life that I never could. Me and EH talked about at some point me being in DD's life again. We decided that with everything she has been through, waiting until she is old enough to have things explained to her so she understood, and let her make a decision about being in my life, would be best. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, the last year of conversations with EH, he was talking to me about stuff. They were getting divorced. EHW was just too selfish and spoiled. She would spend all of his money. When he would go on the road, she would drop DD off at EHWM's for a week at a time, or more. They got divorced, and she was gone from DD's life. EHW didn't even care, she just went on with her life, living at home with her rich parents until they bought her her own condo. They pay for her private college and she gets a monthly allowance for shopping. Yeah, those kinds of people. EHWM has been watching DD for EH still. He wanted DD to still have stability, and they are good to her, buying her things and spoiling her and taking her places. 

&amp;#x200B;

4 days ago I get a call from my aunt, the woman who raised me, who is still in contact with DD, EH, and everyone. So, some shit did hit the fan. What I didn't know was the EHWM was fucking insane. They are really controlling of DD. It got to the point when EH came home from the road, he would need permission to go get DD every time, and sometimes they denied it. They took her on out of state vacations without permission or knowledge. One time, DD went on a family vacation with grandparents from EH's side. They took a bunch of the kids to Disneyland. DD was coming back on the plane alone. When she got off at the airport, she was to wait with security, and EH or someone else that was on a list to pick her up was to be there. EH was a few minutes late. When he got there, EHWM was losing her SHIT on airport security because they would not give her DD as she was not on the list. EH started to look into other childcare options, but had 1 more trip on the road. When he came back, EHWM refused to give DD back. At all. Said she was living with them now. EH lost his shit and they were arguing, telling him he would never see DD again. EH punched EHWD. (Yes, mistake, but he was scared for DD). 

&amp;#x200B;

So EH takes DD, and leaves. EH's sister was looking after DD. Typical family drama was happening, and then EH got served with papers. EHW is filing for custody. EHWM found out as she has no relation to DD, she doesn't have a chance for custody. They threatened EHW with cutting her off financially if she didn't file for custody. So she did. EH got a lawyer, and said I didn't need to do anything, that he was handling it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, today happened. They have hired private investigators who are harassing me, and there is a process server that is creeping me out. I am trying to get hold of EH, but he is probably stressed beyond max over everything going on. They are saying ridiculously false lies about me and EH. (Of course, custody battles are rarely clean). I am seriously scared. While they are spearing lies, they have a ton of money and power. And EHW doesn't want DD, she is only doing this cause her parents want her to. And they are seriously sick and insane. I am stressed to the point where I can barely think. Any advice would be great, thank you. 

&amp;#x200B;

"Hi everyone! I will post an update on the birthday party situation in a few days. I read all the comments so thank you for all your advice! 

I’ve only met my fmil about 12 times &amp; her behavior progressively is getting worse. She prides herself on being ‘respectful’, her job requires her to take care of the elderly. She prides herself on all the work she does for them, how she’s so selfless, does way too much for other people &amp; never gets anything in return. she is textbook narc - never does anything wrong, never apologizes, always the victim, abuses alcohol &amp; pain killers. Buuut she also prides herself in being a ‘badass’ loves to talk about kicking dumb bitches asses, lives for karma, been in jail before, has a very idgaf attitude, will cuss out &amp; follow people who don’t know how to drive. Talks badly about literally everyone in her life, no one is off limits. She’s in her 50’s but acts about 10.  Now if you ask me she is everything but respectful. 

She shows up uninvited &amp; unannounced. She lets you know she’s ‘on her way over’ when she’s standing at the front door. (This is one of my biggest pet peeves &amp; I find soooo disrespectful)

When she comes over, doesn’t say hi to me, walks right past me, talks indirectly to me, tries to take DD1 from me. 

She NEVER asks, she tells or demands. She tells us when she is visiting. If we tell her the dates don’t work for us, she throws a fit. As I said in my first post, we’re both full time students (she usually wants to visit during the week when we have classes) because SO works odd hours &amp; always on the weekends. So honestly, no days work for us cuz we have something to do everyday regarding school or work or our children. 

We must accommodate her schedule, this goes with the visiting us. She doesn’t ask if we’re busy or have plans, she gets upset that we have a life &amp; don’t want to drive 6+ hours to visit her in another state with two little ones. 

She is the QUEEN of triangulation!!!! She won’t speak to me, has had my number since we met. Constantly asks for it, says she’s never had it. She makes plans to visit, my SO tells her okay then I’m expected to be okay with it. I’m never included in the plans &amp; I’ve pointed this out to SO sooo many times &amp; yet he still does it. 

Will not take no for an answer. Demands to take DD1 alone. Always asks to babysit when we don’t want or need it. Points out that my mom gets to watch them (we live in her house). If she wants to get DD1 a toy, we say no because we honestly don’t have the room. She says too bad, buys it anyway &amp; tells us to just buy a storage unit. We live in a 4 bedroom house with my parents &amp; currently using 3 bedrooms, the den &amp; garage for all of our stuff. 

Doesn’t care to learn about child safety anything. She tried smoking with me in the car while very pregnant. Doesn’t know how to use a car seat but wants to drive my children around. It’s actually illegal to smoke in the car with any minors in our state. Tries to give DD1 soda and candy, doesn’t see what’s wrong with it. Thinks swim lessons at her age are stupid (we have a pool so can never be too safe) doesn’t get why I can’t breastfeed my child as we drive, like as in take her out of her car seat! 

This is getting very long so I will end it here, but please reassure me that these actions are not normal and she clearly has problems with her son having his own life and that she is losing control over him.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi, all! Yes, it is I - the 49F with the 72 year old Mum who fondly imagines she's my carer. You all know the drill by now, I expect! I wasn't expecting to post for while, as I feel like I'm on a reasonably even keel, but something happened this afternoon &amp; I'm not sure if I should feel mildly freaked out or not! Just a brief ""normal meter"" check, really!

Mother phoned, as usual. She was reasonably chipper. Anyway, I mentioned the fact that I'd bought a couple of check shirts this week - one pink, one blue. Mum said, ""What size did you get?"" I told her - she didn't sound terribly impressed (she thinks I'm a bit chubby these days!) but I don't really care about that. She then said, ""You can wear one when you come over tomorrow - I'd like to see it!"" I replied, ""It's very lightweight, I'm not sure it will be warm enough tomorrow!"" Mum said, ""You can wear a cardigan, but wear one over - I'd like to see it!""

She also said, ""Wear one of your nice cardigans - I know you've got some nice ones. You wore one the other week! Don't wear that awful pink thing you often do!"" (By ""pink thing"" she means my cat sweatshirt!)

I can't imagine talking to one of my friends like that; and I can't imagine Mum talking to my brother like that! Is she just taking a rather clumsy interest in my clothes, or is it slightly creepy?! It doesn't seem like much, I know, but a lot of stuff Mum says rings alarm bells these days, where I might not have noticed anything before, but I guess it's possible I'm worrying about nothing at least some of the time!

In other news - Mum has asked to ""borrow"" my cleaner for a few weeks while she recuperates from her hip op, just to clean the bathroom and toilet, that sort of thing. I asked her why step-dad couldn't do that, to which she replied, ""I can't imagine SD getting down to clean a loo or a floor! It's not his job! He'll have enough to do looking after me!"" So step-dad is ""too good"" to do housework, it seems! I'm not sure about this but I will ask my cleaner if she's willing to do a few cleaning sessions for Mum.

Thanks for reading my spiel yet again - I do appreciate everyone's kindness as I battle my way out of the fog!

Edit: Oh good grief, I've just had the most pointless email from Mum, telling me that she &amp; step-dad went to a neighbour's for drinks this evening (which I already knew) - apparently she'd had a very nice evening but has come home because she needed to ""sit and relax"" a bit (whatever that means), and that SD had cold feet. She ends it by saying ""see you tomorrow""! I have no idea why she emailed, if only to remind me that she's frail and not well (she had to leave to recover!) Hmm...",JUSTNOMIL
"First time posting on here, have been with my BF for 2 years. Both mid 20's and we live together. We used to stay over at in laws house for 2 nights every second weekend because FIL was sick (he is lovely and unfortunately the man is married to this hideous woman). We slept on couches every time we went down. Their house is filthy, she never cleans, and either does anyone else who lives there (2 other adult children). When my BF visits he will clean their house.

Relationship with him is great usually, apart from his mother treating me like crap. He has had huge blow up arguments with her about how she treats me - he feels he can't totally cut off visits due to his dad's illness. The times they have fought about it I have had to prompt him to confront her. His mother is a master narcissist/manipulator and she has had 25 years to emotionally abuse and manipulate him. I've only ever been nice to her. She is so sneaky in the way she tries to hurt me sometimes, and other times she is so blatantly obvious. Some examples of what she's done to me/us over the years:

* When we go to visit she will not speak to me unless absolutely necessary. We've been known to go entire weekends with 2/3 words exchanged.
* If I speak to her I get a one word answer or grunt
* If I speak to BF she will cut across me to stop me from speaking
* If BF and I go out to do anything together she will say she ""doesn't want to hear about it"" or ""well for some""
* Has told my BF she is forbidding us from hugging/kissing ever in front of her or their family
* The last time we stayed (again we have to sleep on couches - I have cut these overnight visits off since!!) she couldn't wait to tell us there was an ant infestation in their sitting room. Told us if we didn't want to sleep with ants to go sleep in the (filthy, not converted, not insulated, no beds) attic.
* Told my partner she finds me difficult to speak to (I'm not!! I'm a nurse - I've literally been trained in communication) and has compared me to his ex girlfriend who she hated
* Some of my partner's post went to her house (it no longer does). She opened it - he confronted her and her excuse was ""Well I didn't know what it was"". Obviously, it's not your post you controlling cow!
* If my partner has to fill out any forms/documents she will stand over him and tell him how to do it. HE'S 25!
* Phones him every single night (sometimes at midnight even though she knows I get up at 5 to work) to speak about absolutely nothing. I have confronted him about this and he has agreed nightly calls are too much and too intrusive.
* Has asked him if he has her on loud speaker when she calls (he doesn't). He said no and she said ""well make sure you don't, sometimes I hear \*my name\* speaking when I'm on the phone"". Basically telling me I'm not to dare speak if she is on the phone to him!
* Brought her a pricey tin of M&amp;S biscuits (it was pricey for me, at the time I was 21 and an unpaid student nurse) to which she responded ""So you didn't even get the nice ones?""
* For my birthday gave me an old vase covered in dust which my BF tells me is old from their attic (she's something of a hoarder).
* Never ever asks anything about my life or family, we may as well be nonexistent.
* Treats my BF's sister's relationship very differently. They are younger than us and less serious, however my MIL cannot stop commenting how much she loves her new 'SIL'. My BF and I don't drive, either does his sister or her partner. Every time the sister and partner come to visit, they get a lift from BF's parents to train station when it's time to go home. BF and I have never gotten a lift, we have to get a bus and a connecting train. BF kindly asked his mum last weekend would she mind, she refused.
* My BF got a new job and instantly she tried to get him to move home as she told him it would be easier to travel to the new job from her home. It wouldn't, but even if it would be - get a grip!

The thing that drives me mad more than anything is the control she tries to exert. Please tell me I'm not alone and not a 'crazy girlfriend' for thinking she's a bitch.",JUSTNOMIL
"Long time lurker, throwaway, you know the drill. I dropped the rope and went VVVLC with my in-laws about 9 months ago after 7 years of my MIL's deaths by a thousand paper cuts. I got a couple of stories which I'll post later if anyone is interested. The final straw was how she rejected my one-year-old DD  (yes she's their son's), and I have not looked back since.

Although my D(earest and darling)H is behind me and also went VVLC when I did, he has since gone back to LC. This is where my dilemma comes in and where I need advice.

Not that I expect them or even would like them to, but my in-laws do nothing for us. They don't help us financially or otherwise. Although they live in the condo below us (yes I know, BIG mistake but hindsight is 20/20) they barely even see their grandchildren. My own family lives out of state so childcare is an immense burden that we did not anticipate because according to my MIL, ""she was going to fulfill her responsibility as a grandma and help with the kids."" Some background - there's a big, big cultural aspect to that whole ""childcare is a grandparent's responsibility"" role, and she did watch our four-year-old DS from birth to age 2 so I anticipated her helping us with DD until she changed her tune.

But I digress. They don't help at all and we don't socialize with them. BUT...MIL and FIL ARE ALWAYS ASKING MY HUSBAND FOR FAVORS!! They recently bought a house in southern tropical retirement state and they asked him to lend them the balance transfers on several credit cards (around $25K). They are paying it back but WTF. Since I don't work, I don't feel right telling him that he can't help his parents, and there is very little chance they will default but it's still a large favor.

They also don't speak English very well so they are always asking him to translate letters, make phone calls, write emails, place Amazon orders, etc. Every week it's something. I say week and not day only because they spend days at a time in southern tropical state and then come back north for a couple of days as they are preparing their new house.

Furthermore, My FIL is a truck driver, and when he's over the road and my MIL is home she is constantly asking my husband to drive her around for errands as she doesn't drive and doesn't plan to learn. THIS ONE is the one that really bothers me, because my husband works his ass off 5 days and has very little time for himself because I need him to watch the kids on his days off as that's the only time I have to study (I'm a full-time student). Plus, it just plain bothers me that he does so much for these people who have basically turned their back on us.

Should I put my foot down and say, no more favors for your mom? Part of me is afraid to because there are odd occasions (appx 4X a year) when she actually helps to watch my son and this resource would be gone. Plus, it would fall back on him as they would harass him endlessly about being a bad son and disrespectful, and what type of bitch did he marry that would prevent him from helping his helpless parents? He would never hear the end of it, and because they are literally our downstairs neighbors we can't go NC/CO.

We do plan to move out of state in less than two years. Is it worth keeping the peace until then or should I put my foot down on the favors? My husband is a people pleaser which honestly works in my favor most of the time but not when his parents are concerned. Advice would help. I know there's a lot of both in-laws in my post but MIL is the main source of conflict and the reason I dropped the rope.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR MIL is NC with me and VLC with DH and kids, but is always asking for favors that cut into DH's resting and family time. They live downstairs so NC is not possible until we move. Should I put my foot down and prevent him from helping his awful parents or let them keep taking advantage of him?",JUSTNOMIL
" 

TT has been only seeing us on holidays, when before she would come every other week or sometimes twice a week. I have always been nice and civil to her face. Then all of a sudden, she started making plans and ghosting us, of course I'm not going to nag her to visit so I just gently remind D(ear)H his mother has let us down once again. She came to see the girls last week -  a solid 6 WEEKS after she last saw them at Easter. Everytime she comes she brings some random garbage- more toys she got at a garage sale, but her favorite is to get us clothes that they have already outgrown 🙄 

&amp;#x200B;

Her excuse to come was it was my birthday and she wanted to give me a gift card. She only stayed for HALF AN HOUR and then left! She is impossible to plan with, whenever she texts/calls she wants to come within 15 mins. Once time I texted her 24 min after and she said ""It's too late now"" WTF?? That day she texted asking to come at noon, I said the girls wake up at 1, would you like to come then? She said she had a friend she was meeting with at 130, but would see if she could move it. I said that's fine, They are awake until 4 so you have a window to be here.

&amp;#x200B;

Guys. This bitch showed up at 2. Okay, I figure she must have already seen her friend. Then 230 comes and she has to go, because THE FRIEND SHE WAS PLANNING ON SEEING HAS AN APPT AT 3. So she planned some bullshit reason so she only had to stay for 30 min?? Why even come?? 

&amp;#x200B;

She only lives 10-15min away depending on traffic. The next day, my husband went to visit his grandma and his parents were there for over 2 HOURS. His grandma only lives 3 blocks from us!

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday we wanted to go to order the babies' birthday cakes together, and he insisted on calling his mother to watch them (despite us having a completely reliable babysitter available). She insisted she come while the girls were still napping. Well, ok, whatever. She gets here and we give her specific instructions on how to feed them when they wake up, prefill bottles, etc. I was really specific that although they hold their bottles by themselves, if they flip over before they're done, they should be flipped back and given their bottle so they finish eating. They usually eat 4-5oz at least. 

&amp;#x200B;

We come home to a house with ALL OF THE DOORS CLOSED because she said ""I just can't be chasing babies down the hall all the time"". Um, what?? They still frog hop over the floor. They are not fast by any means. Then I go to check the bottles, and there is so much milk left, the babies ate less than 2 oz!! I feel like she just sat on the couch and ignored them the whole time she was here.

&amp;#x200B;

My poor DH wants his mother involved in the girls' lives. My parents take them every Sunday, for the full  day, and love it. He wants his mother to do something similar but she isn't interested and honestly I don't think she is capable. I don't trust her. He said it would be nice if she did it ""at least once a month"", but this twat can't even VISIT more than a half hour once a month! I just want to throw all her garbage gifts in her face and tell her we don't want things, we just want time, but my husband always wants to accept her stupid gifts because ""it makes her feel good"". Please note I am not complaining about DH- he is a very sweet man that just wants his mother to have a relationship with her grandkids and is doing his best.

&amp;#x200B;

I would understand if the girls are absolute dragons, but they're good girls! They're always smiling, playing, they love people. They always scoot over with things in their hands to show you or just crawl into your lap. They don't need to be held constantly and are pretty independent, and only cry if they're hungry.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the good? news is it isn't just us. BIL has made multiple comments that she doesn't come to visit them at all either. His children are 6 and 8. He called and told us she will go 2+ months without seeing his kids because she can't be bothered to.",JUSTNOMIL
"My JNM and I are no contact, despite her best efforts. See Bitchbot for details on why.


As I have previously stated, she is blocked on every platform. My social media profiles are super locked down. The last time she texted me was mother's day. She has texted my JNSTBXH trying to establish a relationship with him. He ignored it and let me know, then told me how he would handle it if she showed up to his parents house. 

She has texted a few of my friends parents, asking if they still had the same number. My friends parents are mostly aware of her shenanigans, and afaik have ignored her. 

I have been told that I'm paranoid, that she just wants to have a relationship. It blows my mind how I'm painted as the bad guy for trying to protect my children after everything she's done. My gut is telling me that something big is headed my way involving her. I'm scared. Idk what to do to best protect my family from this monster in human clothes.",JUSTNOMIL
"So I have posted here before about my justnomil. My DH and I went NC for a year and a half. She and my FIL wanted my DH to divorce me and move home. After my DH refused he cut contact until my MIL corrected her behavior. About a year ago she called me and apologized. I explained I would accept her apology but the trust has been broken. I told her I would need to move slow and start from the ground up. Since then she has tried really hard to keep her nonsense to a minimum. She hasn’t stepped over boundaries and actually appears to be trying. This is the first effort I have seen on her behalf since my husband and I married 7 years ago. I think the prospect of losing her only son has really shaken her and made her see my DH will not play games. He married me for a reason and has proven to her and me that he will choose us over her EVERYTIME. 

Since MIL is honestly trying really hard, I would like to invite her to lunch as a thank you and a get to know each other kind of thing. My DH is 100% supportive of this idea. He thinks I should. My purpose is to try to and develop even a small friendship with her since she is making an effort. Just like bad behavior should be punished, I think good behavior should be rewarded. What advice do y’all have? What would be the best way to invite her out? Just a note, my DH won’t be there so I plan on having lunch in public. I welcome any and all advice.",JUSTNOMIL
"I've decided to call my mother Breeder, because that's about all she's good for as a ""parent."" She has 5 kids, me being the oldest, with 4 different men. No shame in that except only 2 of them are still in the picture. One of them is frequently in and out of jail for meth. The other lives 3 states away and divorced her because she got pregnant. Let's not even get into the other multiple (failed) marriages she's had.

&amp;#x200B;

tw for: miscarriage, abuse, damn near everything that could be triggering. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know where to start. To detail my childhood would require me to dig up many repressed memories, but I just need to rant about how god awful my mother is to people who get it. This is going to be a long post because I have so much to get off my chest that I've been keeping from everybody.

&amp;#x200B;

As a child, I took care of my siblings. I remember being as young as 8 years old taking care of my sister and brothers. I would make sure they bathed, brushed their teeth, and had clean clothes for school. I learned to forge my mom's signature for field trip forms and report cards. My mom locked herself away in her room, tin foil over the windows, all lights out. I remember dreading going home because I was unsure if we would have running water or electricity. I had to remind her to go grocery shopping because we ran out of food (that I always made for us, as a child). If it weren't for food stamps, we would have starved.

&amp;#x200B;

I transferred schools *3 different times* my freshman year because of her. We always had to move around so much because she can never make on time payments for anything. I almost failed the 9th grade because I was so depressed. It's sad that I can't remember names of teachers I've had or friends I had because I didn't get to stay long enough to get to know them.

&amp;#x200B;

She married a man we moved 3 states away for. She wasn't supposed to be able to have any more children because of medical reasons and she fell pregnant. Her husband separated from her because he didn't want any more children. We packed up all of our things in the middle of the night on a school night to come back to our home state. She eventually had a miscarriage, which is very sad, but after she told her husband she took him back. My mom moved back there and I stayed home with my father. My mother and my youngest (at the time) brother lived in their own apartment. They had no money for anything. My mother was constantly passing out because she couldn't afford food. The man she was ""in love with"" and married to refused to help her. All he did was show up to have sex with her and leave. She fell pregnant again, and this time he divorced her. She moved back.

&amp;#x200B;

I spent my 18th birthday packing up our rental house because my mother broke the lease by painting the walls when she knew she wasn't supposed to. We lived in hotels from the 3rd day of October until a week before Christmas. None of my friends knew. I was so embarrassed and ashamed. We moved into an apartment that she later stopped paying for. She owes that complex thousands of dollars they will probably never see.

&amp;#x200B;

We were homeless several times and there were 6 of us staying at my grandfather's. He only has one spare room. My sister and I took the office and slept on the floor for months. You know what my mom did? Played video games all day every day instead of looking for a job to support herself and her kids. It's what she still does. My mother spends more time on Fornite than taking care of my brothers.

&amp;#x200B;

She married a man a few years ago she was off and on with. They got married in September. By December they had already filed for divorce. She married a verbally, mentally, and physically abusive man. I forced her to call the police or I would because it was unsafe for my brothers. He was arrested and then what does she do? She bails him out herself. I couldn't believe it. Now she's dating a married man. Their first date he gave her a different name and told her he was widowed. That was the first lie. He lies about everything. Can't even keep his lies straight. She has caught him cheating on multiple occasions but she won't leave. Instead she uses his money to go on vacations because she ""needs a break."" A break from what, exactly?! YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING WITH YOUR LIFE.

&amp;#x200B;

She moved 6+ hours away with this man with 2 of my brothers without telling me, my sister, or my brother. I stopped by her house the morning she was leaving just to say hi and that's how I found out. She moved in August 2018 and was back by December. This is not normal. It just can't be.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom has never held down a job for more than 6 months. She hasn't been employed for over 2 years. As of now she has a 16 and a 6 year old. She is living with 2 kids in one bedroom at my grandfather's house *again* because she can't afford the house she was renting, even though she always referred to her rent as a ""mortgage payment."" The owner of the house just filed a lawsuit against her. You know what she lives off of? The $800 a month she receives in child support and my retired grandfather's pension. She's damn near 40 and doesn't pay her own phone bill, car payment, car insurance, etc because my grandfather pays it. My mom is never going to grow up and I'm so sick of it. My brothers deserve better but I'm only 22, pregnant with my own child, and I'm not sure if I could take custody of them because I'm worried about how I would be able to afford 3 kids. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of my brothers, my only full sibling, recently turned 18. He has been living with my dad since he was very young. The only reason I didn't go full time with my dad is because I was worried for my siblings. The 18 year old is very very LC with our mom, and I don't blame him. I honestly don't know what to do in this situation and if I take legal action, will my brothers hate me? Will they resent me? I'll likely never see or speak to my mother again. She's also very mentally unstable and I'm worried she would do something to hurt herself. I'm also very scared of my mom after a lifetime of verbal, mental, and sometimes physical abuse. If you've read this long, thank you for listening. If you can offer any advice, I would appreciate it, but please be gentle.  I'm pregnant and emotional and yes, I'm in therapy.",JUSTNOMIL
"So my MIL and FIL has been staying with us for a week. First time I have ever had to stay with her. Never particularly like her but I stay civil for the sake of DH.

However in the past week she has made my blood boil. That aside, I can put the little things as just lifestyle differences. (She came and rearranged my kitchen, threw out some of my things etc etc)

What is annoying me beyond my belief is, she is whispering/bitching about me to my DH right this moment in less than 5m away. We live in a small 2 bedroom apartment, so it's not like there is heaps of space. 

DH and I have a great relationship and even he thinks that his parents are overbearing. 

Part of me wants to confront her but I would put DH in the middle.

I cannot wait till they leave!!!

UPDATE: thanks for all the support guys. I walked outside and offered her tea. Told her she did a lot of talking and must be thirsty by now. She got all embarrassed and mumbled she didn't meant for me to hear it. I told her if she wants private conversations, my home is not the right place.

That was as passive aggressive as I could be with a smile on my face.",JUSTNOMIL
"First time poster, I just need to type this all out &amp; maybe get some advice. Sorry, it’s long &amp; I’m on mobile so formatting might be off. 

Background: I’ve been with DH for 6 years, we have DS who’s 4 years old &amp; DD who’s 5 months. My relationship with the in-laws was good until DS was born. I tried really hard to exclusively breastfeed, but ultimately didn’t produce enough. DS was close to “failure to thrive” until I switched to formula when he was 4 months. In that time, the in-laws were really unsupportive of my decision to breastfeed. Highlights include MIL sneaking one of my 2-year-old niece’s pacifiers in my 3-week-old DS’s mouth because “they had never seen a baby without a paci in its mouth before.” We weren’t giving him one because 1. Nipple confusion &amp; 2. Acting as a human pacifier stimulates milk supply. Another highlight was FIL yelling at me, “I want to give my grandson a bottle! I WANT TO FEED HIM! You are STARVING him!” That’s right folks, he accused an already stressed-out, postpartum, hormonal new mother of starving her infant for trying to make breastfeeding work.  I went LC with them after these incidents, and have held them at arm’s length ever since. I have tried to move past it (although I’ve never received an apology for the way they acted, or acknowledgement that they were wrong to treat me that way. They’re the king &amp; queen of rug sweeping). 

On to the current issue. We were at a family BBQ on Memorial Day when all the kids got popsicles. MIL asked if she could give one to 4-month-old DD &amp; I said no. We had only barely started her on solid foods, and DH &amp; I don’t believe in giving babies sugar this young. I looked at DS for a moment, and when I looked back I saw MIL rub her finger all over BIL’s fudgesicle &amp; stick it in DD’s mouth!! Side note, she had just put sunscreen on my nephew &amp; hadn’t washed her hands. She looked at SIL like “tee hee I’m so bad look what I did.” I said “MIL, don’t do that!” Then immediately asked DH to get DD &amp; bring her to me. I didn’t speak to MIL the rest of the day, and did not let DD out of my arms. When I went inside (with DD) to get changed, MIL asked DH if I was angry with her and DH told her yes. He said it’s not ok for her to undermine me like that, and especially not ok to give a baby this young chocolate! MIL said “I wasn’t trying to give her chocolate, but she wanted a treat too!” Uh no MIL, the infant had no idea what the older cousins were doing. Then she started in about “I raised you and your siblings and you all turned out just fine blah blah blah” but DH shut her down. It’s taken a few years of pulling him out of the FOG but he now has a shiny spine when it comes to the bullshit his parents pull. 

We haven’t spoken to MIL since then. DH spoke to FIL a few days ago &amp; the topic came up about how we were angry with MIL for that stunt, and for refusing to acknowledge her mistake or apologize for it. FIL seemed supportive of us, he said MIL was wrong for what she did &amp; she just can’t help but stir up trouble (which is true). DH told FIL that MIL sealed the deal that she won’t be babysitting DD for a long time, til DD can talk at least, because if MIL can’t respect our wishes when we are there then what would she do when we aren’t? 

Well. I guess FIL dealt with a tornado of shit at home because he called DH yesterday &amp; had done a 180. Obviously FIL told MIL what we said about being upset with her &amp; not wanting her to babysit. FIL went in on DH about how upset MIL is, because “you know MIL is fit to watch any kid” and “you can’t be petty &amp; hold this over her head forever.” It’s been less than 2 weeks, and we still haven’t received acknowledgment of wrongdoing &amp; an apology for it, which is all we want. MIL thrives on drama though, so of course instead of dealing with this like an adult she’s sending FM FIL to do her bidding. DH told FIL that all we want from MIL is acknowledgement &amp; an apology, and apparently FIL responded by bringing up how I was “wrong” about breastfeeding DS &amp; I STARVED him (FIL’s words, again) and they (MIL &amp; FIL) were right about him needing formula. So apparently making a mistake FOUR years ago about DS’s eating habits means we are wrong about not wanting DD to have a damn fudgesicle at 4 months? And who’s the one being petty &amp; holding stuff over our heads now? After he started in on that DH just hung up the phone. 

I am so irritated. I am grateful DH is fully supportive &amp; not wanting to rugsweep this, but I’m just so angry that MIL acts like this. Why can’t she just respect DH &amp; I as parents? Why does she have to thrive on drama like this? If you made it all the way through this, thanks for reading. I’m not sure what kind of advice I’m looking for, but I’m open to whatever you all have to say.",JUSTNOMIL
"I posted a few days ago, about all the drama taking place at home while I am on a work trip for a week. I thought people would like to hear about the ILs crazy over the next couple days. 

DH left home on Thursday, for a weekend with friends and watching the Montreal Grand Prix. ILs have been home alone with DS for three days, and I’ll be home tomorrow. 

The day DH left, ILs have concluded that DS has a horrible cold, apparently its keeping him up at night. So he is staying home from daycare now. Of course, without daycare to distract him and with the change in routine, he misses me and DH much more! Smart move, ILs! 

IMO when I see him on our daily video calls, he doesn’t seem sick to me. But I will defer that fight till I actually see him. 

Yesterday, DS was fast asleep at 6:30 pm. Anytime I look at our house cameras, one or other of the ILs is carrying him around on the hip - he’s 2 years old for gawd’s sakes! And heavy! ... I have no idea what I’m walking into when I get back.",JUSTNOMIL
"So I posted about a week ago about my MIL booking a ticket for a surprise month-long visit to my home. I shared that I had to rush to get a lot ready. In comments, I let people know I managed to get it all done and everything was going to plan. 

And THEN.... 

Today is the second day my MIL has been here. Two nights ago I picked her up at the train station at 2am running on NO SLEEP because DH had to work in the morning. Yesterday was day one and went well. 

I woke up early and bought MIL a coffee omw home from dropping DH at work. Offered her bfast, but she declined. So we got dressed for the day and headed out to do some shopping she needed to do. Finished that up and took her with me to take my brothers girlfriend and their baby for his 2 month check up. Came home and cooked dinner. MIL headed to bed around 11pm. DH and I stayed up and worked on our business plan for another hour before we went to bed ourselves. 

Today is day 2. 

I woke up a little bit late today because I'm sick. First thing MIL says to me is she's so sorry she made me mad. I didn't know what she was talking about and told her she hadn't made me mad at all. She said she heard me talking badly about her last night, which I assured her wasn't the case. Explained I was up working on my business plan. All day, every ten minutes (and that's literally not an exaggeration) she kept telling me to just tell her what she did wrong and she didn't wanna make me mad. Told her over and over and OVER she hadn't done anything wrong and no one was talking about her. She locked herself in her room any time that she wasn't talking about knowing she had upset me. My kids came home from school and were doing their chores. My daughter who has ODD came out and I told her she needed to finish her chores. She gave me a bad attitude and slammed her door, but started cleaning. Because my kid has ODD its actually pointless to react to little things like that, because she feeds off of negative responses as much as positive ones. So I ignored her since she was going to finish her chores. MIL starts telling me how I need to reprimand her and there's no way her kids ever would have been allowed to get away with that blah blah blah. I said, ""your kids didn't have ODD. I know how best to discipline my child and where and when its necessary."" She went back to her room. DH comes home and she immediately starts in about how sorry she is that she upset me last night and that she heard me talking badly about her to him. He told her none of that was the case and that she's just fine. Then she says she heard him being mad this morning and knew it was because of her. He wasnt mad this morning, he was getting kids up for school and he told her that. Still, every ten minutes she keeps it up. 

By this point I'm frustrated because I've been nothing but nice and inviting, to no avail. I go outside to smoke and my husband asks me what's wrong. I tell him I've just had a bad day between the kids and dogs and that idk what else I can do to make his mother feel comfortable but that I'm trying. 

HE TELLS ME ITS MY FAULT.  That I'm not being very approachable and I'm clearly in a bad mood. I told him, yes I am. But that I've been nothing but nice and my frustration didn't even begin until hours in of dealing with this. He insisted it's my fault. So now I've locked myself in my room in my own house because apparently my presence in my own home is unwelcomed. I'm FUMING. This woman won't stop. I've even heard her going on about it again from my room. Idk how many times I can repeat myself that I wasnt talking about her or mad at her last night before my head explodes. And now I actually AM mad at the whole situation. 😬😬😬",JUSTNOMIL
"Home for around 36 hours to visit family, and decided to reach out to PsychoMom to fill her in on how life is. I thought it would be good to at least meet with her in a constructive way. I initially asked for coffee at a local bakery in the morning, she asked to come to my father's house to speak \*to\* me privately. I suggested a drink at a local bar if she was only available in the evening, she countered with a walk at a local park. We eventually settled on the bar. Picked the most crowded one in town.

&amp;#x200B;

She brought her boyfriend, who was not invited, but hey, I'm in a good place and I can roll with the punches. We sat down for drinks (and a snack, we had been traveling all day and were quite hungry). Que passive aggressive remarks about how they wished they hadn't eaten dinner because they didn't know we were eating, passive aggressive remarks about how much they don't know, blah blah blah. Around an hour ensues of us telling funny stories about SKs, traveling, work, you know, the usual. They keep trying to cut in but I figure that if I keep talking about the mundane, the message will get through.

&amp;#x200B;

NOPE. ""I need closure, I don't understand why you've cut off all contact with me, I don't understand what I did."" I responded in kind-""I feel like I've been pretty clear. We just thought it would be nice to meet with you tonight to update you on how our lives are going. I'm not interested in discussing this.""

&amp;#x200B;

She pressed on, I demurred to have the conversation. DH steps in, tries to steer things back on track. She presses on again. DH tries to put a positive spin on things. She is nearly in tears now, getting more aggressive and the boyfriend is on the attack.  At this point I had already settled our bill because I saw this coming and reader, I walked away.

&amp;#x200B;

""I was having a really pleasant evening, what a pity it had to end like this"".

Walk away. Before you spend your energy and effort chasing their tail for them, leave. Bounce. Put it down and leave it all behind.

Trust me, staying calm will set you free.

"I wish this was just the Sound of Music (where I could leave during intermission because, while I super respect Julie ANDREWS - ty person for the correction, i always got julie andrews/julia Roberts mixed up - and all the actors/actresses, just never my cup of tea) but its not. Theres no intermission to leave through, there's no avoiding it when you've fallen for their preeeeeccciiiiioooooouuussss. While theres NC its hard to keep that 110% (or it is for me, at least). I've been wanting to post this for awhile, but whenever I come here its to see other JNMILs being their JN selves or as Im about to type something shitty happens and I cant find the energy to post anymore. Im ready and Im also ready to see if anyone has any name suggestions for her, please toss em!!

Anyway, on to the Fateful Meeting. Pre-meeting, my SO and I had been best friends for a few years. I mention this because he also spoke to me as a confidant in that time and told me when his mother REALLY bothered him so I already had an inkling that this woman wasn't always...nice. But, benefit of the doubt: these instances happened very, very far apart and parents aren't always there to make you happy. Scolding isnt a happy thing, kids cry, it happens. My parents have certainly made me cry, so, again, benefit of the doubt. Then he and I start dating and I met his Dad and Step Mom (bless them, I love them to the moon and back) very quickly--within the first 2-3 weeks we were dating, quick. Natural progression after a few months of dating and hes met my parents: ""When will I meet your mom?"" And hes hesitant but I persist. Im a technically a guest, she'll be nice for at LEAST our first meeting. I'll need to meet her eventually. etc.etc

If only I had listened. He warned me. He prepared me best he could. He did everything in his power to ensure I knew what I was walking into, and yet I was still just a meager little lamb walking into the lion's den. I thought I had thick skin, I could take whatever she throws my way. I've been bullied, I've been ostracized and made the center of attention. I could handle her.

I walk into her house and SO introduces us. ""Mom, this is OP, OP this is my mom, JN."" Im a hand shaker when I meet people. Its how I made some awesome friends in college by just hucking my hand out there and saying, ""Hey, Im OP."" For such casual settings it generates a chuckle, which is an awesome side affect since shaking hands is second nature to me (run my own business, I shake many a-hands upon meeting people). I couldn't bring myself to put my hand out for her. Granted, I was a much less experienced 'hand shaker' at the time (being in gr 12, so about 17) but it was still something I did when I met new people. I just....couldn't. She had this look on her face like she wanted to eat me, trying to hide it beneath a smile. 

I told myself: give her a chance. 

I barely had the thought formulated and my ass seated in her kitchen when she started making remarks on my appearance. My complexion (Im white, shes Filipino) was a hot topic for her. It's where she came up with my nickname and inspiration for all subsequent ones: ""Pale Girl"" (today her top 2 are White Girl and Casper). She'd ask me normal questions about what I wanted to do for a career, where I wanted to go to school etc. Questions that are usually *normal* except she had this look in her eyes and this tilt to her chin like every answer I gave made me look dirty to her. She has a very pristine house, she is a very Type A, white-glove to her clothes person and me telling her my initial choice for a job at 17 was essentially a Forest Ranger (she WISHES i was a forest ranger now)....god I was *scum* to her. Every word she said was passive aggressive and condescending and I couldn't wait to leave.

When my SO finally could drive me home, when we entered the car we just sat there for a moment. He said, ""So, now you see what Ive been dealing with."" I nod and made a joke, ""I think she likes me."" My SO laughed and answered, ""Honestly,  I dont think she even likes *me* half the time Im there."" He drove me home and we got some consolation slushies for going through all that.

&amp;#x200B;

Through all that you be wondering: where was your SO OP??? He was right beside me, listening to every word. No, he didnt say anything. He didnt have the glorious spine he has now. Him not speaking up for me only happened a handful more times before I had a talk with him about it (he didnt want to make things worse by saying anything. His mother has a hairpin trigger on her anger) and now he's amazing and doesn't put up with her BS.",JUSTNOMIL
"So, I’m generally pretty good at gray rocking, but MIL is relentless and strategic in her quest for info. She asks seemingly unavoidable questions, so I need y’alls help in responding to questions like this:

“So, OP, do you have any trips to [your home state] planned?”

I don’t want to lie, but I also don’t want her to know because it’s her way of keeping score of visits. 

I also know I could just be like “that’s none of your business,” but I have a pretty polite rapport with them and I’d like to keep it that way.",JUSTNOMIL
"This is my first time posting. Long time lurker. 

My mom is a JN. She has her moments where we get along fine but those don’t seem to last long. On to the story. 

She took my DS to ice cream &amp; brought him back home to me. He asked her to stay &amp; play &amp; she said she couldn’t, she needed to go home &amp; watch a video about suicide. She’s a therapist &amp; needed to watch this video to get a certificate on it. I told her do not talk to my son like that, she could have just told him she needed to go home &amp; watch a work video. She laughs it off &amp; says he doesn’t know what it means. I tell her that it doesn’t matter, he doesn’t need to be talked to like that or be asking me what suicide means. She sticks around a few minutes &amp; goes okay I really need to go. DS asks her to stay &amp; she says no I need to go home &amp; watch a work video... about suicide. &amp; starts laughing! I lost my shit &amp; told her to go home, she didn’t need to be around us at all. Get the fuck out. She is laughing as she goes to her car, blows me kisses, I flip her off &amp; go inside. 

I was telling my dad this story (they’ve been divorced like 15 years) &amp; he says she thinks she just gets bored &amp; likes to push my buttons. 

I’ve already decided I am no contact for the foreseeable future. If she cannot listen to basic instructions &amp; just have common sense on what is fucking okay to talk to a 4 year old about I do not want her around or to talk to her. I’m pissed. I also think I have decided she cannot be alone with him. She clearly can’t talk about age appropriate subjects when I’m sitting in front of her, she doesn’t need to be alone with him. 

Now where I need advice, I’ve cut her off. I am not answering her calls or texts. But she KEEPS texting &amp; calling me. She’s texted like 20 times &amp; called like 5? But I haven’t told her I’m not talking to her or why. Even though it should be obvious. Should I answer her just once &amp; let her know how she fucked up? Or just keep on keeping on until I’ve decided I’m ready? I’m just sick of her bothering me &amp; she’s started to call &amp; text my husband asking if I’m ignoring her/if I’m alive 🙄

"I've just recently graduated from private u and got accepted to work in hr dept on a big local company. Previously it has been odd jobs for me while i was dating and before that both F&amp;MIL would pressure me to keep submitting cv applications to government jobs just like how DH siblings all work as teachers getting income and annual raise with attractive staff benefits from ministy of education fundings. I've been getting tired of their constant rant and bringing up the topic whenever possible while my husband is not anywhere seen. Because me and my husband isn't making as much as his youngest sister, it didn't make it feel any better too to hear MIL said she got a raise twice in half a year while we're still stuck at basic wages working from beg of yr till yr end (teachers get to stay at home during school holidays which sometimes is more than private companies)
I just feel shitty every single time like what do they want me to do about it? I applied and there's tons of ppl trying out hoping to be able to land a spot in the government sector. It made me felt like i wasn't good enough to be with his family. It got me depressed thinking ""oh I'll gladly give my seat to a new and much worthy wife who is of better financial standing and just leave if you're that unsatisfied about my career choice, it's not that hard to file for a divorce you would want that huh?""

"So I just got back from talking with xfdh. I asked about the texts from xmil. They were all lies. Xfdh doesn't know how she even got my number again. 

Xfdh said he does still love me but we're not back together. We just have to work on us. Mostly him and his depression. He wants to get back together though just not this minute.

Xfdh also debunked all of xmil's texts. And she's not allowed anywhere near our storage unit. For now though we will be putting some of my stuff in there. Mostly to keep it away from xmil. She likes to break, steal, and give away things that don't belong to her.

Xfdh did get mad though when I told him about the texts from xmil. So good luck to her on getting out of that situation. 

On the pregnancy... I didn't tell xfdh. I almost did but I got scared. But I am pregnant and terrified of losing it. Xfdh brought me all my medicine I had asked for (like prenatal stuff) but he just thinks I'm sick from being sad, he doesn't know that I'm actually having morning sickness. I don't want xmil to find out cause she'll do everything to get the baby away from me since we're not together right now. And I really don't want baby near her without me present.

Of course xmil has to make this about her though nothing can be about xfdh or I. I'm really mad that she's inserted herself into this by texting me. Especially behind his back. Good thing I'm smart enough to not type out our storage codes. I hope he tears her a new one tonight. At least xfdh is still trying to protect me from xmil.",JUSTNOMIL
"This sub feels like home, and I’m grateful for it but I wish I would have never had a reason to join!

A few days ago, DH made a comment regarding his mom like “yeah, probably I was high with my mom” or “if my mom was able to walk” or something troll-ish like that. That will be important later.

Now, this morning I got a notification that FSFIL (??, her fourth husband) is following me on Instagram. I figured it was her with her fat sausage fingers, trying to see if I’m sharing pictures of DD. So I sent a message saying “hey, I just noticed you’re following me, do I know you?”. No response. A couple of hours pass and I decide to send a text saying that I know it’s her, that we don’t want to be involved with them and to stop making contact attempts, just to document because I can see now she’s not going to stop; so I go to his/her profile to send the message and poof, that account no longer exists. 
Mine is an old account that I only use to message a few people, my name is not on it but it’s linked to my Facebook account.


Then, I got a weird Facebook friend request from some dude from New York. I do message him and I say “hey, do I know you? My crazy mother in law is stalking me again and I only want to make sure this is not her”.  The guy hasn’t responded so it could have, could have not been her. I honestly don’t care, I’ve been joking about it with my SIL all day long. 

So then my actual FIL gets a phone call from her, saying that she’s going to call the cops on DH because he talked about her on Facebook (he blocked her so she probably has another account or uses her boyfriend’s account to stalk).And I still don’t know why, I am brought up in the conversation and she said that I started following her future husband on IG. Like, how did she know that’s my account if it doesn’t have my name or my pictures? Bitch doesn’t even know how to lie. She hung up on my FIL because he was laughing his ass off at her.

She’s crazy, she might call the cops for real over some stupid crap like that, but, what’s next? Keep ignoring? Keep documenting whatever? (I did screenshot everything, lol). Why can’t she leave us the fuck alone?

Any advice is appreciated because, honestly, I’m lost.",JUSTNOMIL
"I'm sorry for any formatting, I'm on mobile. This is only the 2nd time I've ever posted about her.

 So yeah, my Mom &amp; I were texting today, it's the only way we talk, thank god. Unfortunately we've had to talk more this week because my XMIL is in ICU and not expected to make it. I also recently found out that I'm pregnant (16wks!) &amp; Very high risk so Mom has been acting like she cares about me now. She's honestly just interested enough to get info to use in her ""Woe is me"" sob stories she tells her Internet friends. Anyway, sorry for going off topic a little there, so we're texting and she asks me how XMIL is doing &amp; I reply she's the same. This b!t¢h then asks me if things are going well with my pregnancy still &amp; had I seen my specialist yet. Her very next sentence is, direct quote here: ""Do you think you could get me some Boi? I'll get you some too, if you will. IDC who don't like it, I just need to get that don't care nod lol""...ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS MOM?!?

 Full disclosure is, I'm a recovering heroin addict, I'm 2yrs 8m sober. And again, also pregnant. She knows all of this and still had the audacity to ask! I have told her, repeatedly, I wanted nothing to do with heroin. To please not talk to me about doing drugs, to not ask me to get them. Also who TF asks their kid to get high with them period? 

I wish I could cut off all contact with her, but I still have a couple brothers that live with her. I have 10 siblings and it's taking some time to get the younger ones out &amp; living with us older sibs. 3 of my brothers have Asperger's as well so it's made things interesting at times.

Thank you for letting me rant and rave to you all, I've needed to talk to someone about things for awhile now. This happened about an hour ago &amp; I just snapped. You think I'd be use to her behavior by now, it's still painful. Do you ever get over wishing you had a good mom?

"Days before I gave birth to my second daughter I texted my MIL telling her that our newest bundle of joy would arrive soon and we would like to keep visitors at the hospital limited to mine and my DH’s parents and siblings. This meant that her mom and sister would have to wait until we got home to visit the baby. My MIL makes everything about her mom. Literally, there has not been one visit when she hasn’t done this. My text also told her that we didn’t want anyone in the delivery room because we wanted the birth to be intimate with just us. I also told her this during my first delivery but I ended up having my mom in the room and I think she felt entitled so she came in and constantly commented about my contractions, recorded me on her phone and constantly kept moving my gown down. Mind you my FIL is standing right next to her. Back to the text, she never responded and I told my husband that I think she was upset because we only wanted immediate family at the hospital and asked not to come into the delivery room. We requested this for several reasons: 1. With our first birth, we had so many visitors and we’re just exhausted, 2. The flu season has been extended this year and weeks before several attendees of our baby shower came sick, and 3. Although, not a huge concern but still a concern- the measles outbreak. Plain and simple we wanted to protect baby’s health and bond while keeping our sanity. Anyway, baby arrives in May. Btw I ended up having to get induced before my due date because of complications that could have been life threatening. So we didn’t tell family members right away because we were so worried about everything else that was happening. As soon as we had a moment to breathe we notified MIL and sent a picture. Shortly after her mom calls my husband crying and making a huge fuss. Talking about it’s a tradition to visit the baby at the hospital. My husband felt horrible and called his mom to ask her what did she say. She claims she didn’t tell her about the birth but I’m pretty sure she did because we didn’t and my DH’s grandma has never called him in the morning on a week day, which is usually a day he would be at work. Anyway, DH gets yelled at by his mom while I’m taking a shower at the hospital. Next day we go home and I tell him let’s eat dinner and invite them over. He calls her and she hands the phone to his dad who then chews him out. It’s been over a month and she has not reached out to DH or tried to visit her granddaughter. DH says he doesn’t want to reach out. I am at a lost. What would you think? P.S. her mom/ grandma has visited and apologized for the outburst.",JUSTNOMIL
"I'm 12w pregnant today. My husband and I have some JN family members that're already starting to pry and gossip.

What can I say? I'm bored! Anyway, my husband came up with a diabolical plan to call our baby Clarence - no matter the gender - so we can keep the names a secret. You see, we don't want their opinions on names, they've been picked out since Nov. 2017, when we started trying. These people don't understand what boundaries are, and I can't wait to see their CBFs.

"Hi, so last year mil was obsessed with having me host something in our 2 bdrm apt 1.5 hour drive from where everyone else is. Obsessed to the point that she lost control of hosting Thanksgiving ""after 63 years"" by trying to foist it on me. Step DD (or simply DD 26 yr) stepped up and hosted very successfully (mil snuck 2 cups of her own left over gravy into an elaborate gravy that had been slaved over all day with a friend of family who loves to cook she had brought with vegetable water etc. (MIL later at the table asked me how I like her gravy .  I said ""it's GREAT"" and later told DD... weeks later. She didn't care..

Anyway, this year I hatched a plan to host a few different people in a nice house here on the lake which is rented out as a ""cabin/cottage"". So In-laws and DD&amp;BF arrived last night and it was really good. Our apt is one block away -  it's so great that she's OVER THERE now, as in not in my home - sigh of relief.  So later the 2 evil step-sisters come for a BBQ with one BF the invite said ""if you plan to bring friends please inform us and bring enough potluck to cover your friends. Sad that an invite to 40 yr old women has to spell that out but we have to it's happened they just bring friends for us to entertain so we'll see happens today. The MILO logic is to always be the perfect robot host. That makes you popular she figured that one out.  But mil expects that of everyone else too - hence the cabin - here ya go.

Later if there's any ganging up or any raised voices at all  I'm just going home. 

Minor BEC

1. While hubby dashed out for ice he was taking forever so I said I guess I could go home and start freshing up he should be back soon so she says woefully ""Okay we'll just sit here then"". After she just got her TV station figured out on the luxury sized flat screen TV.

When hubby suggests that he and I will take off for an hour to get ready, I say lioudly no we'll alternate so that we can entertain them, mil and FIL say, no no we don';t need you here we're fine.  In car husband grouchily says I just want to go home to a toke what was that all about I tell him about ""Okaaay, we'll just SIT here."": I think he got it that time a little less fog. 

&amp;#x200B;

2.MIL rubs in out faces that she won $500 when she went to the casino with our $50 gift cert she got for M-day. She proudly states she hasn't shared any I said, ""Where's my fee, ha ha - 4% right?"" FIL laughs and says, ""I don't even get to see any of it."" It's adorable because that's just who her 80 year old ass is. Lord save me, my dad lived to be 93. Mom was 88 so...

3.She pulls out her bar items and states, ""This is the fancy Tequila which SON gave me for my birthday. "" 

I mumble something like ""I'm sure it was from both of us."" (Honestly,  he prob did not say Loreike and I got you this because he's so whipped and in the fog.)  No acknowledgment to my statement, so I say louder,"" Yeah.. I got the bill for it!."" 

So she laughs and says, ""I'm sure you did,"" with big grin.  Just like her two daughters, as in -  what did I or can I get out of you? That's what pleases them take take take. 

4. Telling me I don't need to dry my hair that I look ""fine"".  We were delayed getting into the cabin by 2 hours due to the owners not leaving the key (groan) so I was way behind as I had an hour after work to prepare.  Our apt is one block away - so great she OVER THERE now, as in mot in my home - sigh.  So later the 2 evil step-sisters come. If there's any ganging up or yelling I'm just going home. I did just leave my wet hair twisted up and in a barette because it was so humid yesterday that felt cooler anyway it was 31C in central southern Canada.  I just straightened it when I got home at 10:30 hubby decided to pull the pin so that was good. 

5. Telling me I don't need to dig out the fire pit. I do it while they are inside .  Because A huge rain was coming, good, and we want to have fires there this week.  I';m not digging out the pit AFTER is soaking wet. 

So when she said LOREIKE just leave it, just leave it and come sit down, I's said, "" That's fine, That's fine.""  It seems to satisfy without making a commitment at all to their BS.   

And that's it.  So far so good.  I just have to imagine her as a naughty puppy dog who can't hurt me and must not be disciplined because she not my puppy not my circus, just deflect deflect but I must grey rock better today with the bitchy SIL's around. Last night speaking out on the tequila was very cheeky of me, but ended right where she felt she had ""won&lt;"". But at least &gt;I was acknowledged pretty much a first after 22 years of living in sin.

"TW: Sexual Assault

A commenter (I don't remember your name, I'm sorry!) brought up the idea of how JNMom could have shaped by her past.

JNMom was born in a third world country. She is the oldest of four (still living) siblings. Grandpa was an alcoholic and Grandma was a total narcissist. 

Even though my mom has never admitted it to me, I'm 99.99% she and her sister were victims of molestation and/or rape (she said my dad coveted me when I was a kid and she and her sister are paranoid about male family members around daughters)

Yet, I don't believe that excuses her narcissist behavior. When she found out I wanted to go on holiday with my now ex, she cried that I wasn't a virgin anymore. She also commented on my SO's bulge in his boxer briefs and still wants to get his underwear.

I'm sorry for the BEC post, but my mom is cray cray.",JUSTNOMIL
"There’s really no other way to describe what happened here. 

I never nested with my DD, but I have been a basket case over getting things organized with my current pregnancy. I went through all of my DD’s old things, sorted handmedowns for either keeping or donating, and trashed things that I couldn’t reuse. 

MIL is in our area on business and stopped by to visit. I was in the middle of a nesting purge and asked her to take some stuff out to the trash for me. Instead, she decided to go through it and pulled out a bunch of old, sort of gross items. 

MIL, holding DD’s old toothbrush: “You could use this for the twins.”

Me, incredibly appalled and thinking of the brand new, nice toothbrushes I have upstairs: “Are you insane?” 

MIL, trying again: “What about this snot sucker thing? You can still use it.” 

Me: “Nope, I’ve got all new, sanitary items for my kids. Thanks for playing.” 

MIL, sticking her head in then trash bag one last time: “What about these old pacifiers, surely you can always use those?” 

Me, annoyed as fuck: “MIL, those have been chewed on and are cracked. NO!”

"Alright, now time for part 2. Last time we left off everything was okay MIL apologized for going off on me rhat one night and I still wanted some distance between us, but I thought everything was okay. Then Mother's Day happened a few days later.

I had to work that day and I was kind of unhappy about it, but ya know, money. I sent MIL a happy mothers day text at work to be nice. She informed me that DH and LO were at the inlaws place visiting. I didn't really care since I was at work and just whatevered it. A couple hours later, DH sends me a text asking what I want to eat from a local restaurant in town. I assumed he was going to pay for his meal and mine. I told him and when I got home, it was there waiting for me.

It was only after I started eating that he told me MIL and FIL paid for it. Now, the night she went off, I told DH I wasn't going to accept anything else from them anymore so it wouldn't be held over my head. Had I known they were paying for the meal, I wouldn't have wanted anything. I was kind of upset, but I said it was nice and I would text them thank you later. Well, life with a baby happened and I got busy giving him a bath and putting him to bed since his bedtime is 8pm and I had gotten off work close to 6pm. Almost as soon as baby was in bed, DH and I both passed out watching Netflix and I never got to send the text.

The next day was a busy day at work and I was listening to music on my phone as I normally do while I'm working. At around 11am, I remembered the text to say thank you and pulled out my phone real quick. Guess who had already send me a text that said, ""You're welcome for dinner last night."" And just like that, shit hit the fan again.

I sent a text explaining what happened and how I was just about to and I was appreciative. No response. I knew she was pissed. I went home and told DH exactly what happened. He just brushed it off like it was no big deal, but I went back into panic mode for a few days when we didn't hear anything from them.

A few days later, I managed to get a day off work to spend with the family and the inlaws say they need to stop by and help us install a catflap (something we needed for the cats to have easy access to their litter box) that we asked them to help us with many weeks ago. I didn't want them to come by and ruin the day off I managed to get with the family, but like they always do, they didn't ask they just planned on doing it.

They arrive, I go outside to greet them and the first thing out of MIL's mouth is about how if I have a problem with their religion, then I needed to find another babysitter. Its worth noting that my inlaws are Jehovah's Witnesses. Both DH and I are no longer practicing, but grew up in the religion. DH still holds a lot of their beliefs, but I think of them like a toxic cult. But reguardless, I never judge anyone based on their religious beliefs. Just like if I had a babysitter that was Muslim and had to stop and play regularly, I wouldn't care as long as they take care of my son and there is no indoctrination (something I question them doing to my son though). I was stunned and it became very awkward after that because I knew she was pissy.

It was hot and humid out so eventually, I took LO inside to get him out of the heat and breastfeed him a bit. I get done and head back outside to hear MIL talking to DH about how tired she is of ""being the parent"" (a term she regularly uses for when she feels the need to insert herself as a parent uninvited). I knew she was talking about what I had been doing again and just bolted back into the house to stay out of it. I kind of hide in LO's room to stay out of it and keep myself from having another full blown panic attack while taking care of LO.

After they leave, DH tells me what happened. MIL still feels I am being selfish, inconsiderate, and unappreciative toward them and how having so much time off while DH was home taking care of our son made her realize how tired she was of taking care of him 50+hours a week (IT ONLY HAPPENED ONCE AND I TRIED TO AVOID IT!!!). 

•She was tired of ""having to be the parent"" (she thought I was starving LO because almost all the time I say I'm going to give him a snack or I just gave him a snack so she assumed I only ever fed him snacks instead of healthy meals and he ate a ton at their place even though he always eats a ton)

•he thought I spent way too much time on my phone while watching son (I look at my phone while breastfeeding and when he's distracted playing with toys I look)

• I was always lying (really I just don't tell her everything or she sometimes doesn't understand what I say and thinks I'm lying when really she just doesn't understand also see the first dot for an example of this)

•She was upset I don't call them ""mom"" and ""dad"" (I shit you not)

• I get defensive and pissy when they give me unsolicited advice

•That forgetting things was becoming a tiring excuse (if you read part 1 you will see why I was being understandably very forgetful at the time and am naturally a forgetful person. I always tell people, including them early in me and DH's relationship, that I am very forgetful about things)

And there was probably some other stuff too that I can't even remember rn. Straight up bananas tbh, but DH said it was best to just swallow my pride and apologize, going on to say that some of the things I did to them (getting defensive and pissy about unsolicited advice) I did to him. So I did what he asked and the next day, I text them asking if I could talk to them. I apologized about everything, promised to try and be better.

I also promised to start working less so they would only watch baby for 24 hours a week. This is a bit of a side story that happened sometime during this, but I will go into it in probably a part 3 since this is so long. Everything was okay until about a week ago with the ongoing vaccine bs. There are a lot more older stories I will keep posting about and I will give updates about the current events. Thank y'all for the support and valudating that I'm not the only one who thinks MIL is nuts.

Tl;dr- After everything in part one things were okay until I forgot to text MIL thank you for dinner that she bought without my knowledge. She then goes off again about how selfish and inconsiderate I am for a number of reasons (they are the bullets above). I bite my tongue and say sorry for it all to keep the peace.",JUSTNOMIL
"Obligatory throwaway because FDH knows my real username, and this is my first post! I’m looking for advice but please be gentle, I never thought I’d have to post here. 

Background: FDH and I have been together for 6 years, we met college and now we are temporarily living in FDH’s home state. It is the state we went to college in, but in an apartment that happens to be close to his parents. 

We have been saving to move to where I am from since it’s cheaper, there’s good jobs, and I miss sweet tea. FMIL and FFIL know we have plans to move down there. They didn’t seem opposed except for FMIL’s tragic “oh nooooo, my baby wants to leave. I guess I will have to deal with the fact we are growing apart geographically” which I honestly thought was a joke the first time. 

Every time the future is brought up now, she insinuates she would be coming with us! I guess there’s no reason she can’t live in the same state, but I just feel like we missed a conversation or two in between those conclusions. 

Then, finally the reason I’m coming to you today is that yesterday she randomly mentions that one day she would be living in our backyard! We would “obviously” build a small house for her out back (“she doesn’t need much”) and she could take care of the grandkids (?!!!??) while FDH and I go to work. Grandkids have never been mentioned, ever. Not that we don’t want them someday, but FDH and I aren’t even married (though I hope to be in a year or two!) Also I noticed she doesn’t include FFIL in any of her future plans.

I don’t know if I’m overreacting to her dreamed plans that are years and years away. Especially since shes bad at following through with any plans she makes. I just don’t know what to say to her in these situations, and the closer we get to moving the more often they tend to pop up.

Edit: Thank you for your comments! I’m reading every single one and doing my best to respond. 

An excellent point has been brought up multiple times, FDH and I are very much on the same page. The only person who wants her to move in less than me is him, your advice is so helpful because neither of us know what to do about it. 

Also on the FFIL front: He has said multiple times that he wants to die in their current house (which is dramatic because they aren’t that old yet). FMIL and him haven’t slept in the same bed for 25 years. It’s not my place to say but I think they stay married out of convenience. I have a theory that she would happily leave him if she could find someone else to latch onto, ie FDH and I.",JUSTNOMIL
"Ftp, ltl, mobile.

Background; I have an 11 month old and am currently 5.5 months pregnant. My fiance's mother has said she cant wait for my 11 month old daughter to come spend nights (7 is her hope) and that's not happening as fiance and I discussed it, plus this is the SECOND time I've met the woman. (Been w fiance for 2 years, engaged for about 3 months.) 

To the story, I feel like I'm being a bit emotional and need a bit of advice. 2 minutes into being in her home with MIL she picks up my daughter and we reminded her no face kissing. She instead kissed the back of her head which is fine with me. 

My daughter was poopy and she said something, to which I held my hands out like a normal mother so I can change her, because shes my daughter, I dont let too many other people change her and again this is the SECOND time meeting her in person while mostly being ignored by his family. MIL told me that she would change her to which I felt my face flush hot and tears sting because WHO TELLS THE MOTHER OF THE CHILD THAT THEYLL CHANGE THE DIAPER WHEN MAMA IS ASKING FOR THEIR CHILD BACK.

I looked at fiance and basically growled to go get my baby and he chased her to the back room. I dont know what was said but she came over and handed my child to me, telling me that while we are here, I need to learn to share. I know how to share MY child. I dont like being told that I cant have her back. I'm also iffy about other people changing her and even changing her in public because I was sexually assaulted at 2 years old BY MY SPERM DONER. I think I'm allowed to have reservations about MY children. Also, MIL has said that she has our work schedules worked out and I'm a stay at home mother. Oh, and special thing, said that if fiance and I tried to leave her, we would have a shotgun pointed at our heads and even though it was a joke, I felt mega uncomfortable.

So tell me honestly, do you think I'm overreacting as a mama bear or is it actually BEC?

Thank you

Tldr; mil told me I cant have my child to change her even though it was clear that that's MY child and a SHY mama's girl",JUSTNOMIL
"Trigger warning- Sexual abuse

This story is ongoing and very emotionally charged but I'm at a loss right now and I need advice.
June of last year my DH and I welcomed our third child. We were exhausted and needed help as we were juggling 3 kids under 5. My MIL left for Germany the day I had my baby, leaving my FIL at home (this trip was pre-planned, baby was not planned). My FIL asked to keep my 4 yr old overnight, we obliged even though i felt something was off. Long story short he used this opportunity to sexually assault my child. I learned of the assault 2 days later, immediately notified the police and CPS. The case was investigated and found to be indicated by CPS but no criminal charges were filed as a 4 year old is not considered a credible witness. Prior to this event we were pretty close to MIL and FIL, with MIL babysitting once a week and both MIL and FIL getting my daughter on the bus 2 days/week. After the event my MIL initially was horrified and was ready to divorce FIL. After she came back my FIL went MIA and had 'suicidal ideations'. He was admitted to the local hospital for 7 days and released. We went NC with FIL immediately after we were notified of the incident, and eventually went VLC with MIL as she decided to stand by FIL and denies the event. This transitioned to NC as she decided she was going to support FIL and turned an about-face and now did not believe my child's reiteration of the event.
Good Friday we received paperwork from family court, my ILs are suing us for visitation of our 3 children. My youngest they have each only met 2 times, my middle is currently 2.5 and does not remember them and my oldest does not want to see grandpa but misses grandma. My husband and I hired a lawyer, but we are now doubting his abilities. We attended the initial hearing, a law guardian was assigned to the children, we met with law guardian, court met again but my husband and I didn't attend as we were both working, both the judge and our lawyer told us we didn't need to attend (bad idea, I know). The Judge is not convinced any inappropriate behavior exists despite an indicated CPS report and knowledge that my daughter is in trauma counseling with the counselor able to testify that there was in fact inappropriate contact!! The outcome of that meeting was visits with grandpa are off the table at this time. PHEW!! Now down to my dilemma: We go back to court at the end of this month, WTF do I do? We offered MIL court-supervised visits with (now) 5 yr old. She countered with UNSUPERVISED visits with all 3 children ((((HELL NOOOOOOOO)))). Law guardian suggested supervised visits with 5 yr old only at last court session. My husband and I countered with us providing supervision for visits, every 8 weeks. The lawyers spoke on the phone yesterday and our lawyer agreed to 2 visits 1-2 hours in length within the next 3 weeks prior to us going back to court!! I am at the end of my rope with this shit. I do not want to see her, but NYS seems to think they know better and children NEEEEEEED their grandparents...

I emailed my lawyer back and said I would attempt to make a plan for 1 visit within the next 3 weeks. I am afraid that 2 visits will set a precedence. This entire process is damaging and intrusive to our home life. I am so worried FIL will show up to visits, drop MIL off to visits, and my main concern is they will kidnap my child! To add to my stress I will need to find an appropriate caregiver for my other two children as I DO NOT want them involved in visitation. Any and all advice is wanted/needed. Please be kind.",JUSTNOMIL
"Things have been pretty quiet the last 2 weeks, which has been great. I've done some individual therapy and some couples therapy with DH. 


Even with the history of Obliviouranus behaving inappropriately/bullying/abusively (see BitchBot) both therapists are encouraging DH and DD to see Obliviouranus for a supervised visit next Friday. I've tried everything I can to stop this from happening.  Obliviouranus is currently in our town/state for 8 days. The fact the meeting is happening on the day before she leaves is the only win I've had.


My individual psychologist has suggested for my peace of mind that I go to this supervised visit as well, even though I've made the decision to go no contact from Obliviouranus for an extended period of time. FWIW I haven't told Obliviouranus that I'm no contact. I simply haven't bothered to respond to her pathetic DARVO email from about 2 weeks ago. 


What advice do you have for the supervised visit?  Go with DH and DD or don't? If I go, any tips for how to manage the time I have to be in the same room as that bitch without feeding her narc supply AND keeping DD safe?


EDIT 1: A few people are saying the same thing in the comments about why should Obliviouranus be rewarded with a visit at all. I agree 100% with this train of thought. However, so far I have banned Obliviouranus from staying at our place for the 8 days she's in our town/state (this is a first) and prevented her from seeing DD until the day before she flies back to her state. I've gained a lot of ground so far. 


The general consensus from DH and the therapists is that she will only see DD for 1 hour for a supervised visit in a public location, and that's pretty much going to be the extent of the face to face contact for her and DD this year. The visit is happening, I'm looking for advice on how to handle that.


EDIT 2: I realised I didn't explain the therapists positions clearly so here it is. The couple's therapist is advocating for positive reinforcement. Obliviouranus has agreed to our boundaries and so far has respected them. Therapist believes we should encourage that behaviour to continue by offering the 1 hour supervised visit. If boundaries are broken then the visit ends immediately. My individual therapist is of the position that if the visit is going to happen then I need to be there to enforce the boundaries, end the visit if needed, and give off some heavy ""don't fuck with me vibes"".",JUSTNOMIL
"As my previous posts have stated, I am DONE with this woman and her husband. They have caused so much stress and drama into mine and DH’s lives for the last six years. After a confrontation with both, DH went no contact. I had already gone no contact before that. 

We have both blocked his parents and have been trying to heal and move the hell on. Of course, his aunts and uncle have called trying to get him to see his mother at least, but DH has said “no thanks, he’s good for now.”

BUT then, I found out last night that his mother called MY parents to wish them a happy eid. Again, one of the reasons my in-laws don’t like me is because I am MUSLIM and they are Christian. Now, my MIL rarely calls my parents or wants to see them. 

Turns out, that not only does she call them, she tries to set up a dinner with them. My parents did not know all the details of what went down or that we had gone no contact with DH’s parents so they talked like normal. 

I’m SO pissed that this woman is now trying to hang out with my family when NEITHER of us want to talk to her. I don’t want to open the communication channels to tell her to back off yet again, but I don’t know what the freaking hell to do?! 

I don’t want her involving my parents into her drama. My parents are super old, sick, and don’t need additional stress on their plates. How do I get JUSTNOMIL to leave me and my family alone?",JUSTNOMIL
"Trigger Warning: Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault.

I was pretty distraught after my last post and considered not posting again. The overwhelming majority of the not so gentle advice I got on a post asking for no advice was to give my SO an ultimatum--she goes or I do. I can recall only one compassionate commenter softening the blow and suggesting that I not end my relationship but simply say that we should live separately while he is helping his mother. I understand where everyone is coming from. I understand that the concern is that she will always be a problem as long as she is in his life. I understand the concerns; for the most part, I agree. MIL is a manipulative monster, full stop. I am the open target, but I am not the only target. I didn't find the prevailing advice helpful and it honestly just deepened the emotion hole I was already in. The comments made me feel hopeless in a situation that already had me feeling beaten and low. It has taken me a while to even come back to vent.

I have started to polish my spine.

I removed myself from the situation for another week, housesitting for vacationing friends to care for their pets and take care of their plants etc... Before I left MIL started crying to SO that she shouldn't have to go to therapy because she is tired of talking about her past and she doesn't understand why her regular dr. can't just keep prescribing her cocktail (of 8!) benzos, SSRIs, Antipsychotics, Sedatives, Narcotics, and Adderall without the consulting a psychiatrist or speaking to a trauma counselor. I am in no way shaming her, I am concerned that she is doing nothing to get over what happened and using her victim status to manipulate everyone around her. I told SO that she had to go to counseling or one of us couldn't live in this apartment anymore. He assured me that if it came to that, his mother would be leaving.

As I alluded to in my first post, I am a survivor of physical and emotional abuse and intimate partner sexual assault. I have fought tooth and nail to get my life back and have come a long way, but some days coping is the hardest thing in the world. I struggle with depression and anxiety that inhibits my ability to function like a normal human being some days. I cannot take medication for it because my body cannot tolerate antidepressants. It is incredibly difficult to watch her use her victimhood as a crutch and excuse to justify her behavior and not want to take the steps to heal and move on.

All of this is just exacerbated by her other behaviors and general haunting of my life. She is a Gray Lady. She mopes around all day unless I engage with her about bettering her health (either mental or physical) in which case she gets defensive and speaks to me like I am a stupid child. That tone and looking at me like I am an idiot rile me up like no other. Any other time, she is basically helpless; for example, the buttons for crosswalks that have indicator arrows confuse her.  I am sure most of it is learned, but I can’t do anything about that.

In the week that I was back home before leaving again, we moved squarely into BEC territory. everything she does annoys me. I am still an anxious wreck because she moves things slightly out of place and purposefully disrupts the routines that help me cope, but I am now at a point where I notice every little thing. Current annoyances include using her SNAP benefits to only buy soda and junk food and bringing into a home that is trying to establish healthy eating habits. A complete inability to hold a conversation beyond a single exchange and then looking at you like you are an idiot while waiting for her to respond. Using my bedroom mirror to take selfies for Facebook and Snapchat like I can't tell from the background that she is in my bedroom when I am not there. Not wearing headphones while listening to music or videos on her phone/ keeping her notifications and ringtones at full volume. And addressing SO for everything including things about me in front of me like I am a non-person and not standing right there. But that is my fault because I am hard to talk to and she never knows what will upset me.

Thursday was her Birthday. She hinted all day that she wanted me to tell her Happy Birthday. I didn't. Because I'm petty. I picked out the gift that SO gave her but managed to get through the entire day without obligatory Birthday wishes. I am counting it as a small victory.

The real kicker was on Tuesday. She was out with her friend, and I was alone, so I decided to recommit to my workout routine at home. During the warmup she came home. I was like, *this is no big deal, as long as she stays in her room I will be fine.* she comes back out, asks me for my keys so that she can go get the mail, I say fine. She comes back with a toddler that I have never seen before. Let that sink in. SHE WENT TO GET THE MAIL AND CAME BACK WITH A RANDOM 4-YEAR-OLD!!! Does not ask me if its okay to bring this child whom I have never met into my home does say a single word to me beyond “here is your mail” like it’s nothing.

I had one of the worst panic attacks I have ever had. I had no idea who this kid was. He could have gotten hurt, He could have said that I had done something to him or his parent could accuse me of something... Any number of bad things could come from this. I immediately shut myself in my room to get my breathing under control and text my SO about everything. He had to leave work to come home and deal with the situation.  I was shaking and crying on the phone with my own mom until he got home. It turns out that the kid was Gary Lady’s friends’ grandkid. A friend that I have met in passing once.  The friend that she constantly tells how badly I treat her. The one she complains to that I am an awful DIL that mistreats her. Which terrifies me even more. I don’t want to believe that someone would weaponize a kid like that, but I am legitimately scared. 

Since then, we have a list of written rules in place. She has yet to follow one to the letter. SO has given her no money this month. He has promised me that he will decide on a reasonable deadline for her to leave by the 15th which means she will have been in my home for 3 months. And he has been taking a firmer stance when speaking to her and telling her that her behavior is out of line when she is disrespectful towards me. I am officially No Contact with her even though he lives in my house. She is not to speak to at all. 

I feel like the tide is starting to turn and if she keeps her shenanigans up, I will get my home back. It gives me hope.",JUSTNOMIL
"This is small fish compared to the rest of the stuff here, but I need somewhere to vent because it's just simmering at this point. I haven't been able to find reliable work, despite putting out applications whenever possible. In the meantime I've been accepting commissions whenever possible so I can have a little bit saved up and pay for mine and my rats' needs. Yet, I can't actually *work* on these commissions because I'm watching my sisters, and by the time I'm done, I'm too exhausted to even get out a proper sketch, let alone line or paint. These art commissions are also why I'm very protective and possessive over my laptop.

The past two weeks I've spent enough time watching my sisters to have made a couple hundred bucks if I was charging for it. Today I've spent more time watching my sisters than I've had time to work on my commissions. I basically just had a lunch break before my mom left again. I'm starting to feel like an asshole, because I'm resenting watching my sisters all the time. Yeah, I may not have a job, and she likes to point that out whenever I bring up how often she has me watch my siblings. Yelling at me over how I don't have a job doesn't make one magically appear for me to work at. Holding it over my head doesn't change the local job market, either.

I'm getting sick of bringing it up to her only to have her disregard what I said because I'm not pulling in reliable income. She uses this to justify dumping my sisters on me whenever, and then lying about what she's doing and how long she's going to be gone for. Like saying she's only getting a few things, and then comes back from 3-4 different stores hours later with a dozen bags of groceries, and oh, she visited her sister, too. Or that she's only dropping something off to X family member and be right back, only to end up spending hours chatting with them before going and picking up more groceries.

I get that we need food, but I can't fucking get my work done when I'm watching them, and she doesn't get that. I can't have them pulling or yanking on my tablet cord, because I can't afford to replace it right away if it gets broken. I can't have them bumping me, or making me jump. I bring these things up to her, and she waves it off and says she'll talk to them to make sure they listen; plot twist, it doesn't work. They are not the perfect angels she tries to sell them as. One of them nearly ruined my laptop when she kicked it off the table because she was wanted something. It was stuck in a reboot loop for \~12 hours and if it wouldn't start I was fucked because all of my art and programs are on it. 

When I told her about it she said ""tough shit"" and went on about how when I was a kid I ruined a lot of keyboards. A $450 laptop with a \~$60 art program is not the same as a fucking keyboard. So basically saying she wouldn't pay full price for me to replace it. I learned my lesson and no longer try to work on stuff while watching them. She also goes on about how it's my responsibility to watch them, and I want to scream because they *are not my kids*. They are my siblings and I love them, but I can't keep being her free on call babysitter. I feel selfish saying that, but I need to be able to feed my rats and get them medical care.",JUSTNOMIL
"I posted this a few hours ago but it was deleted or locked (not sure if there is a difference?) but I was getting a lot of good information from commenters especially regarding ideas for new cell phone providers and possibly advice in how to go about selling my vehicle (which is in my name) so I am reposting it:

 

I got a letter in the mail stating that my billing address for my car insurance has changed to where I am now.

I didn't want a car - I wanted a really nice bike I could also go through winter with but my parents said that I needed a car so I can easily come visit them 3 hours away.

I guess now that I'm not talking to my mother, they are rescinding their agreement to pay my insurance. I suspect she liked being thanked. Now that I'm not talking to her, she can't be thanked either, I guess.

I just feel like this is a way to attempt to get me to contact her again and to keep me financially dependent. Like she is expecting me to break because I cannot afford the insurance that they have on it (which is Really good).

I talked to my partner and he is going to help me search for an insurance deal to get just the bare minimum coverage for what I need legally so it will be alright. She just makes me feel unsafe. My phone is also under my dad's plan but my mother pays the bills for that, too. When I was 16, I graduated HS early and she had me sign up for the Disney Career Start program. I came back early w/o her permission because I had a colleague who attempted to sexually assault/rape me several times and I didn't feel safe. I didn't tell her why I wanted to come back and I didn't know back then that I should have reported him, I just told her that I needed to and she told me to stick it out. One of my friends drove down to FL from WI to get me and when I got back, she was so angry, she locked me out of the house and canceled my phone plan. I had to stay with my friend and his family. She called his mother a few weeks later in tears saying that she cannot stand that I wouldn't talk to her. What? You canceled my cell phone and wouldn't allow me in the house, clearly you did not want to speak to me.

That call convinced his mother that I couldn't stay with them because it would be 'getting in between family' so he found me a room with his brother on the other side of town.

I kind of want her to cancel my phone plan. Then I wouldn't be financially dependent on them whatsoever but, also, I'm so poor. Thankfully every time I go to a psych or therapist it's only $30.00 so that will not have to be sacrificed. If anything, my partner will help me still see a therapist because he wants me to be safe physically and mentally. Because he's great. I wish my mom was...",JUSTNOMIL
"So, I came here a few weeks ago while living with what I had hoped to be my FUTURE MIL.

&amp;#x200B;

I met her son (online)\[who for ease, I will call my SO\] and we fell in love (awe, the things we do for love).  We both felt and agreed that once we were living together we could do anything, and achieve our ""team"" dreams, relationship goals\[that being 3,000 miles away from each other was just too far and too tiring on our souls\].

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are 100 % out of the picture.  His parents are 100 % in the picture (although divorced, they are all in the same city and cordial).  I was in Los Angeles, CA, in an apartment.  He was in Richmond, VA, living in his mom's house.

&amp;#x200B;

My living situation in Los Angeles, CA was less than ideal.  In fact, I spent a lot of time complaining to him about it.  He finally had the courage to ask his mom if I could stay in her 4 bedroom/3 bathroom house.  She was hesitant, but finally agreed\[and when I say hesitant, I mean she told her son ""yes"" and then ""no"" and then ""yes"" again\].

&amp;#x200B;

I took the final ""yes"" and ran with it to get out of Los Angeles, CA, and start my life over ""hit the reset"" and have him in my life finally.  I was so happy to finally not be on the phone with him and just look at him, see him, talk to him.

&amp;#x200B;

Caveat: I did know it was a little odd for a middle-aged man to be living at home with his mom, but I understood he had some life struggles (and I, as well, have had some life struggles).  He always reassured me that he had lived out of his mom's house from the time he was in the U.S. Marines until the time his ex-gf \[who for ease, I will call ""S""\] and him decided to move in with his mom to save money(they had dated 5 years and we serious).  I also understood he ""might"" be a ""mamma's boy"" and I was okay with that part of him.  In fact, I was open to sharing him happily with his mother.

&amp;#x200B;

At that moment, the moment I decided to drive across the country to be with him in Richmond, VA, after his mom gave it a second ""thumbs up,"" he had a part-time job and was seriously looking for a full-time job.  I, on the other hand, had no job and had just finished taking my CA Bar exam.  I was going to start looking for a part-time job in LA while waiting for my bar results, when I decided to drive to VA.

&amp;#x200B;

I was elated.  Overjoyed.  He let me know his mom was really ""laid back"" and ""chill.""  That ""S"" lived in the F. MIL's house for 1 year, and that his younger brother, had at least 2 girlfriends, who at various points in time, lived in the F. MIL's house.    So, I said, ""Okay. I trust you,"" and I packed everything I owned into my car (got rid of the rest) and I drove East into the sunrise.

&amp;#x200B;

So, when I arrived, I took 2-3 days to just sleep, rest, and get over the drive.  It was quite the whirlwind from bar studies, to bar exam, to within less than a week, driving across the country.

&amp;#x200B;

The first few days were fine.  I barely saw the mom.  She was accommodating.  He, my SO, was also accommodating.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what happened?

&amp;#x200B;

Day 4: I decided to clean the house\[specifically, the common areas, e.g., the kitchen and the bathrooms\] a little bit.

I told my SO and my F. MIL, there is nothing wrong with the house, and please do not feel insulted by my cleaning, b/c I am not trying to insult anyone here, however, I just want to handle a few things for myself to feel more comfortable living  here.

\[Now between us on Reddit here: I cringed the first few nights taking a shower---the shower walls had probably not been cleaned in over 5 years, e.g., dead-skin, mildew, mold, etc. caked on the walls.  When I cleaned it, I couldn't even get it off with a sponge.  I had to get a heavy brush (and I bought a face mask) to clean it.\]

&amp;#x200B;

The F. MIL seemed ecstatic to have someone cleaning for her.  She went on and on to me about how her ""good-for-nothing"" adult kids don't do anything for her\[she is talking about my SO and his sister\].

&amp;#x200B;

Then, she proceeds to start pointing things out to me that she ""hated"" and thought were ""gross"" in her house \[specifically, her toilets had brown residue; the rubber blocker to the garbage disposal; the oven\].  She claimed that she was just so busy with work that she couldn't clean her house.  She also told me she did not know ""how"" to clean.  Moreover, she told me, she would get maids, but doesn't see the point, and she is just too cheap for that service, especially since the house will just get dirty again, so why bother? Lol.

&amp;#x200B;

I told her I could simply not single handed clean a 4 bedroom/3 bathroom house that no one has cleaned in 10 years, maybe more.  She said, ""Oh, no, of course not, anything is appreciated, but if you can do this, this, and that, if would be appreciated.""

&amp;#x200B;

I told her, ""Hey, I just got here. I do not have a job yet.  I am living in your home, rent free.  I want to show you that I care and I am not a user, so let me help you.""  She said, ""Okay, anything, but just so you know, no one is forcing you to do anything, but I do want to point some things out to you.

&amp;#x200B;

So I ended up helping her, alright.   FOR 6 WEEKS.  Yes, I cleaned my F MIL house, Monday-Sunday, for \~8 hours per day, b/c I wanted to please her so bad, and I wanted her to like me so bad.  I was a guest in her house doing what I could to make her happy.

&amp;#x200B;

But the cleaning to please her it not why I am here VENTING.  The 6 weeks of non-stop cleaning her house wasn't what made me ""RUN FOR THE HILLS,"" even though I care so much for her son, my SO.

&amp;#x200B;

So, here it goes:  10 WEEKS FROM HELL

&amp;#x200B;

WEEK 1:  I came outside one a.m. to find that my car windshield had been SHATTERED.  No tree branch, wood pieces all over the ground around the car.  No sign of how it happened.  No evidence.  Some wood branches in the corner of the F. MIL's backyard.

&amp;#x200B;

My SO was at his part-time job when it happened, so I had my F. MIL come see the damage and her response was to ""call your car insurance company, b/c its probably only $ 50.00.  And don't worry b/c it's just stuff, and things break and get damaged, but they can be fixed.""  I said to F. MIL, ""Yeah, you're right.  I am still shocked, but yeah, let me call my insurance agent.""  Turns out I have a $ 500.00 deductible.  So, I was going to go ""out-of-pocket.""

&amp;#x200B;

My F. MIL dropped me off at her SO's work, she offered to drive me there, which she did, and talk to him, and discuss how we were going to pay for it, as well as pick his car up to drive for the day.  He was literally in shock, but he offered to pay for it with Safe-Lite.  He told his mom he was going to pay for it, and she swooped in and paid for half of it.  Yes, my F. MIL paid $ 200.00 on a new windshield costing $ 400.00.

&amp;#x200B;

I said to myself, ""Wow, what a nice mom, and a nice woman.""

&amp;#x200B;

And then as she drove out of the parking lot to his work, she called me on my cell phone.  I picked up and said ""Hi.""  She said, ""Hi \_\_\_\_, look if you are going to be driving my son's car, I just want to tell you ""be careful, b/c we wouldn't want anything bad happening to you.""  I said, ""Oh, thank you F. MIL, I appreciate your concern for my well-being.  Rest assured, I am a good driver.  She replied, ""Yeah, I would hate to see you get hurt.""  My reply, ""Uh, of course, absolutely, thank you so much for all your kindness.""  ::Hangs up phone::

\[Runs over to SO, tells his that his mom just called me a literally ""threatened me, indirectly,"" which makes me think she ""busted"" my windshield with a tree branch in a NARC RAGE/BORDERLINE RAGE moment.\] But, what do you know, my SO completely disagrees.  He claims that I have C-PTSD from my own upbringing, and my last relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, you're right, SO.  You and your mom fixed my windshield.  Its over.  Thank you. Thank your mom.  I am grateful to have you both in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

But for week 1-4. you want to know who couldn't let it go...His MOM.  She kept bringing it up to me, ""I just don't know why you have enemies, you seem like such a nice person.""  Do you think the wind did it and a tree branch fell on your car, or do you think a person did it?""  I told her multiple times, a person did it...there was no tree branch anywhere, and the Safe Lite repairman (who does this for a living) says it was probably ""vandalism.""

&amp;#x200B;

Moving on...

&amp;#x200B;

WEEK 2:  My SO keeps getting a lot of late night texts from his mom.  He seems annoyed.  I asked him what was the problem.  It was the TV noise, okay, so we turned it down.  Then a day later, more texts from mom.  We are talking too loud late a night and it is keeping her awake.  Okay, so we keep our voices down.  A day later, she is talking to him in person about the ""shower"" making too much noise in the hallway.  No more showers after 11 p.m.  Okay, fine.  A day later, she is texting him again, this time, she is asking him and me to not flush the toilet anymore after 11 p.m.  The flushing noise is bothering her.  She can't sleep if she keeps hearing the toilet flush.  No B.S. -- a day later, she is yelling out her shut bedroom door for her son.  I said, ""Hey honey, your mom is yelling for you?""  He goes, ""Yeah mom, is everything okay?"" My F. MIL, ""No, it's not, you are walking too loud in the hallway...can you try to walk quietly, thank you.""

&amp;#x200B;

I think my head almost exploded....WALK MORE QUIETLY....on old wooden floors that need repair....?  But her son, my SO, said, ""Okay mom, no problem.""

&amp;#x200B;

Everything with him is, ""Okay, mom. Sure, mom. Yes, mom.""  It is his path of least resistance.  A coping mechanism he must have learned in his childhood.

&amp;#x200B;

WEEK 3:  My F. MIL is removing my clothes, as well as her sons clothes (that I am in charge of cleaning now, since I am the jobless one) from the dryer \[even though she hang dries her clothes in the backyard\].  You have no reason to touch the dryer then F. MIL. Odd move on her part, but okay, whatever.

Then, my soap in the soap dish in the shower \[Yes, the 3 of us all share 1 shower stall b/c she has blocked her Master Bathroom shower off in her Master Bedroom with yarn,fabric, and other items\] went down the drain twice this week.

&amp;#x200B;

My bath towel kept falling off the towel rack \[the one she designated for me above the toilet, its a tiny hallway bathroom\] and onto the ground next to the toilet.  Okay, weird, but whatever.  I just moved my towel into the bedroom.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: She also designated a drawer for me in the bathroom.  I put my stuff in there, but after I realized that someone else was using my expensive ""hyper-sensitive skin"" moisturizer, I had to move that to the bedroom too.

&amp;#x200B;

Around this point, my F. MIL gave me a lecture about sharing in the kitchen.  How she is a ""cool, laid-back mom,"" and mi casa, es su casa.  I was wondering where is she going with this conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

Then she opens the fridge to show me that she has labeled all of her stuff ""mom.""  Drink caps, ""MOM,"" drink front, ""MOM.""

&amp;#x200B;

I heard her out.  I told her, I don't drink ""diet"" anything.  It is your lovely son, who may be drinking your drinks, I will let him know.  And don't worry F. MIL, I won't touch your drinks, since I know you love to share, and you just told me sharing is caring, which is why you are labeling everything, but again, it's not me, but no worries, I'll pass the message along either way.

&amp;#x200B;

WEEK 4:  On my birthday, I was doing some laundry.  My F. MIL stopped my load, again, of my clothes and her son's clothes...to throw 1 dirty kitchen towel inside the washing machine, EVEN though there was a basket of bath and kitchen towels waiting to be washed on the ground.  My F MIL, when confronted by SO, claimed that the 1 kitchen towel needed to be washed immediately, even though she has like 30 + kitchen towels in a drawer in her kitchen.

&amp;#x200B;

WEEK 5:  My wireless Bluetooth headphones that my SO gave me for my birthday have suddenly gone ""missing.""  I am 100 % certain that I left them on kitchen counter.  The F. MIL seemingly concerned for my lost item exclaims, ""THEY'RE PROBABLY IN MY BACKYARD SOMEWHERE.""  I keep telling her....No, no, and no again.  I was not in your backyard at all yesterday, today, or even tomorrow.  I don't go in your backyard.

&amp;#x200B;

Why would the headphones be out there?

&amp;#x200B;

Her son, my SO, finally spoke up, I couldn't believe her had the courage to say something to her, and he said, ""Mom, she wasn't in the backyard at all...why would they be there?  She says she left them on kitchen counter.  This is literally the 6th or 7th time I have heard you tell my gf that they're in the backyard.""  The F. MIL reply, ""Oh, Idk, I am just trying to be helpful. But if you don't want my help....that's fine. ::as she knits from the living room couch::""

&amp;#x200B;

Her help is saying that they are in her backyard somewhere, even though she won't get off the couch to help me or her son look for them b/c that is beneath her.

&amp;#x200B;

I am starting to see a trend at this point of her ""feigning"" concern.

&amp;#x200B;

WEEK 7:  I had complained to SO that someone had been coming into his childhood bedroom when he is not home and I am not home and going through my personal property.  Some of my items had been slightly moved, and I happened to notice.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what did I do?  I bought a camera.  Oh yes, I do not have kids nor a dog, but I wasted money on a camera out of paranoia.

&amp;#x200B;

My SO was determined that I was wrong about his mom snooping around in the bedroom.

&amp;#x200B;

Boy, oh boy, was he in for a surprise!!!

&amp;#x200B;

And to my HUGE SURPRISE too, it was his 36 yo, married w/ kids SISTER, who was SNOOPING around in her older brother's childhood bedroom \[and specifically, going through my stuff\].  Then, she sees the camera, and she sees that she got CAUGHT, thus she pretends that she is looking at some family photos on the wall, and takes off.  BUSTED!!!

&amp;#x200B;

I was shocked, literally, she is 36 yo, why on earth would you care to be snoopy.  If she was 10-22 years of age, I would give her a pass on this behavior, but it seemed so abnormal for her age.

&amp;#x200B;

I showed my SO the footage, he was stunned, but didn't want to do anything about it.  He did not want to talk to his sister about it.  He didn't even want to talk to his mom about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I said, I love you to death SO, but someone needs to talk to your sister, and I think it should be you as her older brother.  Just a real quick talk. She hasn't lived here in your mom's house since she was 31 yo (in 5 years).  This is not her house nor her room nor her property.  She lives with her husband (55 yo) and her 5 yo daughter in her husband's house (5 minutes away).  This is beyond weird.

&amp;#x200B;

BUT nobody says anything to the sister.  Nothing...swept under the rug, like it never happened.

&amp;#x200B;

I told my SO, okay, now that you believe me, I am switching out the door handle, and I am putting a lock on the door.  I am not messing around anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

WEEK 10 (2 days ago): The F. MIL is banging on her son's bedroom door at 8 a.m.  Her son has already left for his new full-time job (since I took over all the other life responsibilities, including, but not limited to, all the laundry, all the cleaning, all the dishes, all the errands, he was able to focus entirely on just getting a full-time job).  He leaves the house at 6 a.m. and doesn't come home until 7 p.m.

&amp;#x200B;

\[Side Note: The F. MIL is 65 yo and just recently retired (WEEK 8), she went on a week long vacation (WEEK 9---The best week of my life in her house---it's almost like the clouds parted and the sun came out) and then she came back just 3 days ago.\]

&amp;#x200B;

So, there is my F. MIL, and she is banging at 8 a.m. ---I wake up, my alarm is set for 9 a.m.  I had stayed up late the night before trying to study for the Bar again, trying to play catch up.  So, I didn't sleep well, or right, and she is banging relentlessly.  I take my ear plugs out, and I go, ""Yes.""

&amp;#x200B;

So, she says, ""Hi, I am really sorry to bother you, were you sleeping?""

&amp;#x200B;

I said, ""I was sleeping, but not anymore, how are you, is everything okay?""

&amp;#x200B;

She says, ""No, the top shelf of the top cabinet just came crashing down out of nowhere, and it was all YOUR glass pasta sauce, glass of enchilada sauce, etc...It made a HUGE mess.  And I am so overwhelmed. I don't know how or why this happened.  I was just on the phone talking to my daughter minding my own business, when all of a sudden --- I heard the crash and an explosion of glass.  OMG, it is such a huge mess.  I am going to need your help, can you please come and clean it up?""

&amp;#x200B;

I said, ""Oh okay, sure..Let me get some clothes and some sneakers on.""

&amp;#x200B;

I go down the kitchen the one that only I have been maintaining and cleaning for everyone over the last 10 weeks.  BIGGEST MESS EVER!!!

&amp;#x200B;

And it looks fishy...looks like she walked around in it, and her foot prints are everywhere.""

&amp;#x200B;

So, from 8 a.m. until 10:30 a.m. I help her clean it up.  At some point, she did walk off to have a 30-minute break and chit-chat with her ""snoopy"" daughter on the phone while I was in there busting myself cleaning it up.

&amp;#x200B;

Later in the day, my F. MIL finally had to leave to go to a funeral (for her ex-MIL of her ex-husband, and was super annoyed she had to ""save face"" and attend the event).  Yes, she did complain to me about going to a funeral.

&amp;#x200B;

So, when she was gone...I  tried  to recreated the ""scenario"" of ""what happened"" --- her claims about ""what happened.""

And my conclusion was and still is ""huge B.S.""

&amp;#x200B;

I took a peg out of the wall and NOTHING the shelf didn't even move an inch.  I pulled on the front of the shelf, and had no collapsing movement.

&amp;#x200B;

BUT regardless of whether she did it, or did not, I cannot 100 % prove it.

&amp;#x200B;

But I am certainly suspicious and just PEEVED OFF at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

THESE COVERT PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE NARC GAMES OR BORDERLINE PUNISHMENTS --- FOR ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED SLIGHTS ---- ARE JUST BEYOND BELIEF.  They make your head spin, they are the stuff of crazy making.

&amp;#x200B;

I packed my property and I moved out.  No, I tip-toed out of there, quietly.  Her son, my SO, asked me a few times to stay, but he did not seem heart broken about my leaving.  He seemed indifferent.  Maybe relieved.  He told me his mom has been texting him and harassing him much more since I showed up at her house.  She complains to him about everything him and I do in her house.  Its a PROBLEM for her.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess you learn to be pan, flat face, and never react or show any emotions after years of serious abuse by your mother, who you are still in the F.O.G. on, and refuse to accept reality.

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, I am done with her.  She will never be my F. MIL, like I had hoped.  I thought I had a new family, turns out I was wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

I  wanted to share my story...WATCH OUT FOR THOSE MIL --- WHO PLOT AND CREATE THEIR OWN DRAMAS.  IT COULD BE A HORROR MOVIE.  THE STUFF NIGHTMARES ARE MADE OUT OF.  I AM 2 STATES OVER DRIVING HOME AS WE SPEAK AND MY HEAD IS STILL SPINNING...AND NO, THIS IS NOT EVERYTHING...THIS IS SOME OF THE MAJOR ISSUES AND POINTS, BUT THERE IS MORE, BELIEVE IT OR NOT.",JUSTNOMIL
"This is about the year between me moving home from college and D(ear)F(iance) and I getting an apartment together, and how it felt like Wreck-It Rose (WIR) tried to make sure we didn't date. *LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG.......* but TL;DR in bold at the bottom.

There's a little bit of backstory that I will explain as quickly as possible. My parents aren't the cleanest people. They're by no means slobs, they keep things very livable, but their house is always cluttered and stuff doesn't get put away as often as it should. That, and they have a dog who is sweet and wonderful, but she thinks she's just as human as I am, has always been allowed on the furniture (she shares the bed with my dad and is a self-trained therapy dog who wakes him up when he stops breathing in his sleep (sleep apnea)), and sheds extra hard when she's stressed out, which is like 40% of the time, and my mom doesn't like to run the vacuum because it stresses the dog out even more, so everything below waist level is covered in black hair always. Because of this and WIR being an obsessive neat freak who taught DF that being messy is unacceptable, I was never comfortable having DF over to my parents' house without a couple days of cleaning *everything*, even though he told me he didn't care. Because of this, I would drive to his house instead and spend the evenings with him.

Now onto the stories. WIR had always been nice to me up until this point. There was that one time she'd called me a whore to my face and she would call DF over and over and over again until he answered her calls when he was staying the weekends with me (there were literally times when we would be eating dinner in a restaurant and I was done with my food before he touched his because she would call and talk his ear off no matter what he was doing, because she doesn't care what he's doing and only cares about herself, but I hadn't connected those dots yet somehow), but otherwise she'd been mostly okay. Those were isolated incidents, or so sweet, naive me told myself. Once I moved home, I didn't want to be around my family (my family **used to be** really JustNo and even the times when they weren't, they're super talkative so I'd never get any time to just be alone with DF) so I'd go to DF's all the time. I was also working with WIR at a family-owned business run by her then-best friend (different story for a different) so we'd sometimes be alone together at work and we always got along. I was essentially part of the family and ate dinner with them every night and helped do things around the house. Things were going great.

I started to notice that if WIR, DF and I were all watching TV together, she would butt in on our conversations. I started talking quieter and quieter until I would have to whisper the conversation to him, and if WIR couldn't make out what I was saying, she'd ask me what I said. Not a big deal, but when I would tell her that I was talking to DF, she'd say, ""Yeah, what'd you say?"" and be very curt about it. We couldn't even have a conversation in another room because she would follow us or hear part of the conversation and yell to butt in. We were invited to two of our best friends' wedding a month after I moved home, and we were talking about how we'd go about going to this wedding and if we were going to stay overnight. She inserted herself into the conversation to tell us we needed to let her know what time we would be home so she could stay up late enough to unlock the door for DF. This wedding was nearly two hours away, we'd be drinking, and several of our friends lived nearby who were willing to let us stay the night. She did her version of CBF (a disgusted scoff and head shake) when we told her we would be staying at our friends' apartment for the night because we'd be drinking and it'd be too late. She then scolded us for daring to drink while we were out. At a wedding. And we were both 23. And our friend we were staying with doesn't drink and she drove us. Then when we were at the wedding she tried calling DF and when he wouldn't answer she blew up his phone, and got pissed at him for calling her when we got back to our friends' apartment because it was too late, even though she left him a voicemail explicitly telling him to call home when we got in, no matter what time it was.

When we were sitting in the living room on the couch (one of those that it's actually two recliners with a console in the middle), I would lean toward DF and hold his hand. One day, DF texted me after I'd gone home for the night to tell me that WIR demanded that I ""stop laying across the middle"" because it was ""smashing the armrest"" and her ""brand new"" couch was getting ruined. 1) I was not laying across the armrest, I was using it for its intended purpose, 2) I checked that armrest the next time I was there and it was as full and in good condition as the other, and 3) those couches were five years old then and she *hated* them. She still has them as hates them even more now. The point was, and I didn't realize this until a lot more recently than I'd like to admit (the FOG is some serious shit, people), that she didn't want us holding hands in her presence.

DF wasn't making very much at the time because his job was technically considered volunteer work, and I had been cut down to barely any hours at my job because another woman who worked there demanded that she work the most hours out of anyone and our boss was shit at handling HR-related drama, so between the two of us we made almost zero money, but we did have enough every once in a while to go on a date. When we would want to go to the local ice cream stand, WIR would make him wait until she gave him money to get his step-dad, FFIL, a quart of their flavor of the week, and would blow up his phone if he didn't come back within 40 minutes. A round-trip was 15 minutes there, 15 minutes back, and the line is usually at least ten minutes long, so we weren't allowed to sit and eat our ice cream together there, we had to order and come right back lest we get numerous phone calls from WIR asking where we were and if we'd gotten FFIL's ice cream. But this was definitely favorable to the other thing that would happen incredibly often, which was that she would make us wait until she asked FFIL if he wanted to go. Whether he did or didn't, those were the times when she would invited herself along without asking us first.

Trips for ice cream weren't the only occasions when she would invite herself along by force. There were more than a couple instances when we had to cancel our movie dates because she would hear that we were going to \[farther away town with more shit to do\], and she would pull her shoes on and tell us she was driving. Because I was still trying to stay on her good side and DF has only recently begun to grow a shiny spine, we would get in her car and shut up. If DF would try to sit in the back with me, WIR would ask him what he was doing and why he wasn't sitting in the front with her, and wouldn't move until he switched seats. We want to eat at this restaurant when we get there? Too bad, WIR wants to eat at the buffet she likes. (Admittedly, I LOVE this buffet too so it wasn't a big deal, but sometimes we'd want to go specifically to have Italian food and she'd pull into the Chinese place without so much as asking us what we wanted to eat.) We almost always had to go to Walmart with her too, and God forbid we walk away from her to go to a different department because she'd call DF and ask him vague questions about what she should get and when he had no idea what she was talking about, would make him go back to wherever she was so she could ask him in person. Of course I had to drop what I was doing too and go with him because I was afraid of her being so lost in her own little world that she would try to leave without me and then get pissed that she had to wait for me. My favorite store is in this town and I would want *so badly* to go there, but she didn't like that store because it wasn't dirt cheap and I was just wasting everyone's time, so we couldn't go, but she would be in Goodwill and Walmart for literally *hours* and we were barely allowed to leave her side.

Because she was always up our asses, DF and I barely had any time together that we could enjoy. This included sexy time. WIR is one of those who likes to go outside and do yardwork, but will be in and out the whole time. She likes to mow the lawn in haphazard circles and then tell somebody else to finish. The neighbors, FFIL's parents, were dairy farmers up until pretty recently, so because FFIL was usually over at the barn helping out, the lawn mowing would fall on DF. You'll (hopefully) never know how horrible it feels to be in the middle of sex for the first time in literally weeks, only to be interrupted by your MIL yelling from outside that DF needs to drop what he was doing to finish mowing. And our communication suffered so badly because of her constant presence, that whenever we *would* have twenty minutes to ourselves, he would turn me down for sex in favor of a conversation.

I was so starved for sex and he was so starved for just a simple fucking conversation where she wasn't butting in, that we didn't even know how to be alone together anymore. Because I was so starved for sex, I didn't want to talk to him. And because he hadn't gotten to actually talk to me boyfriend-to-girlfriend in so long, he didn't feel the intimacy anymore and didn't want to having ""disconnected sex."" But because I was so starved for sex, I didn't care if we connected emotionally or not, I just wanted him physically. This caused *a looooot* of fights. We ended up having one blowout fight a month. Either over normal lack-of-communication-based fights, or  When things were going well between us and we could find enough time where WIR wasn't looking that we could sneak away, I would enjoy the time for all of about ten minutes, and then I'd pull away emotionally. He'd feel like he'd done something wrong and would get depressed because I wasn't telling him what he'd done wrong, and then we'd start fighting. Those were the really depressing fights, the ones where we had gone so long without communicating that we forgot how to tell each other how we were feeling.

We actually did end up breaking up for a while because of it. I insulted an author he likes who I'm not entirely fond of due to a difference in world view, and he felt like if I would insult something he loved then maybe this would be a pattern for the rest of our lives, so after a huge blowout fight, we broke up. Or rather, he ghosted me. Wouldn't answer my calls or texts, wouldn't read my messages on the space of faces, nothing. I was honestly too pissed to care for about three weeks. Then it hit me *hard*. Not because we weren't together, but because he wouldn't even tell me why. The reason I'm including this part of our relationship was that I still worked with WIR. When I saw her at work, she was more... herself, than normal. She carried herself higher, she was more drama oriented, just more *her* than usual. Yet, she didn't say anything about DF. Knowing how she is, if she had anything concrete, or even anything more than an inkling, that we had broken up, she would have brought it up directly. But the only thing that she had as far as ""proof"" of anything, was that I wasn't coming around.

DF and I eventually got back together. He told me that we would start going out more and actually dating each other again and fix our relationship. She'd either get bent out of shape that we were *leeeeeeaving without herrrrrr*, or she would give DF a shopping list.

While we were broken up, DF had two interviews where he works now. He was stressing to me while we were getting back together about the third interview. He got the job, and I got a job in the same town, so we were looking for apartments. I'll get into this more in a separate post, but WIR injected herself into that too, and said a few things that really damaged our relationship, like encouraging DF to make extremely important decisions whether I agreed or not *in front of my face*. Like not even waiting to do it behind my back. She'd pretend I wasn't even there and would tell him to make decisions whether I liked it or went along with it or not. *THAT* is what yanked me out of the FOG like Deadpool being yanked back to consciousness after a dream about dead Vanessa.

**TL;DR:** in my naivety, I believed WIR was okay despite some ""isolated"" incidents. I started spending every night at her house after I moved home from college so I could see DF, and she tried (and briefly succeeded) driving a wedge between us by never letting us have time alone together, and would even tag along on dates or call DF over and over and over again while we were out without her. Then when we were moving in together, she encouraged DF *in front of my fucking face* to make big decisions without my input or consent. I come out of the FOG and have kept my distance from her.

TIDBIT OF INFO I COULDN'T NATURALLY FIT IN TO THE STORY: WIR is one of those moms who not-so-gently reminds you to call her when you get to your destination. She still demands that DF call her when he gets back to our apartment from visiting her. She'll keep him on the phone for twenty minutes after he gets home. During this period of time when I was there every day, she would ask me to call their house or text DF when I got home. I started opting to text a sleeping DF instead of calling their house because as soon as I would let her know I was home she'd say, ""K GOODBYE!"" and hang up. One time I almost hit a runaway horse on my way home. I tried to tell her, and she cut me off like this and hung up on me. That's when I decided to just text DF instead of calling.",JUSTNOMIL
"Be gentle, I'm quite close to losing my shit and moving to Costa Rica. 

So MIL is shit with money. I jokingly have called her Dave Ramsey's worst nightmare. Always spending more than she has, won't even open her mail and just lets bills go to collections, etc. So of course she can't afford a hotel room when she comes to visit for wedding things (but she could afford a Caribbean cruise a month ago... I digress). So she's staying with us.

Here's the rub. My Grandma passed when my mom was pregnant with me, and left me a bit of money in the form of stock shares that have grown over 25 years. With this money, I purchased a house which is large enough to raise a family in. When FH and I get married he will be in the deed as well. 

It's a very lovely home, and also the source of my anxiety. It's much nicer than the home MIL lives in. My parents also live in a nice home and drive recent model cars (all paid for in full as I was raised to do, no shade if you don't but that's how my family always handled our money). MIL calls and asks to borrow money constantly, so I have been dreading this day for four years.

Tomorrow, she finally finds out that we have money. I do not think she'll handle this well. When FH was growing up, she spent money on cars rather than food for him. He bought his own food at the convenience store just so he could eat, and she would yell at him for not sharing with his siblings. So in my mind this woman is out her damn mind to come to us for money as she always does. But she did so even when we were broke (before I found out about my inheritance). So now I fear she'll be full steam ahead trying to get every last cent she can from us because she 'cant get ahead'.

I can handle her asking for money. No is a complete sentence. But what the hell do I say when she asks why my bridal shower is at a country club and why I live in such a nice home compared to the one FH was raised in? How do I respond?

End note: I see peoples financial situations all day long. I do not have, and will never have, anything against poor people. But don't go spending money eating out every night, going on fancy vacations, and maxxing out credit cards, and then say you don't have enough to feed your kids that are still at home. In my book, once you ask me for money, I get to decide if you're responsible enough to get an interest-free loan from me. She isn't. There are plenty of my clients who I would love to help out with financial aid or advice, because they genuinely struggle. MIL makes more than me and still needs a loan because she can't prioritize? Nah son. End rant.

Edit: thanks for the gold! 

But also: again, I have nothing against people who are down on their luck or make a lower income. I help those people for a living. But if you make six figures in a LCOL area, drive new cars, take vacations twice a year, and still make your children hoard food in case you can't feed them, then fuck you and have a nice day. Children shouldn't have to realize at age ten that mommy would rather drive a nice car than feed them.",JUSTNOMIL
"I like to pull this conversation out when people ask why my Dear Husband is NC with his mother. A version of this conversation happened quite a few times between DH and Irrational Irene, but this time it happened between her and I.

Backstory: for many years my husband worked for his dad in the family business making microphone wind screen covers. It was supposed to work like this: FIL would get the order in, DH would make them, FIL sent them out. Things didn't always work that way. He and FIL had so many communication issues it was ridiculous, and FIL wouldn't always tell DH when an order came in. Instead of letting them handle said issues, she would call him and make it 1000x worse.  On this occasion she had called his phone screaming, so he hung up on her. So she called MY phone, and I made the mistake of engaging her. This was the 1st and last time I did that! (forgive my formatting, I'm on mobile)

ME: Hello? 

HER: (screaming incoherently) 

ME: Irene?  I can't understand you. What is happening? 

HER: Do you know what my husband is doing right now?????

ME: Umm..no?

HER: HE IS FILLING AN ORDER!

ME: Did he call DH?

HER: No! He shouldn't have to!

ME: When did this order come in? Cause DH was there all day? He literally just got home like a half hour ago.

HER: 15 mins ago! He should be here doing this, not my husband!

ME:  How is DH supposed to know an order came in if FIL doesn't tell him?

HER: He should just KNOW!

ME: So he should be a mind reader?

HER: He should KNOW an order is coming in! He shouldn't have even left!

ME: But he finished the order he was given. Plus he left at 5pm, how long was he supposed to wait around ""just in case"" an order shows up? And why are you calling? This is between DH and FIL.

HER: HE SHOULD KNOW AN ORDER IS IN WITHOUT BEING TOLD!

ME: Irene, that is ridiculous and you know it. There is no way of knowing an order is in unless FIL communicates this. He can't predict the future. 

HER: YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND! I don't want my husband working on something that is DH's responsibility!

ME: Yes, and I can see why you would be upset IF FIL had told DH and he just didn't show up to do it, but that isn't the case here! DH would have gone back if FIL had TOLD HIM an order was in. Which he didn't do.

HER: But FIL shouldn't HAVE to tell him!

ME: Ok, we are getting nowhere here. This is between FIL and DH, and I'm done with this conversation. 

And that is why she is ""Irrational Irene""!

ETA- I should have said this before, but DH quit working for him once he went NC with his family, so thankfully we don't need to deal with this nonsense anymore!",JUSTNOMIL
"I’m not sure this is the place for this but we’re lost and don’t know where to turn or what to do. 

We’ve been no contact with my husbands family for 7 years for a variety of reasons. Today I received a phone call from a family member of his. Through some searching he did, he eventually was able to obtain our phone number through someone at my husbands work. We found out his mother has about a month to live. She is coherent for now but her death could potentially be painful and traumatic. My husband was able to talk to her. He may visit her. I’m ok supporting him with however he wants to do this. 

The issue is our daughter. She’s 8. She has never met any of his family. She isn’t even really aware of them. The potential for anger and scenes through this process is fairly high with some of his family members. One of the many reasons for the distance we’ve maintained. What do we do here? I’m not overly protective but my gut feeling is not to involve her in any way. My son who is an adult and remembers them has shared the same feelings. 

Has anyone been through something like this? I’m open to advice on how to navigate this. I do wish to return to no contact for myself after this over. I don’t think now is the time to address this though.",JUSTNOMIL
"As a bit of a background, my FMIL can have some serious JN tendencies, shes usually pretty good but sometimes makes remarks that can be hurtful - I have learned to just tell her to fuck off in my head. Weve also spent the last few years working on boundary issues, such as coming over when I am in between nightshifts and cleaning our house, and then complaining about the house being messy when she came over.


About three weeks ago I bought my wedding dress with my mother, bridesmaids and sometimes JNMIL. We took the pictures on my cell phone since I had the best camera, and she asked me to send her one. I did, under the premise that she wouldn't show anyone. 

The dress needs a bit of work, but I am in love with it. It is THE dress, and I'm fine with my closer friends seeing it, but last night while out for dinner FH and I ran into a friend of hers that I've never met. I guess she invited to the wedding and asked how the planning was going, I'd mentioned that I'd picked out my dress. 

She said she had seen it. A complete stranger. Had seen me in my dress. Maybe I'm overreacting but I feel violated, it's not ready, and I wanted it to be a surprise. JNMIL knew that, and if this lady has seen it I'm sure many others have. I feel sick to my stomach and I feel like the surprise is ruined and the dress is tainted.

I need help writing a message that will a) get her to remember I'd told her I didnt want the dress to be seen and b) make her feel guilty as fuck for showing it off.

Side note. Her friend told her that she had seen us out for dinner, so she texted FH that we should be saving money and not eating out because he needs to get healthy and lose weight... this was our first time out in two months, one meal ain't gunna wreck it all honey.",JUSTNOMIL
"This week I had a hospital appointment. For the past seven years I have been gradually losing my vision. I’ve lost depth perception, there are holes in my visual field so I regularly don’t see moving objects, my vision is constantly blurred or double and I often have to close one eye to just use my left eye as my right is too weak to focus. I’ve had issues with my eyes all my life, I was born with a slight squint but it’s got worse as I grew older and I’ve always been very self conscious about it. I don’t look at the camera in photos to try and avoid looking cross eyed on film, I don’t like how I look and it’s always bothered me. 


The doctors have tried all sorts of things over the past few years- constant tests, scans, more scans, more consultants, no one knew what was going on. They checked for brain tumours, degradation of the optic nerves, infection and every thing came up negative. Without a diagnosis they couldn’t do treatment so for seven years I’ve been in limbo, not knowing if I was going blind but unable to see properly. 


So this week I had another appointment and this time they had some news. There is no damage to my eyes at all, they should have 20/20 vision. There is no neurological condition which caused this. It’s exclusively because Drama Queen and my enabler father didn’t follow the doctors orders from when I was four to use eye patches and glasses and other simple things to correct my squint. Because Drama Queen never did any of the treatment. She told the optician she did but then never followed through. The doctor had wanted to do surgery when I was a child to correct the issue and Drama Queen refused- “oh it’s only cosmetic, who cares about that?”


I remember hearing her say that and feeling angry and betrayed because I FUCKING CARED! I cared about being teased and I cared about doing what the doctor said and I wanted the operation but my mother refused it because she couldn’t be bothered with me. 


This week I got told that because Drama Queen never did the treatment my eye muscles became under formed and created a permanent squint and visual issues as my brain tried to compensate for the deficiency. Because of her neglect I nearly lost my eye sight. The doctor thinks that they can still do surgery to correct the problem- physically tightening my eye muscles so hopefully it will stop the squint and also fix the visual issues partly. It’s hard to do on an adult but I’ve been referred to a surgeon so I’m now waiting to see what he says. 


The doctor was telling me all this and she looked disgusted, she said that my mother was totally wrong for not doing anything to help me. Drama Queen did none of the treatment but told the doctors she did. 


Then the doctor brings out a scan, one of the ones of my brain, and points to these little tiny circle type things on the scan. Apparently they are healed haematoma from when I was a child. Most likely caused by being shaken. 


Drama Queen’s favourite punishment for me was grabbing me and shaking me as a child. She did it until I was in my teens. Apparently it’s not just babies who shouldn’t be shaken. The doctor didn’t say anything but she pointed out the circles and explained what they were- the scans get forwarded to my GP so this doctor wanted me to know what she was sending and her analysis. I felt really...just empty and tired. Not even surprised any more. 


Drama Queen never did anything to really help me. She didn’t follow simple doctors orders but lied that she did. She gaslit me about the severity of any illness and said I was faking or not sick at all or the doctor was wrong and I believed her because she was my mother. She’d make a fuss about all sorts of things but never took steps to make them better. She’d ignore so much and let me suffer. She didn’t care about my self esteem or my image, she didn’t care about me full stop. 


When it was obvious I needed mental health treatment she persuaded me I didn’t and kept me away from doctors. She never allowed me to speak to therapists and she always made sure to be present at any appointment. She always told people I was a fantasist and ‘had an over active imagination’. She never got me help. She never supported me when I was suicidal, she never got involved or even noticed most things. 


She never taught me to look after myself, not even how to brush or take care of my hair. I’m only just learning now and I’m 34. I never looked good as a child, I was a mess and my teachers always got at me because my hair was a mess and I didn’t know how to look after it. Their looks of pity and derision were hard to bare, I just wanted to feel kind of pretty or at least be like the other girls whose mothers cared about their presentation. 


Now I’m realising that she cared so little that I’ve been slowly losing my eye sight because she couldn’t be bothered to do what the doctor said to do when I was four. My father enabled her and also did nothing. She was more important to him than I was and so he never told her no or did any of the doctors stuff. 


I’m not angry, not really, It just feels like the normal status quo for my family. It’s what I expect from her. I sometimes wonder what would have happened if I had loving parents and I can’t imagine it. I’m not surprised by what I learned this week. It’s normal for Drama Queen. 


I’m so fucking tired of having a mother who didn’t love me. That’s my main emotion when I think about her now: feeling tired. Is it so fucking hard to make your kid wear glasses or follow doctors orders or just do surgery that she didn’t even have to pay for? Is it so difficult to be  vaguely responsible? Is it that damn hard? Fucking stray dogs look after their puppies better than she looked after me! Ugh. 


Just wanted to vent a bit, not expecting any advice but go ahead if there is anything you want to say! I’m just so disgusted by how little interest my parents took in me and it’s sheer laziness and neglect. Some things I can over look but other things there is no excuse for.",JUSTNOMIL
"So it's been a minute since I posted. But all heck broke loose yesterday and everything is finally out in the open about my mil, blind idiot. 



I broke down and told my extremely darling husband everything.  About her calling me a gold digging whore, about her screaming at me to shut up, about her getting drunk at a party and telling everyone I was a gold digger etc. Etc. Etc. If it happened he heard about it. 


His response? It's okay, it's not my fault and he is sorry I didn't tell him sooner. He said it was never my burden  to bear alone. He then said he was so touched that even though she had been awful to me that I still did things with his family. 



He then went to her and told her off. Told her she is never allowed to call us of she's been drinking. If she drinks and we are at her house we are leaving and she better make this right with me because OP had done nothing wrong. 



She said she said it,  BUT didn't mean it the way it sounded.  She was trying to warn me other thought those things.  Hubby asked me if I believed her. I told him truthfully I dont give a flying elephant what her intentions were. I dont care if she shouts it from the roof top. Knowing he knows , that he believes me makes it all okay for me.

Now, I have seen JNMIL And JNFIL three times since then.

"For the past few years, JNMom has bought SO jeans and a shirt for Christmas. He was in a financial pickle so it did help him at the time.

Background context: SO and I live with my parents and mentally ill older brother. My mom buys all my brother's clothes, including underwear. She loves playing the mom role, despite the fact that we are all grown ass adults.

She's offered to take SO's clothes to the laundromat, and fold his clothes for him (he works a hectic job) so he was very grateful. She made a comment about how he doesn't have a lot of underwear and needs some more.

Yesterday, I'm in my room and we're talking and suddenly tells me in a cheery tone:

""I was at Macy's earlier and saw that Calvin Kleins cost $38. They also had Tommy Hilfiger. What's his size - medium - again? I want to buy them for his birthday!""

SO's birthday is in September. She literally went to Macy's to peek at the prices.

I asked her (trying to greyrock), ""That's really expensive."" She replies, ""I'd put it on my Macy's credit card!""

Keep in mind my mom is early 70s and retired (and complains how she has no money) but she's willing to spend almost $40 on boxer briefs.

I told SO this and he was horrified, as was my (usually) JYDad.

I want to call her out that this is so inappropriate but I know she'd get defensive and pouty and accuss me of being perverted and misjudging her good intentions blah blah blah. How can I bring this up?

Thanks all as always!

"We have been mostly successful at NC with Mother Smearest for... maybe 10 months since her past manipulative shenanigans.  My marriage is becoming more solid, we are sleeping better, and man does life feel alive and joyful since not needing to deal with the walking scowl.

DH is still connected to her on facebook unfortunately, along with about 100 extended family.  We are in an entirely different state from his home state, so many of them have heard her smear campaign.  Some she hasn't yet reached, however.  We have plans to spend more time with people who haven't crossed over into FM land as we try to stop the bleeding, but let me explain the current issue.

We have been going on trips.  Happy trips that feed our soul.  We feel like those poor beagles that have been lab animals all their lives and touch grass for the first time.  We feel so... free.  Part of dealing with the smear campaign has been getting the hell on with our lives and being our happy selves.  So we post these photos of good days... for ourselves and also so that other family can scratch their head and ask wtf!?!?  when I don't look insane, unstable, depressed, or whatever type of villain she was telling people I was.  It has been successful... a few people we thought we had lost have reached out.  

Today however, on our last trip to the mountains, under smiling, fun photos of us and her grandchild, she posted a sad face emoji.  For all to see. 

And I'm livid.  DH won't block her entirely bc she unfortunately is still involved in business dealings with her.   I want to put her on blast.  I just don't know how.  I don't want her to control or tarnish this symbol of happiness (which is the exact reason she posted.)  I hate that other folks who weren't reached have now been exposed thanks to facebook algorithms.

nipulative to the point that he had no self worth till he moved

"Obviously I haven't been able to go NC as of yet (soon. Soon my pretties!) And I'm feeling particularly snarky. This is a golden opportunity to Troll the absolute shiznit out of her.


She texted me again last night (first time since I told her I'm not showing yet. She never bothered saying a single word to me after learning that. So she changed tactics) at literally a minute after midnight...which is SUPER weird for her. She's an early bird. She always goes to bed by like 9:30PM bc she's falling asleep sitting up by that time of night. And she usually wakes up around 4AM (bc she was raised a farm girl and has been waking up that early for as long as she can remember. Had to milk the cows before school dontcha know!) So her texting at midnight made me wonder if I'd somehow stepped into a parallel universe or the twilight zone or some shit like that. 


What she said seems innocuous enough to anyone else...here I'll just copy the text as is.
TROC: Just wanted you to know that I'm thinking about you and my grandbaby.  Love you.  What names have you guys been thinking of?



Here's the other weird thing, DH and I had literally just been talking to my dad/DH's FIL a couple of days prior and my dad asked us what names we were considering? I laughed and admitted that DH and I had yet to actually (seriously) discuss names as of yet cuz every time we talk we've had more pressing issues to discuss and settle. I have a list of names I like but my dad laughed and said never mind, we've got time to figure it out and it's entirely our decision to make. (In other words, he knows how to back off graciously. He's excited and he's not an ass) 


DH and actually had a more serious discussion about Boys names we like (basically since he picked the middle name I've been making a list of potential first names and basically throwing them at him a few at a time like throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks. ) up till now all the names he's suggested have been so ludicrous they're obviously jokes and he's vetoed plenty of names I like because they sound like names for...boys who aren't whiter than white. 😂 (my DH is so pale and ginger that he looks like a matchstick and glows in the dark too lol. And I'm not much darker than him honestly. Our kid is gonna be as white as milk) 

Anyway, we've narrowed it down to about 3 or 4 potential names we both like and one is atm our top pick. YAY! 


But we're not telling TROC or really anyone besides maybe my dad (the man knows how to keep it to himself and he and my Stepmom live on the other side of the country anyway. TROC can't do Jack shit to get info from my dad. Definitely no FM over there lol) 

Now I wanna Troll her hard. I mean the most offensive, and evil names we can find for a boy and a girl. She's holier than thou kind of religious (and while SUPER ANTI HARRY POTTER the only character name she'd associate with HP would be Harry Potter.) 

So far DH and I have only been able to come up with the following for trolling baby names:

Boys- Lucifer and Beelzebub 

Girls- Jezebel and Lilith 

Idk I want a better selection of wicked names to horrify her with lol. This is just to good to pass up!

"Tis I, the frenchiest fry here to talk to you all about my latest escapades with Disease Louise, my jnmom who only seems to like me when I'm sick, also she likes to do fucked up things to you in the name of medicine. For further background bitchbot has your back.


So my last few posts here have kind of revolved around this situation where  DL is a FM for my GC younger brother because of some messed up stuff he said at her birthday party. You can read about the last developments from my post in r/justnofamily [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/beucf4/gc_brother_is_butthurt_that_i_cut_him_off_turned/) and my last interaction with Disease Louise about the situation [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/bkse1i/disease_louise_and_all_kinds_of_justno_gems/)

I had kind of hoped that after my last conversation with Disease Louise about my GC brother we wouldn't have to talk about this again. Obvs I thought wrong because DL is still SUPER upset about the fact that I refuse to talk to him and called to ~~guilt~~ appeal to my better nature to make me resume contact.


Initially she had called to set up a camping trip for this last weekend (which I will talk about later) and made a comment about how she hopes everyone gets along on the trip. Knowing Disease Louise like I do I know that this is supposed to be a criticism of the fact I'm not talking to her favorite son so I don't even blink and reply ""well as long as GC brother isn't there we should all have a good time."" this was not what she wanted to hear so she started in on all the reasons why I should forgive him (the usual but he's ffaaaaaaaaaaaaaamily!) but after all that she said something that honestly just got my goat. She said ""You know he didn't mean what he said and besides I talked to him when you left the room and he said that he was joking, that you just took it out of context so just let it go already! And anyways I talked to him about it and told him it was out of line""

Ya'll.

I saw RED. 


I reminded her that HE started a political debate about healthcare at the dinner table. That HE told me I knew nothing about what a pregnant woman would need as far as care because I had never been pregnant and THEN he said what he said. I asked what I had taken out of context, how this chain of events could possibly lead to me  being confused about what he said to me. She didn't have a response and just sat silently on the other end of the phone. I told her that furthermore just because his mommy talked to him doesn't make any of this ok and that I will forgive him if/when I am ready to, that I will never fully forgive him but with time I *may* start speaking to him again. 


I also brought up the point that it would have probably had a bigger impact if she had stood up for me immediately after he said what he did rather than waiting until I left the room. I don't care that he was drunk, hurting, confused, whatever there are somethings you should never fucking say and this was one of them. She agreed with me that it would have probably been better and we went back to discussing our camping plans.


The camping trip was actually a lot of fun, GC brother had to work and couldn't ~~crash~~ join us so it was just me, DH, Disease Louise, and my two other younger brothers. We did all the camping tropes as it was my DH very first camping trip so we kept it pretty basic but it really was a blast. My DH now wants to go camping every weekend lol. For the most part DL was very well behaved, she only made a couple of BEC comments about my cooking (I was cooking on a grate directly over a camp fire) and how she could do it better and did I know she once cooked on a rock??? (She did, she built a little fire pit and used a big rock to cook burgers at a lake once and I'll admit that was pretty cool). 

The other thing was pictures. I was taking tons of them as this was my DH first trip and I wanted to make sure I had plenty to remember it by but of course Disease Louise has to try to horn in. See DL has this thing where she takes pictures of me so that I am looking my worst so that she can post them to her faceyspace. Even if she takes some that look good she will deliberately choose bad pictures of me to post. DH and I assume it's because I'm like a carbon copy of her but younger and she wants to make it look like she is more attractive than me. This didn't really start up until she was single again so I'm inclined to believe it. 

Anyways, she kept trying to take (terrible) candid pictures of me making breakfast the next morning but luckily her phone was too far away from her that I wouldn't have noticed her going to get it so she took some on my phone and tried to send them to herself. Well she would have had to unlock my phone to actually send them and didn't have the password to get in and got caught so she was unable to get her hands on those seriously bad pictures of me.",JUSTNOMIL

Okay, I torched my two other posts, and I hate to be that person that's all ""may delete later, idk,"" but I am terrified of this getting to someone in my family. This is VERY LONG. Sorry.

We lost a very dear (like a brother to me) relative on Memorial Day. A few days later, 30+ people in my family get together for another nephew's birthday. No one called or texted me that they were meeting, I saw pics on the Faceplace and messaged my younger sister. Incredibly long, messy story later-ys &amp; I are...okay. We had a text message based semi-argument, and as soon as I blocked her on everything, she called my house. Hubs told me not to answer, but I did, and the call was, I think, productive. I let everything out. Absolutely everything, and she got it. At least, I think she did. We're in 'trust but verify' territory at the moment.

Older sis-I check in on her. Her kid just died. I'm just glad she's getting out of bed every day. No issues there.

Mom-good gravy where to start? (She needs a name) Ok, the relative that died was her GC grandkid. Her first, so I kind of get it a little bit, except: my kid-she would bail on his birthday parties when he was little, or come &amp; leave early because the church missions conference was going on, and they couldn't possibly miss one night or even be late to that. This year, she didn't even call him on his birthday. The next day, she send a message on the Faceplace (which he is NEVER on. He's 19-the faces is for old people now). She has his cell. She has our home # (yeah, we still have one for some reason). Nothing. Every time I have tried telling her I feel left out of something, it's always unintentional.Used to, I'd get a call when everyone was some place, and they would ask why I wasn't there, and I always said, ""No one told me."" Eventually, even those calls stopped.

Now, I get it here a little, because the church they attend I no longer attend for reasons (mostly doctrinal/theological issues I'm not getting into here but think difference between Roman Catholic/Protestant--that's not it, but you get that they are diametrically opposed on a lot of issues), and in part because when hub's grandmother died, he asked me to cook Thanksgiving &amp; Christmas dinners for the family. His family is super small, and I was actually the next in line, so I've been (WILLINGLY) doing that so my FIL will have some place to go on holidays. I see my family on Christmas Eve. So they don't see me as much as everyone else.

What hurts is that I never really occur to anybody (out of sight, out of mind, maybe?). When I said in what I think was a gentle way to my mom, who I understand is grieving--and so am I--I get her usual, ""if I'm not right, then I'm the victim"" reply.I'm not savvy enough to edit &amp; include links, but basically the exchange was:Text Exchange:

Mom: (Intro message explaining why she doesn't have something unimportant-no one is upset that we don't have the stuff, and never will be) into:  ""This grief is almost more than I can bear. No one knows the pain of losing a child or grandchildren until it happens to them...please keep praying for (family and myself) as this load is heavy. Wish you could have been at church with us yesterday.      \*\*Note the party was also yesterday after church.

Me: Don't worry about my stuff. Coworker won't care to wait. I'm praying for everyone. I'm not going to lie: it hurt a lot more than I want to go into that not one person yesterday bothered to text me about family member's party, but I'll get over it. I always do. Love you. \*\*Passive aggressive? A little, but I was, and still am hurt.

Mom: Honey we were just trying to make it through another day. If we don't reach out to you it's not by design.I know (OP) that just another attack of Satan please try to understand the pain. I know you can't and I pray you never do. We would never deliberately hurt or ignore you, I was simply trying to focus on (family member. Birthday party wasn't planned (Older sis) was waiting to see what he wanted so all the family was at church and they were told at that time. All went out of respect for (deceased) and (family member).

Me: I'm at work, and it's not a good time to go into this, but it happens way more than just now, so I don't think it's fair to give the devil all the credit. Just know that I love you, but I'm grieving, too, and being excluded again hit me a lot harder than it usually does.

Mom: OP, I prefer to press on. My home my door is always open to you. I'm not debating anything about you being left out I never leave you out on purpose.I poured my life into you as a child, love you with a mother's heart, beg you to come to church. I'm not sure I know what else to do. Always here when you seem to want me.

Me: I'm not debating, I'm telling you how I feel. How I've felt a lot of times, and it's always dismissed. Like it's being dismissed now. I'm allowed to have feelings, and it isn't fair to pretend that I don't. That last sentence was spiteful, mean, and untrue. And you said it to hurt me, and I'm not okay with that.

Mom: I'm sorry you feel that way about me OP. I do not do spiteful things especially to my kids, but if you have to feel that way, it's your choice.

I did not respond. The next day I get this:

Mom: OP please come to church with us on Sunday. I'm sorry I don't make you feel loved or appreciated enough. Yes your feelings count they always have.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are: 1) Am I an asshole for even telling her I was hurt? 2) Should I let this go because I \*know\* she's hurting right now? 3) Am I wrong for seeing SO MUCH JN in her replies? 4) How do I respond, or should I even bother? (I cannot for reasons of conscience sit in that church-these are huge, theological issues for me, and being there feels like condoning heresy to me. My faith is important to me, and I feel like a hypocrite when I'm there. So I'm looking for a diplomatic way of shutting that down (if at all possible) because that's a compromise I can't make.)

The issue isn't WHY it happens. The issue is, and always been THAT it happened. Seriously, I don't rate 30 seconds of ""Hey meet us at \_\_\_\_ for a party.""",JUSTNOMIL
"First order of business is that there are no updates as of now. HGT has been honestly pretty okay to us and BIL/BILBF so far, just some occasional BEC things that annoy me because it’s her being herself, but not worth a post. 

So DH told me last night that HGT and BIL want to go to famous mouse-related theme park right after Christmas. I’m super excited because I’ve never been and have always wanted to. Now, in light of HGT’s recent bout of decent human behavior, I’m not too concerned about going. However, I don’t completely trust her not to lose her shit between now and then as she has been known to do leading up to big events when she suddenly remembers BIL is gay and very much in love with his BF and actually has to face that fact. 

What boundaries, rules, etc. can I/DH set for this trip to ensure that we all have a nice time and keep her in check? She’s also offering to help us pay for airfare as part of a Christmas gift and college graduation gift for DH if that makes a difference. I’m okay with that so long as she doesn’t use it to put us in the middle of any potential beef with BILBF.",JUSTNOMIL
"TW - pregnancy loss, very heated remarks regarding abortion

Hello all of you beautiful people. I’m so sorry that I haven’t been updating here, so much has happened. So buckle up, this is a long ride.

I DID manage to get a restraining order against the Hamburglar, with the help of CPS. Over the course of the last couple months, original CPS lady lost her job too, as we weren’t the first time she had abused her power and Hamburglar ended up losing her mind in a *spectactular* way. 

***Pregnancy loss details in this paragraph***
My pregnancy was a bit of a rollercoaster. At my first US, for those who don’t remember, they thought I had a blighted ovum. I went back a week later to see a healthy fetus with a good, strong heartbeat, but a small spot that looked like it might be a subdural hemorrhage. Scheduled another US a week after that, went by myself while my husband was out of state for work, and found that the hemorrhage had grown from less than half the size of the babe to more than half of my uterus and there was no longer a heartbeat. DH drives a truck, so it was impossible to even get in touch with him that day until he got off work. Due to the size of the hemorrhage and the fact that I hadn’t had any bleeding, I was going to have to have a D&amp;C to prevent sepsis and I didn’t want to schedule anything without DH there with me.

So. I left the OB and called my dad, in a moment of weakness I STILL regret, months later. My dad was an angel, immediately supportive and offered to come get the kids and watch them for as long as we needed. Thankfully I turned him down, as the kids were still with my mom since I had been put on bed rest up until this appointment. I told him everything that had happened, including my current condition and the impending procedure, and the fact that I couldn’t talk to DH until he got off work so I was basically dealing with this alone. He told me to come out to their house and I told him point-blank that the last person I wanted to deal with right then was Hamburglar, and he said he understood and dropped it.

So of COURSE he told Hamburglar what was going on. And of COURSE she proceeds to blow up DH’s phone FOR SIX HOURS. So when he gets off work, instead of immediately calling me as he would have, he called her first because he was afraid someone had died, he had HUNDREDS of missed calls from her. She answers the phone by screeching about how I’m a murderer, I went off while he was gone to get an abortion. Apparently I had been planning this for weeks???? Anyway. He knew she was full of shit and hung up on her, then called me. So I didn’t even get to tell him in my own way, I had to explain that Hamburglar was a fucking bitch and how she had come to that wildly different conclusion. I called my dad to tell him what she did, and as far as I know he was PISSED and promised we wouldn’t be hearing from her again.

I ended up getting the procedure scheduled for a week after the US, and luckily got the cameras we were gifted set up before then, because we came home afterwards to a completely destroyed home. The crazy bitch busted through our window with a golf club (that she would have had to buy for this express purpose, because neither of them golf) and let herself in, then proceeded to destroy everything we own. She destroyed our TV, our Xbox, took a knife to our mattresses (including the kids’) and our brand new couch. She piled every piece of clothing she could find in the  house, ours and the kids, in the middle of the living room and covered them in bleach, gallons and gallons. She smashed every breakable thing she could find with the golf club, including the toilet, our dishes, every window in the house, everything. She shoved our AC unit out the window onto the ground, destroying it. She didn’t touch the food though?? So I guess the “don’t mess with your grandkids’ food” lesson set in but that was it?

We got home to Hamburglar sprawled in the front yard, golf club in one hand and MY bottle of wine in the other, absolutely plastered, screaming about how I’m a “murdering bitch who hates children, trying to keep my baaaaabiiiieeees from me”. We’re also those weird people that collect liquor in weird/interesting bottles, and every.single.one. was smashed in the yard around her. I’m not sure how many she tried to drink and how many she just broke, because she would have died if she had drank them all, but she had clearly drank PLENTY. She didn’t even get up out of the grass to actually engage us, just laid there and yelled, I guess trying to make sure the whole neighborhood knew how awful I was? So DH calls the cops while I sit there and listen to her screech about how I’m going to hell, I murdered my child because I can’t handle the responsibility of being a parent, I’m a baby-killer, I should have just died instead because she would have raised my baby, ad nauseam. She was honestly just repeating the exact same things over and over and over. Meanwhile, I just had a D&amp;C for a miscarriage *maybe* an hour ago. I’m dealing with the pain of losing a very much *wanted* pregnancy and she’s here spewing her pro-life bullshit at me.

After about 20 minutes of this, the cops show up. DH finally goes inside with one officer while the other stays outside with Hamburglar and me, and actually sees the extent of the damage. Meanwhile, the cop outside listens to Hamburglar for a few minutes, then turns to me and says, “Are you sure you want to press charges? I mean, I can get her for drunk and disorderly, but there’s no proof she actually did anything.”

“Well all of my windows are smashed, she’s holding a golf club, and that’s my bottle collection in pieces around her, soooo....”

“Well that’s all circumstantial. There’s no proof of anything...”

Let me tell y’all something real quick. I live in the Bible Belt. It took me all of .5 seconds to figure out what was going on here - this cop had listened to her abortion rant, decided she was justified, and was taking her side. Just wait.

“Isn’t that what a lawyer’s for? We have a restraining order.”

“You have a restraining order.”

“Yes. Because she broke into our house and stole all of our food, and then tried to run me over with her car. While I was pregnant.”

I swear this cop LAUGHED in my face. “Okay well, you’re not pregnant now.”

Guys. If DH and the other cop hadn’t come back outside right then I would have been the one in jail. I had enough time to scream “I had a fucking miscarriage!” before DH was back next to me and moving me away. The other cop quickly shut the first one down and said they were taking Hamburglar immediately. He said it was the worst break in he had ever seen in terms of damage. He actually called the first cop an idiot because Hamburglar wasn’t in cuffs when he came back out and shut down the “it might be circumstantial” crap he was trying to spew. I guess some cops take restraining orders seriously? 🤷‍♀️ I gave my statement, had my mom come pick me up, and DH dealt with the rest of the cop stuff.

My dad finally seemed to come to his senses and refused to bail Hamburglar out (the next day, when she had sobered up enough to call him). Him and several of his friends helped DH clean out all of our stuff, replaced the broken windows (with windows that were a bit more smash-resistant than the ancient windows we had before) and toilet, and financed new furniture to replace the stuff she ruined. He wasn’t able to make us completely whole, but it’s a start and we’re working on rebuilding.

Of course Hamburglar tried to plead not guilty and had to go to trial. We gave our lawyer (that my dad paid for) the recordings we had of her smashing our window, reaching through to unlock the door, and destroying our living room. It didn’t get *everything* but it was more than enough, so when she tried to say she showed up drunk because she was so distraught over “what I’d done” and found my house like that she looked stupid af.


Now let’s fast-forward to this morning. Hamburglar was released on parole (I think? I’m not 100% the difference in parole and probation) on Monday. (So not actually 24 hours, but close enough) I have the kids in daycare because I go back to work in a week, so I left my house at 8 this morning to drive them to daycare and then went back home. About 45 seconds after I lock the door behind me Hamburglar pulls up in my driveway and gets out. So, obviously she was watching for me to get home. She comes up to the door and starts knocking and calling through the door about how she just wants to talk, there’s obviously been a bunch of misunderstandings between us, she wants to fix things, yadayadayada. Well, conditions of her release included she was not allowed to contact me or my family in any way, so I called the cops again, who were very prompt in showing up this time. I watched through my brand new window as three cop cars surrounded my house within 4 minutes of me calling and Hamburglar was cuffed and thrown into the back of a car. When I opened my door to give my statement they were MUCH nicer, and Hamburglar had switched back to screaming obscenities at me from the back of the cop car. I called my lawyer, who seemed thoroughly unsurprised, and he promised to call me as soon as he figures out what’s going on (when she gets rebooked and everything).

So. That’s all done, and I’m sitting at a Starbucks down the street using the WiFi because I suddenly feel unsafe in my home again, even though I’m pretty much sure she’s back in jail. I’m sorry for the novel, but this has been a hell of a rollercoaster and I needed to get it out. I haven’t even called my dad yet, I’m waiting until I have something to say besides “get your she-demon on a leash”.

Ugh.",JUSTNOMIL
"Back with an update on Margot (JNmom) and her work situation. Tell me what you think!

Margot has been in contact with me over the past few days, and each time we talk, she mentions how she hates her job and refused to go into work for the past week because “her boss is out to get her.” Today, she told me she put in her 2 weeks. Ugh, so irritating! 

Margot goes on to tell me how my JNSM is supportive of this decision, and even encouraged Margot’s doctor to say she can’t work! Yes, you read that right. JNStepMother has encouraged Margot’s doctor to say Margot cannot work due to her bipolar 2 disorder. He even gave Margot a letter saying so. All of this just to get on disability. 

Margot hasn’t been able to keep a job for years now, each time blaming her disorder. She mentions how it affects her work too much, but also uses excuses such as the one I mentioned above. Over the past two years, she has said (every time she is about to quit or get fired) that her boss is out to get her. She says how her bosses treat her differently than her coworkers for doing the same work, or how they threaten her with her job constantly. All of the excuses she uses for not wanting to work. Truth of the matter is, Margot has a mouth on her and doesn’t know when to shut it. She can’t get along with anyone who doesn’t believe in her beliefs. 

I let Margot know I was concerned for her health, because sitting at home all day (sleeping, in her case) is not going to help her disorder and only cause her depression to get worse. She doesn’t seem to be listening. I asked if it would be possible for her to have medication switched because the ones she is on clearly are not working. She says the doctor just recently switched her medication to see if it would help. 

The most frustrating part of it all is this: she is complaining about not being able to work/find a job!! WHAT DO YOU MEAN?! She has left over 10 jobs in the past two years (I had to start keeping count, it’s that much), and each time using the same excuses and connecting all of it with her disorder. 

I let her know that if she were to go on disability, she won’t be able to work as often as she is right now, if at all. She says how she doesn’t have a choice but to work, because she can’t be cooped up in the house all day. 

???????

Does this sound just a stupid to anyone else as it does to me? She has complained and left every job she has had, blames her disorder and other people for her choices. Wants to get on disability so she doesn’t have to worry about working, but still wants to work? I’m at a loss of words.",JUSTNOMIL
"I never really thought this far ahead. I sent the very harshly worded letter outlining the injustices against me, with really firm boundaries laid out. I got a email saying they would accept them basically and apologizing. (probly fake)

Now what? I feel too awkward about my letter to face them, but at the same time, i'm sure once my daughter is born they will eventually want to meet her and thats something I want too.

But I just don't know how to move forward. My brother sent my dad a boundary letter years ago and my dad FLIPPED at the word boundaries and was so insulted and hurt, and blamed it on his wife. 

I made it clear in my letter it was all me. I don't think there was any room to blame anyone but themselves with how clear the letter was.

I am just confused. Part of me wants to just crawl in a hole and never talk to them again but the other part knows i need to be able to face them with strength, strength that was easy to have in writing but not as easy in practice.

What should I do? Leave them blocked, and communicate through email, eventually unblock them...email them back? it was left that I would contact them when I was ready.",JUSTNOMIL
"First time poster, long time lurker, so Hi. I think this might be the start of a loooong serie of post in the next few month.

**TLDR** My mother decided to spoil a joyful event (new little baby niece!) with here nasty jealousy about my ILs, guilt trips, and victimisation. I stood as firmly as I could, but it's the first time for me, but it triggered a massive anxiety attack this morning.

**Little bit of background :** I(27f) have been with my SO(28m) for 7year now. I love my ILs, and have an amazing relationship with MIL. She lives in our city, she is always here to help but still very respectful of our privacy, and she confide in me a lot when she struggle herself (with her own justNoMother mostly). My mother on the other hand is a big bag of justNo. It took time to figure out that her behavior was not okay, but now that I can see how caring, living and motherly MIL can be... Obviously, my mother noticed and is massively jealous.

**So, to the story now**:

SO and I try to spend time with everyone on each side of the family, but the last 2 months have been hectic. So last time (mid april) my mother asked if we were free any sunday to come visit them, I told her that we were 150% busy until june. SIL (brother's wife) is pregnant and due date was for mid june, so we agreed to see each other when we go meet the baby. Brother live on the other side of the country so it made sense to gather there and see everyone.

This morning, big family announcement, yesterday my brother and his wife had their 2nd child! I was thrilled of course, and started to make plans with my mother by text, as we agreed. Here is a quick translation and summary of the conversation:

Me: *""we can meet at the hospital on monday. We can't on sunday, surprise bday party for SIL (SO's sister)""* 
Mom: *""Okay i must go now... bye kiss.""* and than a minute later *""we had planned to meet this week end, but hey, SIL bday is more important i guess.""*. I mean, what the crap??

She insisted a few times, she was sure that we agreed on this date for dinner at their home on sunday, and that I *""must have forgotten because it was sooo long ago""*. Even after I sent her screenshots of the conversation (and we talk only via messages now, yay boundaries, I have proof thanks to that), where we agreed on meeting at the hospital to see Baby.

This was all at 6am as I was getting prepared to go to work, so at this point I was starting to panic because I know she is pissed for whatever reason she has to justify her reasonning, and she was going to spam me via text messages all day long. So I offered her an olive branch and told her that they could come for afternoon tea saturday as we are halfway to Brother's place.

&amp;#x200B;

Mom: 
*""we wont.""* 
*""so much for that.""* 
*""we take life as it comes.""* 
*""bye.""* 
*""goodbye, and at worst, at the end of July.""* 
and 10min later of me not responding, 
*""sorry, but lot of worries, not in happy mood right now, ""everything is fine"".""* 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I was out of the tramway to go to work, and I was shaking, hardly breathing and started to feel the burst arriving, so I just sat in a corner of the tram station and waited for my colleague that I knew would arrive a few minutes later. I arrived an hour late at work.

Once ""calmed down"" I send screenshots of the conversation to SO. He thinks that my mother is toxic for me and we should go NC. Because each and every time we see or talk to each other, it tears me appart. I just can't anymore with her. I think of going VVVVLC for now. I don't even know where to start, I am just so tired. I would really like some insight and advices.

"I’m 23M and have Autism Spectrum Disorder (Asperger Syndrome), anxiety, depression and PTSD, all of which occasionally inhibit my ability to take care of myself and make it only natural to lose patience with me sometimes. Also, I apologise if this goes long but I’m still trying to cope with all this.

A bit of background. I spent Christmas 2017 with my stepmother, her and my dad having just had a messy divorce. The thing she said to me that really started a dialogue was “how did he cheat on me after what your mother did to him?” Basically, after my autism diagnosis, my mother coped by sleeping around behind my dad’s back and ended up getting fired for showing up to work drunk. I remember waking up in different men’s houses while my parents were still together, and I have a vague memory of something else my stepmum told me, that my mum and some guy had taped over one of my VHS’s with a sex tape. A thing I do remember vividly is when she told me her welfare would stop and she’d die if I lived with my dad (as per my own wishes) and then me grovelling to my dad not to kill my mum because I was 6, had autism and didn’t know better. Some members of my family deny all this but others have quietly corroborated the parts I don’t remember because this happened when I was 5-6 years old.

After remembering some of the key parts- and also putting two and two together that my trauma comes from being placed into a boarding school where I was mercilessly bullied solely because my mother couldn’t be arsed taking advantage of her full custody- I came home for a day, did not speak to my mother, and returned to university, locking her out of all contact. I did not speak to her or my 12 year old half brother (who I love dearly) for 5 months. It was then that my trauma related hallucinations started, and I ended a long-distance relationship where I was manipulated and cheated on, which led to me having a mental health crisis and dropping out of university. To my mother, who’d felt the need to have some control of my romantic and online interactions well into my 20’s, this validated everything. I ended up moving back in with her as a necessity. The first few months were hard, but I learned to forgive her past actions over time.

A year goes by and I go in and out of jobs and volunteering, with my mental health and attacks flaring up every now and again, too often to hold steady work. I also get denied disability, so my welfare pretty much only covers me buying my own food and some luxuries like games if I have enough left over. It’s not enough to rent a place, pay for driving lessons, save up for a car etc and I still need loans from my grandmother sometimes (more on her later). Oh by the way, the reason I don’t drive now is because I asked for lessons at 17, my mother said “you can’t drive if you have autism”, I accepted his and made no fuss when she gave my step-dad money for driving lessons for his two daughters. She denies this but I remember it.

Anyway, the latest development came this past Tuesday (it’s Friday as I’m typing this). As part of my jobseeking, I joined a programme for young people to develop social skills and get into work, which my mother agreed was a good idea. The second week of the programme was a residential trip in Wales, something I was reluctantly excited about. Being autistic, and having had things done to me in rooms full of boys that I won’t go over here, I laid down some ground rules to my bunk mates about touching me, being the eldest. These were not followed by a 17M with behavioural difficulties, who kept slapping my belly in the night to the point that I had a flashback and spent the night screaming. I woke up, had two panic attacks, the boy apologised sincerely and everyone agreed it was best for me to go home and start fresh on Monday, as did my grandmother and aunt, who were waiting for me at home and were very sympathetic. When my mum got home, however, she was furious that I hadn’t stood up for myself and told me not to go back. Not “I don’t think it’s a good idea”, more like “I am your mother and you won’t go back.” Anyway, fast forward to today where I have an induction session for trauma therapy and I tell my therapist all of this. She calls my mother abusive and tells me that she’s making some calls about putting me up in a safe apartment in my town. I accept this, relieved that I’ll be out of her hair, but I don’t think it’s quite that far, hence why I’m putting the “am I overreacting” tag. I feel like everyone’s parents are flawed and I’m just a spoiled manchild.

The other person I worry about is my grandmother. I love her very dearly and I pretty much live with her and my grandad some weekends, but she denies everything my mum did. I’m scared that if I come out about what’s happened and I end up in emergency housing, she’ll disavow me. My mum manipulates her, telling her everything is my fault and I’m from Hell every time we argue. I’ve had comments from other relatives I love dearly saying things like “she’s just a normal mum, that’s how I raised your cousins and they turned out fine”, either because they’re oblivious or my mum has manipulated them too.

I’m at a crossroads. Should I move out or am I just being entitled? Is my mother an abuser or is she just looking out for me and I’m taking this too far because of how my autism makes me see the world?

EDIT: I want to thank everybody for the support. I’m definitely moving out. Telling everyone is a different story, I’m not going to announce it until a couple of days before I move.",JUSTNOMIL
"So, my bio mom has antisocial personality disorder. And BPD (I have BPD to, so if you want to remark on how bad it is please refrain from doing so, or I will delete and report your comment) she wants to get back into my life.

"Wasn't sure how to flair this, but all input is welcome and helpful because I have a difficult time understanding this woman.

""Hi MIL, I'm doing fine thanks. Extremely pregnant and not really in the mood for chats.

I've been respectful of your desire to keep a distant relationship with me for the past 5+ years and I would appreciate the same treatment as I prepare for the baby. There's been a lot of time to build a relationship with me over the years and you've chosen not to get to know me which is fine, but suddenly trying to socialize now comes across as you only caring because I'm pregnant/near my due date and not because you actually want a relationship. I will not deny access to the baby but I'm not going out of my way to accommodate at this point. I want you guys to have a normal healthy grandparent/grandchild relationship with her but that will have to be organized through your own son, not me. I won't impose on your grandparent relationship, but the extent of our relationship has been established over many years and any changes to it will take time, not just a few months and a couple chats. 

I'm not looking to open up a discussion about this, just making sure we're both on the same page and that you know to go through SO for anything pregnancy/baby related.""

&amp;#x200B;

Her response:

""I'm so sad about this. It's breaking my heart. If you think I've been distant, its only because I thought you hated my guts and didn't want anything to do with me. When I wrote you that note and gave you the necklace, I meant every word I wrote. I have never talked bad about you. I even reached out to you last summer when we were gone and SO wasn't home. I couldn't care whether you were having a baby or not. I'm sorry.""

The note and necklace she was talking about was a Christmas present after they found out about baby. It was cheap sterling silver necklace that isn't something I'd ever wear and the note said something about how we've had our differences and she hopes we can move past that. I was unable to decipher half the note because it was written really messily which was unusual for her. I'm not sure what she means about reaching out last summer. My husband was working down in the States for a couple months and I had them over for coffee once because they wanted to see our puppy. Maybe that's what she means? 

Currently I'm planning on not replying because I think her response is stupid and she's just trying to play the victim. I especially liked the part where she said ""I have never talked bad about you."" Okay lady, first of all that wasn't brought up and second of all, your entire family refused to shake my hand or introduce themselves to me when I met them the first time. They even turned their backs on me and blatantly ignored me when I tried to introduce myself. 

Does she think I'm a total idiot? I will admit I don't really understand her angle. Kinda feels as though she's trying to guilt trip me and play the victim card. Everyone in her family walks on eggshells with her and lets her act like an asshole because ""that's just the way she is, deal with it"" so maybe a little dose of truth was hard for her to swallow. I'm not sure if she's said anything to SO yet as he's working late. I did warn him and he's muted his phone and is bringing home milkshakes. 

I will say that I feel very relieved now! So glad that this community exists because I probably wouldn't have said anything if I hadn't been getting such great advice and reading other peoples stories as well.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hey everyone, I wasn't expecting to be back this soon...and I'm really just wanting to gauge - Am I overreacting? Am I just looking for things to be upset about at this point or being too sensitive? This is long, I'm sorry - I'm not short winded.  


So obviously when it comes to wedding planning, not everyone is going to like what you plan...but like, FMIL (ButterBitch) doesn't like aaaaanything and it is getting to me.  


FDH was talking to her last night to address dietary restrictions (ongoing issue) with the rehearsal dinner menu she had chosen. Myself and my siblings are lactose intolerant...I'm actually entirely milk product intolerant and not about to eat food that makes me bloat like crazy the night before I get married. He talks around the point instead of getting to it, lumping me in as a picky eater with my siblings, which I'm betting she loved even though he didn't do it on purpose. She loves to think of my dietary restrictions as me just being picky and not liking good food.   


So the conversation about the meal planning wasn't the smoothest, but she eventually conceded to THINKING about including a hamburger (something FDH and I have both already eaten from the place) instead of the dairy-only items she had chosen. She's not happy with it of course because of the reviews online about the hamburger. Even though that's the only thing on the menu we have had and we both loved it.  


Next comes talk of walking down the isle, we're going to have her escorted so she 1) goes where she's supposed to and 2) feels a little special. My bridesman and one of his groomsmen will be handling this...but FDH makes sure to point out how awkward it would be if HE were the one walking her down (no one mentioned him doing this until that point so it made me anxious, this is just a FDH issue).   


We go back to talking about the rehearsal dinner and timing, she chooses the latest of my range and states she was thinking 6pm. FDH agrees and she starts to go into how '6pm is still soooooo early for dinner, at least for a NORMAL dinner, I don't know why we can't have it start a little later' and I'm getting worked up because we've TOLD her why multiple times (wedding is in the morning, we still have to all shower at my dad's cabin after dinner)...FDH is focused on me getting worked up and doesn't hear the comments made by BB. He later tries telling me she never said that - but eventually conceded that he just didn't hear it. She also tries to convince FDH to let her send mail-in invitations for the rehearsal despite some of my bridesmaids already telling me they don't want her having their address.  


Comments are made AGAIN about how 'we're stuck eating at this place' and 'this is the problem with choosing somewhere so far away from everything'...we're happy with our location, she has made complaints about the location since the beginning. First it was bears she was afraid of, then it was the 'freezing temps' that don't happen, now it's just lack of restaurants SHE wants to eat at.   


Finally, comments are made about our centerpieces. We are asking for help from people as wedding gifts instead of hiring vendors. Everyone's on board and we're excited! She chose to set up centerpieces...she brought this up by telling me she was 'imagining large floral arrangements'. We've told her before we aren't doing flowers, we're doing foliage. I send her pics of the set up we practiced at my mom's. On the phone, after seeing the photos, she still tells FDH 'oh yes, I'll be putting SOME flowers out with the other stuff' and he corrects her and she finally concedes...'well, yes, I saw what OP sent me. It looks like some jars with vines or something in it....are you guys just planning on collecting those outside the venue?'   


We're doing a table runner with potpourri mirroring 'falling leaves' and vases filled with water and fern leaves. It looks beautiful.   


So throughout this conversation, I got upset and then more upset the more jabs that were thrown. It's just that she has criticized EVERYTHING at every turn. There's not one thing she likes, not one nice thing she has said about anything we've planned except 'oh, your dress is actually very classy, I wasn't expecting that!' FDH doesn't catch a lot of the jabbing comments and he's stated that he's going to start recording conversations with her (even when I'm not in the room) so we can go over them later and I can point them out to him...but am I maybe just looking for reasons to be offended here? Or am I actually planning a bad wedding?",JUSTNOMIL
"I swear to god this woman gets to me. 
I have what I consider to be a JNFMIL, but it could just be me overreacting to some BEC. 

a few reasons why I hate this woman are:

• she refuses to let me use Tide laundry detergent. She buys the detergent, as I usually don’t have enough to buy my own after bills and food, but I have asked her to get Tide as opposed to the Xtra she gets for me, BF, S, and B. She uses Tide herself but won’t do as I ask. Now this sounds super silly over detergent but the whole reason why I can’t use Xtra is because I’m very very allergic to whatever is in that detergent. I figured this out a few years ago after I started getting severe hives and was tested to figure out the reason why. I do not want to come off as snotty or entitled, I just genuinely need to use anything other than Xtra. It doesn’t have to be Tide but she already buys Tide for herself so I thought it would be more convenient. Idk. 

• when she takes S and B out to eat, she leaves me and BF out. We’ve discussed with her how this hurts us, and she still does it. I understand not buying me food, but her son? Idk. I just don’t get why she can’t include him. Don’t even buy him food, just invite him to sit down with you! She doesn’t ever acknowledge his presence as her first born. 

• she tried to tell me I couldn’t have a lock on my door after her daughter and son had stolen from me and destroyed things that are my property, yet 12 y.o S has a lock on her door and she shares her room with B. It’s her house but if I can’t have a lock then discipline needs to happen so I no longer have to sacrifice my belongings. 

• she is constantly BITCHING at BF. When he changes the trash, she never ever fails to remind him to replace the bag in the can. Which is fine, that’s completing the job of taking out the trash. But when she doesn’t put a bag in the can after SHE takes out the trash, she expects us to do it for her and gets mad if we don’t, but then gets mad if we don’t put a bag in the can when we’re the ones who take it out. Idk. 

Everything about this woman annoys me. She has a boyfriend who lives with us who’s been here for like 6 months and he thinks he can order me around the house like a damn dog. He swears at me, stomps around, etc. all around acts like a damn teen. This man is 30. Way too young and immature to even be with this woman. I’ve gotten into altercations with both of them and now it’s causing rifts in my relationship. Lately BF has been getting better about standing up for us, but it doesn’t really make a difference. 

Am I overreacting? What do I do? I can’t move out, so getting out is not an option. I need real advice outside of ‘move out’. Please help.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hello there sub..... I just...... sorry, its been a rough few months, a bit longer since the last time I properly posted and right now I really need a third party to listen to me.

I nuked a bit of my post history because I was kinda of afraid but the tl:dr of my situation is this; failed to lauch into life, stuck a parents home. Both just no in their own ways.

I have come to you today because after the fight they had yesterday I just can't take anymore, I do not want to take any more. Its the first time I used the word want in that phrase....

The more I think about it the more I notice that my problems are not mine, I am in the middle of their fights, their lives. More so of her. And I feel that every time I get to do something on my own for myself something happens that makes me become her lacky again.... and I just get sucked back into it again.

After a point.... it can't just be me. I mean, I know that a lot of my bad descions and current situation is my fault. I know that but everytime I seem to start working to my own betterment I either fail or get nowhere and then fall back in.....

She calls me and I flinch.

My problems are hers, a lot of my life is around her.... and she has been looking for a replacement for her father since he died nearly 20 years ago, my paternal grandfather couldn't do it, my dad couldn't be...... now its my turn and I can't neither want to be. Not  atleast while being son, lackey, shrink and sonband......

So be honest, it is not just me, right? Its also the place and situaton that does not let me grow?

Its just..... that not only I do not know what I want, but I do not know how.......

I... the worst part is that there is litterally nowhere I can go. The family has long been  broken apart, the most stupid family feud you can think of, all happened when I was a child, totally inocent of this but I am feeling the impact into my adulthood. Not that anything of value was lost but still.

The only family I can think off is my justnoaunt and her partner, both have beem harping for a long time for me to be independant, may be if I ask them to move there for a while?. If anything on a short vacation to clear my head.

Its just I truly do not know. I sometimes feel like a bird crashing againts my cage not knowing the door is open. Not knowing how to fly.
The other part is that I feel that I have advance as much as I could, have grown as much as I could and I am not allowed to grow any more.

So, I am crazy? Or I am right?


May be the fog has been far more effective in the indoctrination than I thought it was. At which point is just me and after which point is my enviorment?",JUSTNOMIL
"I've been sitting on this for a bit just in case my JNM ""DN"" is still lurking /internet stalking me.

At the tail end of what had otherwise been a fairly quiet weekend, FDH and I woke up to someone knocking on our front door. 

I tried looking through the peephole to see who was there, but whoever it was stood just out of view for me to be unable to make them out.

So I ignored them since we aren't expecting anyone, and figured if it were someone we knew they wouldn't be showing up unannounced. I just got out of bed, I'm basically just in my underwear still, I'm not answering the door for a rando. 

Another knock.

Ok... A stranger probably wouldn't persist like this so I try looking through the peephole again, but by the time I get there our doorstep is empty. Weird.

A few minutes pass and there's another knock, I look again, recognize my step-dad at the door, and panic as everything in me sinks through the floor.

I wait a little longer, honestly stuck at this point while still hoping he'll go away... but I also know he probably saw our car, and hence knows we're most likely home.

Idk how long I was frozen there for, but he eventually leaves again.

Then my phone starts ringing. Sure enough it's my stepdad. I panic, begging FDH to answer and tell him I can't talk right now, hoping to buy myself time to collect myself and process wtf was about to happen. 

As we're arguing over who's going to pick it up, we end up just missing the call anyways. 

I hadn't heard from my stepdad since before all the shit hit the fan, but I had sent him a final text after disengaging with JNM letting him know I'm done with her as she's out of control, and that I didn't want anymore drama but figured I'd let him know he should probably get her some serious help. Which had been a week ago at that point. He never responded, and the next day had blocked me on social media. So what could he want? 

FDH convinces me to get it over with and just call back to see, so I do. My stepdad asks if we're home and I blurt out yes, but that we'd literally just woken up. Stepdad asks if we can talk, and I ask if it's just him. He says yes, so I reluctantly agree. He offered to bring us breakfast and sounded friendly enough, but I still couldn't shake my feelings of dread. 

Soon there's another knock at the door, and FDH answers to let him in.

Stepdad opens by saying he doesn't know what's going on, but that he's here to ""mediate""... Which initially seems to take the form of a guilt trip, until he asks me to explain my side of the situation.

I fill him in, and come to find out that of course he has been told a very different version of things. 

He was lead to believe that I'm just talking shit here out of nowhere about my poor loving mother, on what she described to him as a public forum, with no mention of it being completely anonymous. 

He didn't understand why I'd do this, because he thought everything had been going well between all of us after even going on a couple day trips together last summer. 

I said yeah, that's what I thought too... Until my mother stalked me online, doxed my reddit account, and blew up our entire relationship out of nowhere (for the umpteenth time now), because she didn't like that I was sharing my traumatic childhood with online strangers- which cast her in a less than flattering light (literally the worst thing I'd said at that point was that she wasn't perfect *GASP*). 

But of course she's so up her own asshole, that she is incapable of accepting that it's her who made all of this 1000000× worse by not even ""allowing"" me that. 

No instead she confronted me, and when that didn't work even texted FDH behind my back, trying to convince him there was ""something very wrong with OP"", but that she doesn't believe I have the conditions I've been professionally diagnosed with, but there's definitely ""something wrong with the state OP is in"". 

Which is it bitch? Am I just crazy, or am I crazy for thinking I'm crazy? And doesn't that make me crazy either way? 🤯

Turns out she'd also gone on my stepdads social media behind his back and blocked me herself, because he had no idea about that either. 

But you know, of course she's not crazy either... 

Whatever. 

I get done explaining everything, and he surprisingly seemed fairly understanding. Of course he's not going to take a side against his wife, but I didn't ask him to.

Then he asks FDH what his opinion on all of this is.

So FDH starts by refuting multiple lies JNM fed my stepdad. 

For example, my mother is apparently upset because somewhere on my compromised account I told someone about how she likes to remind me all the time that she almost aborted me. For some reason she thinks it's funny or interesting... or something? Idk why she says over half the shit she does. 

But what a horrible lie for me to make up about her! Not once had she ever said that... Except she has, multiple times even, AND IN FRONT OF FDH. 

Idiot. 

Stepdad was very obviously taken off guard by this, but insisted on maintaining his ""neutrality"" almost convincingly. 

After multiple things had now been debunked my stepdad eventually asks FDH how he thinks we should proceed, because at this point its clearly established that FDH is the ""reasonable"" one in our relationship (LMAO... not only is this not the case but FDH has much ""harsher"" views towards my mother than even I do most of the time). 

Stepdad is at a loss because it's still just so sad that my own mother won't be at my wedding, she just loves me so much, and he sees her cry every day.

I say I don't doubt that, but the way she loves me isn't healthy and I can't be around that when I'm trying to recover from the four different disorders I've been diagnosed with BECAUSE OF HER. 

Stepdad didn't even know about my conditions, and responds in shock ""that's a lot of disorders"".

Yeah. I know. 

He actually apologized for his part in how I grew up, and insisted that he's changed. Which I said I believe he absolutely has, while my mother unfortunately very clearly has not. 

FDH tells my stepdad that he has been talking with his therapist about everything that's gone down, and even read them ALL the messages between us and JNM... To which his therapist said that my mother is without a doubt mentally ill. 

A therapist can't/doesn't just say that lightly, considering as a professional they can't make any diagnosis without actually working with JNM as a patient. But that's just how blatantly and objectively horrid my mothers behavior is.

FDH reinforced the decision to uninvite JNM from the upcoming wedding, told stepdad that we need an extended break from her (permanent NC is his actual preference), and ended it by suggesting she get serious help with her obvious mental health issues.

I think I fell in love with FDH all over again, but that could just be me swooning over his shiny spine.

Ultimately my stepdad left saying that he's sorry it's all come to this, but that it sounds like I need my boundaries respected and that they need to give me space, whether it's 5 years of space or a decade.

We awkwardly hugged and he left...

That was potentially the last time I'll see my stepdad, and I don't really know how to feel about it. It wasn't a necessarily unpleasant interaction, but it's left me feeling anxious ever since. 

Before this I also had texted my teenage brother letting him know I'm always here for him, that I love him, and that what's gone on is between me/our mom and has nothing to do with him. 

I also stressed I was mostly just texting him to say he's still more than welcome to come to the wedding, and that I'll understand if he can't but it'd mean a lot if he decides to. 

I never heard anything back, and while there are plenty of possibilities as to why... It still feels really shitty. I basically raised him all the way up until I threw everything I owned into garbage bags, and left that miserable house as soon as I hit the age of 18. I honestly don't know if he'll ever get to that point, so I might never see or speak to him again either. 

All in all, I feel like it can't possibly be the end of this JNM nightmare... I just don't exactly know how to feel at peace, since I can't shake the dread of waiting for the other shoe to drop.

"Hey guys, 
Back with more bs from my fmil, and I think this time DH is just about ready to cut all contact. Yesterday his mom showed up (again, and obviously uninvited...) at our previous apartment, then called DH screaming and crying about how “i can’t believe you moved and didn’t tell me, if you don’t want me in your life, fine” and the usual guilt trippy stuff. He then received this text from his dad: 

https://imgur.com/a/ZkLTQGl

And then today his mom called his place of work, and he didn’t answer because he knew the number. Then a few minutes later she comes into his work screaming “you need to get out here right now” in front of customers. He followed her outside (I think he was afraid of getting in trouble with his boss) and she started her usual yelling bs making him feel bad about himself and making him feel like his family hates him and all that. She also harassed him for our new address (he told her a different city about 45 min away from us)?She then proceeded to leave him with several large baby things that we have repeatedly said we do not want, need or have space for. He then went into the bathroom at work and cried for a good half hour. 

Any advice/words of encouragement on cutting contact, how to deal with future events, etc (for him) would be great. I’ll be showing him the comments :) 

Also just wanted to throw in a quick thank you to all of you for listening to me b*tch about these issues. Your comments are great and really helped us to come to the conclusion we need to cut them out of our lives. :)",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi everybody! Been reading posts on here for almost two years now but this is my first post. I have many stories to tell and I will continue to do so everyone gets the full story. 

For background: Bf and I have been together about 4 years, we have two DD’s first DD will be two in July, second is 4 months old. We are not married &amp; are not really in a rush to get married. Both of us are full time students and he works full time as well. We live with my parents who are justyes, they help us in so many ways &amp; we really appreciate it. They respect us and love their granddaughters very much. 

So last time my FMIL (which is what I will refer to her for now) visited us, it ended very badly. Long story short, she asked to come over and visit with DD1 and DD2, said she would be here at 130, texts me around 230 saying she’s on her way. Shows up at 330 no call, no text no nothing. The whole time this was happening, my bf was golfing with a friend. We had dinner plans with her and my justyes parents around 430. We hang out until it’s time to leave for dinner, dinner was horrible but that’s a story for another time. We end dinner around 7 and she assumes she can come back to our house and get the visit she missed earlier with her granddaughters. I told my bf absolutely no, we will see you in the morning to say goodbye cuz she was leaving (thank god). Well the next morning comes around &amp; my bf has school and will be gone all day. So I’m expected to hangout with his mom and say goodbye. Well I was still annoyed about the night before and she has a tendency of just showing up and calling when she’s at the door. There’s a knock at the door while I’m breastfeeding DD2, I check my phone. She’s calling as she’s knocking at the door. I didn’t answer because I’m topless and completely caught off guard. She leaves after about 5 mins of knocking. She was so upset she didn’t get to say goodbye to DD1 and DD2 which I understand &amp; I would have maybe apologized if she didn’t take it so far. 

She blows up my bf’s phone anything ranging from 
 
• I need my ass beat and I’m soooo disrespectful 
• she’s telling her son he deserves better and I better not treat him how I treat her 
• she’ll sue for grandparent rights (she lives in a diff. State as us and has nooo grounds to sue us). 
• she will never step foot in my house again 
• she wants no contact with me ever again, I’m dead to her &amp; I will never be her family. 
• since I’m not family and never will be, she blocked me on social media (which I never really use because she would steal all my photos of DD1). 

The problem now: DD1 will be two in July and I’m sooo excited for this party, I’ve been planning it for 6 months. She texted my bf asking what the plans were for DD1’s birthday and he replied invites will be sent out in the next 2 weeks. Ummm yeah but not to her, she’s not invited. Someone who threatened to beat me up and said she would never come over again wants to come over???? The party will be at our house (she is extremely jealous that my veryjustyes mom gets to see the DD’s everyday) and I don’t even want to see her face. I can’t trust that she wouldn’t make a scene and ruin the party. How do I tell bf she is not invited??
 

My bf is deep in the fog &amp; I need help on how to handle this. Advice appreciated!",JUSTNOMIL
"I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist for PTSD and depression issues from many violent, manipulative, and abusive experiences that mostly my mother, sister, paternal grandparents and my brother (I list him last because he was only abusive to me physically because they used him as a test kid for ADHD meds that made him hear voices that told him to do what he did and hasn’t hit me since being off the meds) and I had to stop speaking to my mother right before my birthday, April 12th, for gaslighting me about how I never suffered sexual assault (paternal grandparents or any of the ones I’ve went through or almost went through through the years ‘because of anything, it would have happened to [my] sister’) and telling me that I needed to stop taking my meds and not talk to the doctors anymore because ‘she is there for me, knows her children, and no one else is going to be there for me like she is.’

She said a lot of things that made me question my own and her reality that was not supportive, loving, and alienating.

Mother’s Day rolls around and my sister (with 3 kids) tells me that she doesn’t know what happened with me and mom, she doesn’t want to know, but I should call mom because she would want that from her kids.

Fair, but then I told her all of what mom said to me. She takes a few days to respond and when she does, she says that she spoke to mom, is worried about me, wants me to stop seeing my psych/taking my meds, to move back to my home area, and she doesn’t know why I think these things happened but [my sister and mother] want to help me be who I was.

Who I was was someone who fantasized about dying since I was 3-4, drank since 10yo, and was always told by these two ppl how I couldn’t trust anyone else I told them about (friends, boyfriends, bosses, ppl I worked/went to school with) because they’d always leave me but family was forever.

I got sober last August (3rd) and have been slowly but surely breaking down the walls and defenses I’ve put up over the years (30f). I want to be an open and loving person and I want to keep good people in my life that help me grow, develop, see the world for the good it can have, and point out how my way of thinking is detrimental to who I want to strive to be.

My meds have made me happy for the first time in almost 3 decades. I remember being happy in our old lilac bush because no one else could fit there to get me. It was my secret garden and I was safe in that bush. After we moved, there was no place to hide and I could only close the bathroom door. My meds make me feel FREE. I’m not scared walking down the street, going through grocery stores, or walking into friend’s homes. My brain isn’t constantly saying how everyone hates me and I hate me and I should die. My brain isn’t telling me how fat I am when I’m 5’5” and 145 lbs. I can wake up and not want to die. I know I’ve said that twice but it’s soooo important. 

Thank you so much for letting me rant. I’m just so thankful to not have my mom’s voice in my head anymore. I’ve never thought how detrimental her and my sister are for me but my mom was the one that always stayed in contact. My sister has been sparse with communication since birthing children.

Just...thank you.",JUSTNOMIL
"Long time no see! This isn’t an update on my previous post of many moons ago (which I will get to eventually- the wedding is in two months), but it’s something that happened recently that I’m honestly still in shock over. 

Also: I’ve decided to call my mom Admiral Ackbar, due to everything with her being a trap. 

Backstory: I have my own iCloud account but I’m attached to my dad’s Family Sharing account purely so I can leech off their Apple Music account like the cheapskate I am. 

Recently I had lunch with my dad, and we were making pleasantries, having a good time, when suddenly he blurts out “you should turn your Find My iPhone off”. Now, we have lunch fairly often, and we don’t tell Ackbar about it, because she has a mad jealous streak and would probably tear my dad a new asshole for not inviting her (even though, you know, she works). So I presume it’s because he doesn’t want her to know we’re at lunch. 

But then I think about it a little more. 

And it occurs to me; how could she possibly see we’re at lunch unless she actively chooses to look it up?

So I ask my dad, “why, do you think she’d check?” and he breaks it to me that, “periodically” (which I suspect he’s playing down to sound better than it is), Ackbar stalks me out on Find My iPhone to see where I am. 

I’m 24, you guys, what the hell. 

My immediate response is to go into my family sharing, and disable her specifically seeing me. I don’t disable my dad or my brother, because I figure it’s handy in case I ever lose my phone. But honestly, I’m horrified that she thinks that’s okay. My dad is horrified too, and has tried to talk to her more than once, but she consistently blows him off about it. 

Cut to a few nights ago. I get a panic text from my dad: “can you turn off Find My iPhone for your brother and I?” I ask why, and he says that my brother was on his phone at dinner and laughed about how he could see where I was (he’s a minor, and a moron, so he gets a pass for that one). Ackbar immediately flies into a RAGE, demands to see my dad’s phone and *actively tries to snatch it off him* to see if I’m there. Thankfully, I got to the account first, so she just thinks my shit is broken. If she ever asks, I’ll say “why do you need it?” and if she’s honest, I’ll very plainly tell her that *that’s really fucking weird.*

The moral here? Boundaries are good. Especially for things you didn’t think you needed to have boundaries about.",JUSTNOMIL
"So obligatory long time lurker, first time poster. Some background, D(ear)H and I have been together since I was 15 and he was 17 (we are 31 and 33 now), my JNMIL is honestly mostly just a BEC, no where near as bad as most of the stories I read here, but she’s driving me up the wall right now with various things that I may post about later as my poor husband is sick of me venting to him about his mom. This is an old story that is a great example of her craziness that is now mostly funny (though still absolutely maddening) that I thought some people might get a kick out of. 

When I was 21 and then BF(now DH) was 23 we were saving to buy a house. We were both still living at home (he just moved back home after a roommate situation went badly), but I worked and went to university closer to his moms house, and because evenings were often the only time we got to see each other I ended up over there quite often after either work or class. This was happening often enough that I had a dufflebag full of clothes and things I needed that I kept in my car/his place. 

So one day his mom starts going off about how since “I’m living there” I should unpack and stop living out of a duffle. I ignored her, since we’d already been having an ongoing issue with her going into BFs room and taking clothes to do laundry despite us telling her several times not to. (Side note: she JUST brought this up at a BBQ we had this weekend, and said she did this because it’s apparently hard to do a full load for a single person?). She also ruined several items after I asked her not to do my laundry because she never read washing instructions and didn’t care that I told her I wash ALL my clothes in cold water and hang to dry or they shrink lengthwise. Anyways, after a few weeks of her nagging us both to put my stuff in drawers/the closet I relented. BF had a dresser with 6 drawers. I unloaded some underwear/socks into his underwear/sock drawer, I put some PJs into his PJ drawer, and I put the rest of my stuff into one other drawer. The two shared drawers were not half and half, and my “full” drawer wasn’t full either, because I didn’t have a ton of stuff there. Anyways a week or so later we go visit a friend about 1.5 away for the day and when we get back (f)MIL is bouncing up and down she’s so excited. We sit down and start watching TV with her, and she interrupts the show almost immediately to tell us her news. She’s so excited, she unpacked for me since you know, neither of us had listened when she asked us to do this for the last month 🙄
I froze. I sat there trying not to cry until she went to bed about an hour later. When she did, I went to BFs bedroom and started crying and raging and packing my shit into my bag. Clueless BF doesn’t understand what’s wrong, because he’s used to his mom being totally invasive. I finally say to him “BF, you know I already unpacked last week. Which means she went through DRAWERS to “unpack”. (Also, her “unpacking” was moving his PJs to his sock/underwear drawer and moving my socks/underwear to the PJ drawer, because god forbid our undergarments touch 🙄 and also to take his remaining 3 drawers and condense them into 2 so things were “fair”, and spread my half empty drawer into the now vacant drawer that had husbands things. His 2 drawers are bursting they’re so full, and my drawers are half empty, and the second one has 2 items: my vibrator, and my work apron, which she has laid over top of my vibrator. She emptied the drawer completely except the vibrator, and then she found an apron and placed it over top, idk, for discretion?! I packed up all my shit and noped the fuck out of there. Told BF he needed to tell her how wrong she was, and how she needed to apologize if he ever wanted me to come back. 

After 2 or 3 days, he still has not been able to convince her she did anything wrong, because “it’s her house” and she “just wanted me to feel like I was welcome there by not living out of a suitcase”. Well by this point my embarrassment had given way to pure rage. I headed over there, walked in and turned the tv off in a total power move and said “we need to talk”. We then proceeded to discuss why it was so invasive, why she is not allowed to go through my things, without mentioning my vibrator at first. She keeps deflecting, telling me her intentions trump my feelings. So I say “ok, elephant in the room, you found my vibrator. I KNOW you found it because of the obnoxious way you covered it up, do you not see how absolutely invasive that is”. She then says “srose, I’ve been single for 15 years, there’s no need to be embarrassed, it’s not like I’ve never had / used one”. BF at this point covers his ears and starts singing lalalalala as he tries to get the fuck out of the room. I tell her that whether she owns one isn’t the point, and that I now don’t even feel like a guest in her home, because at least when I was a guest she didn’t go through my things. 

Sorry this got so long so I’ll wrap up quickly. I kept my bag in my car with me from that point on, and started sleeping at my house about 90% more often than I had been even if that meant I went home super late. Ironically, MIL always talks about how this moment is the reason she respects me so much, because we talked and sorted things out and it didn’t turn into WW3. 🙄 She still has never apologized or acknowledged she stepped over major boundaries, and probably still thinks we “solved” this issue, when in reality I realized the conversation was going no where and I was never going to convince her she was wrong so I just decided then and there I wouldn’t give her the opportunity in the future to boundary cross. 

Hope you enjoyed my introduction to my admittedly mild JNMIL.",JUSTNOMIL
"My little brother was recently in town and staying at my parent's house while he recovered from back surgery. We decided to meet for lunch the day before he flew home.

&amp;#x200B;

I got a text from my mom at 10 pm the night before that said:

&gt;\[Your brother\] says he is driving down for lunch. If I have time I want to come.

&amp;#x200B;

I've essentially been NC with her after some bullshit she pulled a few months ago, so the idea that I would want to spend lunch with her was ludicrous to begin with. little brother did not invite her, nor did she ask little brother if she could come. I said ""I'd like to see you soon, but tomorrow I'm going to hang with just \[my brother\].""

&amp;#x200B;

This was her response:

&gt;Oh. So I'm not allowed. That makes me feel swell. Thanks.  
&gt;  
&gt;I guess i'm just sooo horrid it's just too awful to include me.  
&gt;  
&gt;What an insult. Have a great night.

&amp;#x200B;

I did not respond.

She has used this tactic with me too many times to count, and i used to fall for it and feel awful and think I was a horrible daughter. No more.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks to therapy and this sub I can now set boundaries and not give in. And it feels good.

"So, in my last MIL post, Sparky sent out a bullshit guilt trip text and made me BIG MAD. DH promised to talk to her but hadn't yet.

So, just one week later, DH finally talked to her. It went surprisingly well. He managed to not yell at her like he wanted, but he was blunt and didn't sugarcoat it. I wasn't there because DH said (and I quote directly ""I don't need your hormones making the situation explosive."" Which, valid. I get it. I can be a bit explosive recently.

He told me that he covered all the parts I wanted covered. And it seems like he did. He brought her over after breakfast to see the (finally!!) completed nursery, and she was kind. She hugged me before he took her home and said ""I'm sorry about that text. I shouldn't have sent it."" I was shocked and amazed! I hugged her back and said ""I get you're having a hard time."" 

Later, DH explained to me that part of the reason she sent it is that she felt lonely and like nobody cares, because nobody really comes around. He told her that nobody comes around because SIL1 is a miserable bitch, and gave her direct examples, including her cunty Mother's Day plans texts. DH doesn't ever delete his texts, and I will liberally employ the power of a screenshot, so we make a dangerous combo lol

DH had me invite Sparky (and his SILs) for dinner. SIL1 came with Sparky, and SIL5 came over. Sparky actually got onto SIL1 when she started being a bitch, but that's a story for JNFAMILY, not here. I was shocked and pleased. 

Maybe Sparky is learning. Maybe it's a temporary rise. I have hope. Am I a fool for it?",JUSTNOMIL
"Basically the title says it all (mobile post). DH is still NC with her and FIL after the way they acted at BILs graduation. So besides ignoring their phone calls DH restricted SS on book face because he got tired of her trying to pretend like she's a loving caring mom on there. 

So first of all Susan is friends with my 73 year old JYgrandma on there. And she is trying to use my grandma as a tool to get information on me and DH. So flashback to when me and DH first got married, and me and SS had the really big fight over her stealing DH car title to get a loan (in post history) My grandma was unable to attend our wedding due to being in the hospital with pneumonia, what does Susan do? She calls MY grandma and is like "" I don't know why BlingBlawww is so ugly to me, I've done so much for her, me and FIL had to tell DH that she had to move out if she couldn't respect us"" which that last part isn't true. Cause she begged Me and DH to stay to help pay their bills, she's just trying to sound like hot shit. "" I don't know why BlingBlawww is so mad over the truck title it's not even hers, it's none of her business"" bitch you went snoopping through my shit and stole the one thing that was a valuable to DH at that time it is my MF business. And basically my grandma said "" BlingBlawww doesn't treat people like that unless she has a good reason, to me it seems like she has a good reason, I will not tolerate you talking about her like that to me, goodbye SS"" then Shady Susan went off and told DH that my grandma said, That I said ,she could no longer talk to Susan, I told DH to tell SS if she ever brings up my grandma again I was gonna break her fucking nose.

Now back to present day. Susan is trying to take my grandma out to lunch. Me and grandma already spoke about my grandma said "" I don't want to,she stresses me out and I don't like the way she talks about you"" Me: ""then grandma don't respond to her, me and DH are not speaking to her she's just trying to use you as a way of information to be nosey about us, do not fall for it, if you have to unfriend her on FB""

So after SS plan of trying to make a tool out of my grandma and that didn't work, now she's posting feel sorry for me shit on FB. We're not friends, but DH shows me. So after us not answering and my grandma not cooperating, she posts "" oh my God I almost drowned at hurricane harbor today"" and of course in the comments it's "" I had an anxiety attack"" that woman doesn't have any form of anxiety, she shouldn't use a serious issue that people truly suffer from as a way of attention, that's just wrong. DH said "" my mom is too fat to drown all she does is float"" 😂😂😂 woooow. And then she'll post "" I haven't heard from my oldest son in so long"" and then people start commenting ""shame on him etc"" and a lot are mutual friends. 

Anyways I really had to rant mostly about her trying to use my grandma. DH thinks her tendencies to want attention is hilarious, and still won't answer the phone. He said he's not sure on when he'll want to talk to them again, he said even if they did apologise it still wouldn't be the same for him. He doesn't plan on telling his dad happy Father's day either. Good for him. He said "" they wanted to start a fight over me calling my mom for mother's day, well now they don't have to even worrying about me actually Calling, then they'll have an actual reason to be mad. I'm so proud of him, his therapy has been working really well and his medication is really making a difference in his attitude, it's like he's back to his normal self. Thanks for listening to me rant.",JUSTNOMIL
"Background: see BitchBot for this.  

I’ve had a Bell’s Palsy.  Basically half of my face is a little droopy because I’ve lost muscle control.  Pretty harmless just annoying.  Mine is most likely from Lyme disease since it happened a few days after I pulled an embedded tick out of my hair (I visited my mom and hung out while she picked peaches.  Go figure lol).  But FDH came home from work and I legitimately look like I’m having a stroke so he freaked.  We went to the ER and started a battery of tests since my blood pressure was sky high.  I’ve been under a lot of stress with family illnesses so I wasn’t surprised that it’s high.  

Well FDH called FFIL because he was upset and just needed some support.  My own JYMom was on her way but is about 3 hours from us.  Well CW heard via another extension of the phone and hops on her broomstick and bursts in the room I’m in before FFIL can stop her.  She’s hysterical about her baaaaaaaaby being upset and how much stress I’m causing him.  The nurse had the most priceless look on her face.  FDH and the nurse immediately start shoving CW out of the room, and FFIL comes barreling in raising hell at her.  Y’all.  I was cracking up.  She made an absolute idiot of herself AT THE HOSPITAL SHE VOLUNTEERS AT.  So all hell has broken loose in the hallway because CW starts in on her nonsense about how much stress I cause FDH and I’m not worth it and the same broken record ish she normally spouts.  

Then the glorious thing happens.  Security arrives.  They ask what’s going on and CW is escorted out.  She gets outside and her car is being towed because this IDIOT left it sitting in the damn ambulance bay to run in and make a fool of herself.  I heard from FDH that when they got outside and saw that FFIL lost his Jesus and was screaming at CW.  Her car is impounded, she had to ride home with FFIL in shame (who just dumped her at home and came back to sit with us).  She’s now in trouble with the hospital auxiliary group, and is getting a major NC timeout from FDH.  Her siblings are even appalled and not taking her calls.  Thankfully my mom showed up a few minutes after CW left because my mom is a Marine Corp veteran who doesn’t take someone messing with her only child very well and probably would have drop kicked CW.  

Am I an asshole for getting some serious enjoyment from her getting shunned?!  Because I am.  It makes this whole numb face thing much easier to tolerate ha!",JUSTNOMIL
"It’s coming up on our 14 year anniversary of knowing each other. About a year in NM realized it was pretty serious. I was never home. (I hadn’t been ‘allowed’ to move out, was a 28 year old virgin when I’d met him). She had gone on a Holy Narc Crusade to split us up. “I don’t like him. I don’t LIKE him. Actually I HATE HIM!”  Said with that puke inducing Narc Glee in her face. The mask had slipped right off that day Jeeze. 

Any way. I was at his place. Had been for a few days. She was terrorizing me via email. But not talking to me. 

We were snuggled together in bed. Post coital like. Probably just a little weed had been smoked. Listening to music. 

And then Pink Floyd’s Mother came on. And every fucking word rang so god damn true. We were both perfectly still. I had my head pillowed on his chest. And both of our hearts just ceased to beat from the pain of how much that truth hurt. 

And I looked up. And he was crying too. Silently. Tears pouring down his face. Me too. Onto his chest. He hugged me tighter. We didn’t talk about it. Let the moment pass on its own. But when I looked up at the tears on his face I was warmed by one little thought “oh. He really does, really, really love me!”  

She’s the one who tried to make me choose. I picked him.

Mother, do you think they'll drop the bomb?
Mother, do you think they'll like the song?
Mother, do you think they'll try to break my balls?

"She finally lost her shit. I’m absolutely flabbergasted. Just saying, this story has everything, and I’m pretty much about to write a book, so buckle up. This covers the last six weeks, and I’m still in the middle of it, so any advice on the current issue at hand is more than welcome. 

To begin, six weeks ago my boyfriend and I had a huge fight unrelated to my mother that resulted in a dual domestic arrest. I was the true victim in that case, but my mother saw an opportunity for revenge for the time she got arrested when I was 14 for the same thing and so she told the cops she saw nothing. Therefore there were no witnesses and I was taken away in nothing but my shittiest, holiest sweatpants and a robe. 

(Just like how she was arrested in her nightgown and robe when I was 14 and my best friend caught her cheating on my dad at a restaurant and told me and my dad confronted her while she was getting ready for bed and she lost her fucking mind. Of course that was my fault. )

This caused a domino effect of me having no income and me being unable to pay rent, leaving her a window of opportunity to call me worthless, and start threatening to throw me out. After court, my boyfriend and I started working on repairing our relationship, no thanks to her, as I found that throughout the time there was a TPO, she had been contacting him (third party contact- if he had wanted to be a dick he could have gotten me arrested) and telling him any time our son bumped his head, or that I did anything she didn’t approve of. She was literally tattling on me. 

Also as a result of the domestic incident I now have a traumatic response to the smell of weed. So I stopped smoking and started going to meetings. It works for me. It pisses her off immensely. She refused to watch either child so I could go unless I paid her at least $20 per time, and she would only watch one of them, even if the baby was going to be asleep for the duration. But that’s normal for her. She used to let me borrow her car to go buy weed no problem, but if I needed it to take my daughter to urgent care, I’m an awful person she couldn’t trust that wouldn’t come back so I had to let her do it and let the nurse call me for permission to treat.

So anyway, once he and I started talking again she got worried. Because during the three week hiatus he got a new apartment and she had thought he was going to move back in and keep giving her money. Once it became apparent that was definitely NOT the case, she ramped things up. 

Anytime I would leave the room she would tell my SO I was dangerous and he needed to get the baby away from me, and she was afraid of me because I was sooooo violent. Every day she picked a fight and told me to get out, and every day I told her I would get out after I was served with eviction papers, as I had no income and nowhere else to go. She said I was spiteful and wanted her to lose her deposit, but no, I just had nowhere else to go. At the time, my boyfriend and I had no plans to move back in together until such a time as we felt we were both on good enough footing to do so, so I started looking up options. There really weren’t any. So I started making friends with the idea of being homeless with my daughter, as my son was on my boyfriends lease. 

The Thursday before Memorial Day I had an appointment with a psychologist, to finally get a diagnosis, as I had been dropped by my last shrink when I got pregnant with my son and she said I was “mood disorder not otherwise specified” so I wanted to know what I was, as I’ve been misdiagnosed 12 different ways over 20 years. I got my boyfriend to watch the kids, and my good friend who had been taking me to meetings to take me to the appointment. 

Here’s where it gets fun though. This was the best doctor I’ve ever seen. She actually listened to me, and then EXPLAINED her findings to me. She said, “Having emotions is not inherently pathological.” And when I looked confused, she was like, you have anxiety due to the lifestyle you have and the environment you live in. To which I said, “...And?” And nothing. Guys, I’m NOT CRAZY!! I’ve picked up a fuckton of fleas but I have no disorders. I respond in a normal fashion to the avalanche of bullshit in my life. So I have a twice a day low dose anxiety med, which is working like gangbusters, btw, and they’re setting me up with regular therapy. That’s it.  

So ends the pleasant part of the story. During my appointment my SO had to go back to work, so my friend offered to run back to my house and watch the kids, as the facility offers Lyft service, so they could get me home. I accepted. 

When the troll got home he (my friend who is an ex who came out and is now married to my sponsor-yes, complicated like the rest of my life, lol) was alone with the kids and my mom started telling him bizarre things. He texted me after one thing in particular she said to him, like she had been there and he hadn’t. (We had had a very bad argument once over a floor lamp. I wanted it on so I could read, he wanted it off so he could sleep. We wound up wrestling over it in the dark and it came apart at the middle and I was holding the bottom and he was holding the top half and it smacked him in the face and it broke his tooth. ) She said to him, “Remember when illusionairy beat you with that lamp? She hasn’t changed. She hits me now.” That sentence pops up a lot. She said it to my boyfriend while she was calling him over the TPO. She said it to my paternal grandmother last week, who she hasn’t spoken to in years, my dad told me the other day. “She hits me now.” 

So anyway, I get home, and put in some fish sticks for my kids to eat for dinner, and go out on the porch for a cigarette. My son is happily playing in the living room, and my mother is sitting in her chair, smoking and drinking per usual in direct eye line with the baby. Nor does she object, as this is generally something I do- use a cigarette as a timer. Only this time she decides to jump up and grab some windex and start cleaning the slider on the other side of where I’m smoking. I assume the baby is still playing by her feet. I finish my smoke and come back in, and go to grab the sticks. 

My son is in the cabinet my mother left open when she grabbed the windex, absolutely COVERED in comet. I hardline restrain every urge I have to just kill her right that second and say, as I’m wiping him clean and deciding whether to cut his shirt off with scissors, “You know he got into the cabinet and dumped out the comet, right?” And she says, “Oh, great, that’s the other half then. When you guys got arrested nobody was watching him and he dumped out the other half.” 

My brain is like- So let me get this straight. You let my son eat comet TWICE and didn’t even tell me about the first time until a month later, and are heavily insinuating that it’s my fault for daring to get strangled?? And this time I was gone less than ten minutes!!! 

So I clean him up and give him and his sister their dinner, and the night continues. Usually I wait around until my sons dad gets there to put the baby to bed, but I was ready to put him down slightly early that night. He’s a climber, and lately nothing will keep him in the crib. So if he gets out I just wait until he passes out and puts him into the crib after. So I put him in there, he almost immediately gets out, my mom makes some crack about how negligent I am for leaving him in a room with unprotected electrical sockets and I just snapped. 

“Bitch you let him eat comet twice!” “He’s not my son I don’t have to watch him!” And honestly I don’t know what else was said but I was drinking a lemonade and she grabbed my arm and it splashed on her. She started ranting about calling the cops. My daughter got scared and started crying because of what happened the last time she saw the police, and I was trying to explain to her that if the police came I would just explain to them that grandma was crazy and nothing had happened and they would go away because we were telling the truth. 

And my mother started jumping around like Gollum after he had gotten the ring away from Frodo crowing about how she just recorded that and she was going to add that to her growing library and I walked over to her and moved her hand so I could see her phone and it was on the home screen. So another lie. As I was doing this she grabbed my shirt, trying to pull it off, my breast, really hard, and turned herself into my body so it was like she was wrapped up in my arm and started saying some shit about how they told her she couldn’t do anything to me until I stole her phone, and I had just stolen her phone. Then she let go and left the house. I went outside to smoke, and my boyfriend got there about two minutes later. We sat outside for another 20 minutes or so, and then, surprise surprise, she comes back in with two cops in tow. 

One stays with her, one comes out to talk to us, he asks for my story, I tell it, he laughs and says that’s the complete opposite of what she said, I explained most of what had been going on lately and all I wanted was to go to bed, and I’m sick of her doing this shit every other day, and he starts bullshitting with my boyfriend about guy stuff. The other cop obviously fell for my moms little broken bird stomped on by the big bad cat routine and threatened me some, but they left. So I won that round. 

The next day she left early, so me and the kids had a nice day. I cleaned up some, I cooked, I reveled in not being crazy. Around 4 I got a little worried, she’s usually not gone that long, she’s a creature of routine. At about 4:30 there’s a knock on the door. I answer it and there’s a sheriffs deputy. The reason the bitch had been gone so long was because she went to the county seat and got an ex parte hearing. 

She told them a slew of lies, and a couple of half truths with no context, namely that she had attacked me first, and that paired with our respective sizes successfully got her an emergency restraining order on me, because an eviction would take too long and cost money. She’s the cheapest bitch I’ve ever met in my life. So I had ten minutes to pack up both kids and find a ride out. My boyfriend wound up sucking it all up and letting us stay, though he’s not really happy about it. We’re working on it. Things are better though. That’s another thing my mother didn’t expect. 

Fast forward, the hearing for that order was the day before yesterday. We were running late because there are several courthouses in the complex, and we had the wrong one, and of course the right one had construction in front of it so there was a long walk, so by the time we got there she was sure I wasn’t coming at all, much less with multiple witnesses to her behavior. As soon as she heard I was there, and with people, she requested a lawyer, and they reset the hearing for the 14th. Which amused the ever loving shit out of me, because shouldn’t I be the one getting a lawyer? 

Anyway, I was riding high that day, when I should have been preparing. I won that round as well, and she hates losing. So after court she took her bitter ass right across the street to job and family services and told the child protective people god knows what. I got a phone call yesterday around 3:30, saying they had received a report concerning the incident between me and my boyfriend back in April. The one that started all of this. 

They asked if they could come visit as an alternative response case and we made an appointment for 10:30 today. We hung up. Less than two minutes later they call me back with some crazy story about whoops! Actually we’ve been trying to get ahold of you for four days (which is absolute bullshit, my phone has been on, and if they tried to call me I would have gotten the call) and if we don’t make contact with you today we have to put in the file that we had to make multiple attempts, which looks bad for you. (Which was my second clue it wasn’t alt response, my first was the last time I had one, they said the next time a call was made for any reason a real case would be opened and my mother knew this) so I said sure, come on out, and we had about 45 minutes to prepare.  I also know they have 72 hours to make first contact. That’s three days, not four. And four days before they called me was Sunday. I’m not a fucking idiot. 

They get here, and there’s two of them, one of whom is a supervisor(clues three and four they want my kids) and they start by asking a few questions about the incident, but then they start asking “routine” questions that are definitely not routine, as I’ve been through this before. But I played along. And then they wanted to talk to my daughter alone, which they did for about a half hour on the porch, and I overheard some through the window and they debated whether my son was old enough to interview in any way, and then they started asking my daughter questions about her bathing suit places, and whether anyone ever touched her there besides me. Specifically my boyfriend. 

This bitch accused my boyfriend of molesting BOTH my children. My boyfriend is a sexual abuse survivor himself. And so am I. I am beyond livid. She did this specifically to discredit him as a witness for me. And if she got my kids taken from me so be it. She doesn’t even want them. She spent so much time talking about how she wants them and would be so much better for them but she definitely doesn’t want my son and doesn’t care if she hurts him, and actively emotionally abuses my daughter. 

Since we’ve been away from her my daughters night terrors have completely stopped, her bed wetting has almost stopped, and she doesn’t hold her bowels as often. They asked me if there were any credible threats against me or my children and I told them my mother. 

So if anyone has any advice here, I’d really love to hear it, because I don’t know what the hell to do. Nothing she’s doing is credible, but I don’t have the money to defend myself other than words. And she’s trying to wear me down so hard. No lawyer, the only hard evidence I have is reddit posts, and my witnesses, and she’s gone out of her way to stack up so much legal bullshit I don’t know how I’ll get out of it without a lawyer. Civil cases don’t qualify for a public defender. I’m so tired.


Quick edit: she called my boyfriend just now (like 20 minutes ago, 12 hours after this was initially posted)to tell him I have mail and to tell him if he needs a break she’s more than happy to watch the kids- in reality she was checking to see If CPS had shown up yet.",JUSTNOMIL
"I mentioned in the comments on my previous post a little bit about how my talk with JB went, but I'll update here as more shenanigans have gone down. I told her and FIL that I appreciate their help immensely, but would like to do our (my girls and my) laundry myself and would also appreciate it if they let me unload the dishwasher since I know where it all is supposed to go. JB started crying and said she never wanted to make my life difficult while she was here and that she just wanted to help me out because I never get any help (um, what about your son??). She just wanted me to be able to relax, blah blah blah. I also mentioned that my bedroom/bathroom should be off limits which JB was fine with, it was FIL that had a fit over it but that's a story for a different sub. I have been shutting my door and locking it. All has been good there.

That next day after our talk, JB hurt her foot somehow while she was outside with the girls. It looks pretty damn nasty but she bruises easily. Her whole foot is black and blue and she's not able to move her toes up (says it hurts her to do that but walking on it is fine). She refuses to go to the hospital to get it checked out. So enter ""I don't know if we can leave on Friday. I don't think I'll be able to put on my boots to ride my motorcycle up to NY"". They aren't allowed to stay past Saturday, they'll need to find a hotel at that point.

Cue random boundary stomping. I have this Starbucks reusable cup that I usually put my water in. I had filled it up and around the morning snack time had been using it in plain sight of JB while we were sitting at the table. I went with FIL to pick up her bike from the Harley shop (needed something serviced) and when I came back it was no where to be found. I searched everywhere thinking I must have misplaced it. A little while later I go outside to see what they are doing and see it's been tossed over the fence into our neighbors yard. Great. She blamed it on my youngest. I had to go to the neighbors house to ask them to get it for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Next up we have moving of the dining room furniture. My youngest is still in a high chair because otherwise she just wants to run around and doesn't want to eat her food. We have an Ikea cheapy table with chairs on one side, a bench on the other. JB took it upon herself to move the bench by herself (with her foot messed up) to the other side and move LO's high chair so that she could see the tv while eating. I had just had a talk with her about how I didn't want her watching tv while she ate, that she needed to focus on her food because she's been having poor weight gain. Needless to say, it got changed back real quick. 

&amp;#x200B;

JB has also been having withdrawal symptoms. She ran out of her Vicodin (refill hasn't come in yet) and has been shaking like crazy. To deal with her pain (her spine is fusing near her neck apparently) she's been drinking. I have a bottle of Tequila in the fridge because we made margaritas a few weeks back. She had half a glass filled with Tequila and was just drinking it straight up. Told her she couldn't watch the girls if she's drinking and she went into the basement (guest bed is there) and sulked all day.

I am absolutely ready for them to leave. Told DH that he is never to leave the state while they are visiting again.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi ! So not sure if some of you remember but my mom is the one who kicked me while I was holding the baby and later, threw my SO’s suicide attempt in his face. It’s been around 7 weeks now. With low contact and she has seen my DD once. 
The 1st Incident: I went over to my moms. My dad said they had started therapy. And they wanted to apologize. I went over. I recorded the conversation because my mom flips a lot. The biggest takeaways were; she’s happy she threw SO’s suicide attempt in his face. She wanted to hurt him. She was abused and assaulted by SO and his Brother. When I pressed her for a definition of that it’s because they said “that’s how you treat your daughter?” (But the Abuse I suffered for 22 years isn’t abuse... Got it) She is now saying that she never even kicked me and she NEVER said she jackknifed me. I reminded her I have recordings of the conversations- she said that she didn’t care. 

When I told her that if she didn’t apologize we couldn’t have a relationship. She said “why does this affect us and DD.?” 
“SO is DD father mom. When you insult him you are insulting DD.” 

“Well I’m DDS GRANDMA! DDS FATHER SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT BEFORE HE BROKE MY HEART. NEVER FORGET THAT I LET HIM IN THE ROOM AND NO ONE NOT EVEN YOU CAN HAVE THAT. I LOST YOU THE DAY YOU WERE RAPED AND SO I DONT WANT YOU NOW.“ 

This is when I realized my mother has officially fucking lost it. And I started sobbing and went to leave. 

The 2nd incident: I got a call from my mom and in a rush of guilt-answered. The voice was sickly sweet so I knew something was up. 
“Hi babe ! We were emptying out your old room. We have lives to get to you know. And we found these naked pictures of you. First of all you have a beautiful body. This has prompted me to bring up an issue that I know you’ll get mad at me for. But I don’t care I’m your mom and I care about you and I have the right to tell you what to do. And I think that this is harming my GRANDBABY” 

“That’s a lot of shit to process mom but go ahead.” 

My lovely controlling mother then starts screaming at me. 
“SOME ONE SAID ON INSTAGRAM THAT YOU ARE POSTING PICTURES OF YOU BREASTFEEDING AND I JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT IS INAPPROPRIATE AND I AM 100 PERCENT AGAINST IT.” 

I hung up. 1. I don’t need to explain myself. 2. I don’t need to explain myself. 

Then came the bombarding texts. Walls and walls of how I’m going to lose the baby because of my immaturity. 

Then finally, a picture text. A picture of the “nudes” and a text saying “we will be using these and anything else we have to to protect DD from your vile way of life. You are sick and we have more than enough proof.” 

I’m shaking. And I have been shaking since that text. I am furious. And I am scared. In California it appears Grandparents don’t have rights. Can anyone confirm this for me ? But also what if she calls CPS. I’m just so upset. 

I think it should be okay because even though in California recordings aren’t admissible in court. They aren’t illegal so I can show CPS. ... I hope.",JUSTNOMIL
"This bitch. 

THIS BITCH. 

Recap:OPLS is my mom. Currently living with her as we save up for a home (good luck vibes needed, trying to qualify for a home loan this week to gtfo)

Scene: my hubby at work. My dad at his local interest club that's always Thursday nights. It's me, OLPS, my 5yo, and younger sister (with whom my daughter has almost as strong a relationship as with me and hubby- they have an extra special connection)

OLPS is in the formal living room listening to music.  Ys is upstairs fucking around. It's bedtime for my 5yo. She's 5 and idefk mercury is in retro grade or some shit because she's been a HANDFUL the last few days. I'm sure it's just a phase but she's openly defiant, testing boundaries, unusually rude and misbehaving the past week or so. 

Tonight at bedtime her toys were still strewn about. I had a confrontation/ meltdown with her about cleaning up her toys (as we require every night) before going down to bed. She was having a tantrum. 

I was standing clear in my mommy boundaries: Clean up your mess or else you don't get a bedtime story. 

Suddenly OLPS is in the room, crawling on her hands and knees to pick up the fucking legos. ""It's ok WeeOne, you'll get your story. ""

I told OLPS to STOP NOW.  I'M the mom. MY boundaries and requirements matter

OLPS says,  ""she's just so upset""

Me: ""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING WHEN I WAS YOUNGER THAN HER YOU WERE BEATING MY SISTERS WITH A BELT FOR NOT CLEANING THEIR ROOM FAST ENOUGH""

OLPS: ""That never happened.  I never beat you with a belt. ""

Me: ""LITERALLY MY FIRST MEMORY IS HIDING BEHIND A DRESSER THANKFUL I WASN'T 5YO BECAUSE THAT WAS OLD ENOUGH TO BE SPANKED WITH A BELT AS A LISTENED TO YOU BEAT MY  OLDER SISTERS WITH A BELT IN THE NEXT ROOM""

OLPS: That never happened lol



Just... really? That's a memory I've carried for 25 years. Also the memory of my mom requiring my 16yo sister to *hold me down on the stairs while she spanked me sixteen times because that's how many times I talked back*

Also, at least three times she slapped me across the face so hard i ended up with a bloody nose. Before I was sixteen. 

By the time I was sixteen I knew that the law didn't require me to attend school so I started threatening her with dropping out if she hit me again. 


But yeah bitch. Undermine me. Undermine my efforts to NOT PHYSICALLY ABUSE MY CHILD.  Deny that you ever physically abused me, oh, lol, didn't happen. JUST BECAUSE YOU WERE TOO DRUNK TO REMEMBER DOESN'T MEAN YOU DIDN'T BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF ME. 


WHY would I have a memory of ""5yo is the start of being old enough to being beat with a belt"" ....*if your drunk ass never beat me with a belt* ????",JUSTNOMIL
"Prep was not fun for my colonoscopy. Luckily I was able to be put under for the procedure. It took 3x longer than a normal one.

I got some scary results and now a 2 week wait for the results of all of the biopsies. 

When we got back fo the house, I went to bed. I was exhausted and in some pain, I needed sleep.

When I got up a few hours later, I heard her talking to my FIL. 

""She just did it to get attention. There's nothing wrong with her.""

She was talking about me. I kept to myself. I didn't even tell them I was having the colonoscopy done. Only she knew I was getting ready because she saw I couldnt eat and loved rubbing that in my face. After I took the first dose of prep, I kept to myself in my room/bathroom so I didn't get in their way with my misery.

So why does she think I did it for attention?!

I've only hared my results with my husband, mom and best friend. I would never share them with her so she could somehow torture me with it. I'm just emotionally exhausted today.",JUSTNOMIL
"LO's baptism is this weekend and I'm feeling a bit anxious bc I haven't seen JNMIL since they were here for 7 weeks after LO's birth. Thanks to the advice and support of this community, I know I can make it through this weekend without losing my shit. 

They live out of state and I last spoke with JNMIL 3 months ago when I called her to tell her stop the guilt trips and unreasonable demands on our time. She tried to rug sweep and love bomb, but I've maintained limited contact with her. Anyway, DH and I told them to limit this trip to 2-3 days, but they booked a 5-day trip anyway. No surprise there bc they are entitled boundary stompers. They're staying in a hotel, but I'm sure they'll find some dumb excuse to try to come over to our house everyday. Spoiler: DH and I agreed on boundaries, including the boundary that JNMIL and FIL can only come to our house for the baptism party AND that they only get to see LO for 2 days of their trip.

Thankfully some of my JYFamily is flying in for the baptism. I initially didn't think they'd be able to come, but DH reached out to them and talked them into it bc he knew it was important to me. (Major props to DH!) DH also agreed that my family has priority to see LO since they've had hardly any time with him. JNMIL is very jealous when other people get to spend time with LO, so she'll likely try to weasel her way into our plans under the guise of wanting us all to spend time together. I'm not caving. Anyway, wish me luck. I'll post an update after this weekend.",JUSTNOMIL
"The bot will remind you of the first time I noticed MIL is actually an evil stepmother -- and things have escalated since then. DH has been VLC with her, and her attention has turned to her own marriage -- fighting for her husband, against her stepson. Yup. She sees her stepson the same way she sees me -- as someone who's stealing her men. As she escalated SFIL has been calling us with sobbing breakdowns and we are able to get some glimpse of the story. We are now so numb from it all...

&amp;#x200B;

As with all family dramas Christmas is a busy time of the year. On Christmas Eve, SFIL gets home, says, let's all go out together. MIL says: no, either we go out alone, or you and your son can go out together and I stay at home. Why? Because stepson has special needs and is ""embarrassing to be seen in public"".

&amp;#x200B;

SFIL is a bit of enabler as well, in our opinion, because this is not the first time she's asked him to choose. SFIL tells us that she has separate cutleries &amp; plates for stepson, because she thinks stepson is a pig and disgusting. MIL refuses to ride in the same car as stepson, so SFIL have to do two pickup runs every evening -- picks up MIL from work, go back home, then go to stepson's school and pick him up. Get the order wrong and it's war. DH and I both think this is unacceptable but we can't really say anything as we only found out after this has become a habit (they live overseas).

&amp;#x200B;

Due to MIL's drama, no one went out on Christmas Eve and they stayed at home shouting at each other. On Christmas Day, SFIL takes son for an errand early in the morning. MIL wakes up to find them both gone and goes BERSERK. She tore down all the Christmas decorations and wailed to all the neighbours that it's not real Christmas if it's not spent with family -- and stepson, who is adopted, is not family.

&amp;#x200B;

MIL then says to DH: ""Baby you have no idea how it is, when I'm alone with SFIL everything is fine, and when stepson is at home, finish! I don't exist in SFIL's dictionary anymore!"" 😂😂😂

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly don't remember how the drama tapered off, there was so much shouting... went on for days. But I do remember that is when I decided this evil crazy bitch needs to be kept as far from our family as we can, because you can tell a lot about a person by looking at how they treat someone else less their size.

&amp;#x200B;

\--

EDIT:

Some context - SFIL and MIL live overseas in a country where child protection is not a thing, nor is calling the cops on behaviour like this. We don't know how we can help (MIL is fighting a war with us as well, so in all honesty we are also exhausted). Why SFIL haven't kicked her out is beyond both DH and me.

&amp;#x200B;

\--

&amp;#x200B;

Some collective replies: 

&amp;#x200B;

\- SBIL is 16. Due to his special condition he's less mature than kids that age though. He does fight back and give MIL hell but that only exacerbate the problem in the long run -- cue MIL victimising herself and heavy drama.

\- There is literally nothing we can do: please do understand and take our word for it. I can't explain why without basically completely exposing everyone in RL but believe me when I say I understand 100% the concerns everyone raised, but these ideas do not permeate to every corner in the world. That's why I posted it here because I know everyone here understands why we think this is fucked up -- not everyone there does. 

\- We have tried to explain &amp; intervene on a personal level by telling MIL everything everyone has said -- love is not a zero sum game etc etc, no use. She applies the same logic to the kid as to me -- we are all there to steal her men. 

\- The reason SFIL doesn't kick her out is because SFIL can't bring himself to do it -- MIL depends on SFIL in RL for visa &amp; livelihood as well. SFIL is enabling, but he is also depressed &amp; tortured &amp; a victim. He has lost 30kg since I last saw him and I honestly don't know what can be done. Their whole family is held together by emotional/verbal abuse and SFIL is running himself haggard trying to keep his son &amp; wife separate so he can make both happy. I'm not saying this is right -- I'm only saying we can't change him. 

\- SFIL has said MIL needs psychiatric attention many times but that's not a thing in their country either -- no welfare checks, or compulsory checking someone in, etc. 

\- SBIL is adopted, and I don't know how involved SFIL's ex-wife is in the kid's life. As I've said we are VLC with them (the only little contact we have is when MIL flies off her handle at us, instead of the son). 

&amp;#x200B;

\--

I understand this is a disturbing topic but please reserve your judgement and demands for action because not everyone has the same agency as those who live in a country with the right kind of cultural attitudes &amp; institutional support. We have already tried our best -- years ago. Nothing has worked, and if anything, it only dragged us into a bigger war on top of the one MIL was fighting with us. We are so fucking exhausted -- MIL is like a blackhole that thrives on drama &amp; attention wherever she can get it. I'm sorry but we have to put our own welfare first.",JUSTNOMIL
"So about 3-4 weeks ago I was on here posting about my fFIL refusing to come to our wedding because fMIL had a 10+ year old restraining order against him. At first, my fiancee was going to go in guns blazing to get his mom to drop it. But I took some of the advice on here and cautioned him to tread lightly because the more attacked she feels, the lesser she'll want to do it and more likely she could somehow get him in legal trouble for coercion. 

&amp;#x200B;

So he took my advice and had lunch with her and more casually brought up that his dad won't come to the wedding because of her restraining order. Eventually SHE was the one that suggested she drop it and so he said he'd go with her ""for support"" (ie. make sure it actually happens). She ended up canceling twice and my fiancee was getting scared she was just blowing smoke up his butt to get him to think well of her. Well, FINALLY 2 days ago he took her to the courthouse and after a very brief interview the judge dropped the restraining order. 

&amp;#x200B;

So he brings the good news to his dad, sends up the paperwork. He says ""that's great! But we need to have a serious talk"". As you may recall, in another previous post my fiancee's stepmother refused to come to our wedding because he never went to his stepbrother's funeral who he never really knew. Well, she insisted that my fiancee's dad ""set the record straight"". Mind you, she sent her spineless husband to do this for her and didn't even bother to say this to him herself.

&amp;#x200B;

She said she's not coming to the wedding because ""if you can't be bothered to ever come here, why should I go there? If you don't want to be part our family, I don't want to be part of yours."" I was enraged when he told me this! Are you freakin kidding me? His dad literally left him behind in another state to go play house with a new family half way across the country. Never ever paid for him to come visit, even when he was 15 and made him homeless at one point and he had to stay with his best friend's family. I was so pissed she could have the balls to say something like that but my fiancee just shrugged. He's use to it, this is always how she is. I told him that if it were me I wouldn't have held back on putting her in her place.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to say something, but my fiancee is very not confrontational and has asked me to trust him and stay out of it. So for now, I am just going to sit quietly but if his dad says a word about this whole thing in my presence, I will shut that shit down.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi again everyone. My (24F) boyfriend (25M) and I have been having serious issues lately. Backstory, my FMIL is very financially abusive and has taken 10k from him over the last 1.5 years.

Anyway, he plans to send her an email next week cutting her out of his life (finally!).

The remaining issue is this. Last year sometime, he bought her a car. I'm extremely angry he did this, but it's done.

It's her car basically - she drives it every day; he's never touched it or used it. It's in his name though and he pays $400 on it every month for her. I think she pays the insurance, like $150 per month, but whatever. He owns and pays for it but she uses it. Yep.

We talked about how he needs to sell it instead of paying $400 a month to her for it. A financial counselor told him he should too.

But he keeps saying that if he sells ""her"" car, she won't be able to get to work and then she'll lose her job and then she'll lose her house blah blah blah.

He's paying for her car every month and has like 20k left to pay on it and doesn't want to sell it because he thinks it will destroy her.

She told him that she will ""go into bankruptcy"" if he stops paying it.

She makes 70k a year and blows it all away on food, alcohol, subscriptions.

"Thank you so much guys for all your support on my last post, I was in my dr clinic today for my poor daughter who has a nasty ear infection and I ended up speaking to the receptionist who originally took Dr Demento's call. She said she was so convincing the ph call lasted 40 minutes!! 40 minutes of her bullshit and lies to this poor receptionist.

But it gets better, before her lengthy ph call apparently she also sent them a lengthy email in regards to my mental state and how she was so concerned for the children's welfare. After talking to the receptionist and then the clinics manager they are happy to hand me copies of the email she sent plus notes made during the ph call. Because Dr Demento isn't a patient they have no duty towards her. So my Dr will be releasing all of this to me tomorrow and I'll be adding it to my stash.",JUSTNOMIL
"I didn’t think I would be here again considering how much I try to avoid my husbands family. And yet, here I am.

My 1 year old just had his birthday on the 3rd and we had planned a small get together with close friends and my side of the family at my moms house on this coming up weekend. Max like 10 people, and it’s mostly because they’re not from here and don’t see him often. They’re all wonderful and mostly JustYes.  Note: my extended family is all above 70, I am the only one in my family that is in their mid 20’s so this is kind of a big deal that they’re able to be here for him. 

My jnmil somehow got wind that this was happening and texts DH asking why we’re mad at her (probably from DH’s bio siblings we invited as mil is his adoptive mom. Fun fact: she calls DH her adopted son and her bio son, her son when she introduces him). Mind you, I made an event on Facebook for this about a month ago. She had a whole month to know and stew about this. 

https://imgur.com/a/BWaroWp

This is also the woman that: 

-Barged into my delivery room two days pp after we explicitly stated multiple times NO visitors. She also stared at my chest while I pumped when she barged in.

-When she and her husband visited us at our new house, took my 3 month old son and walked around with him saying “tell me how they treat you” for two hours while she made her husband take pictures of him (without asking) and then forced my DH to interrupt me nursing him so that she could say goodbye. At the time she worked for DCFS so her comments were so inappropriate. 

-Refused to hand me back my 6 month old son who had started crying for me and I had to put my hands on her to get him back. And her husband got pissy and defensive when we asked him not to take our son’s toys out of the packaging at our makeup Christmas in the middle of a crowded restaurant. 

She does not try to be involved, only sends a guilt trip text every ~3 months about how she never sees DS. Doesn’t ask to see him (or us) outside of Christmas and Thanksgiving and even then it’s just to strike her ego when no one wants to be there anyway. Seriously. I’ve never been to a more awkward family function, you could cut the tension with a butter knife. 

Ugh, she makes my skin crawl and it doesn’t help that her house is borderline hoarders. DH and I both agreed that DS will never see the inside of that house. I just want to go full mama bear mode and tell her to fuck off a cliff but DH is making me stay quiet and just ignore her because he doesn’t want to deal with her right now.",JUSTNOMIL

FDH said, “Oh, I have a horrible thought, but I’m going to say it. Next time they call you, just tell them to hurry up and die. It’ll solve all our problems. You won’t have to deal with them AND we get money.”

"This new year, my DH’s family is planning to go on a 3-4day vacation. I’ve already been to last year’s. It was manageable because DH was attentive to me and never let me alone with JNMIL and JNSIL or their FM. 

However, I’d still prefer not to spend time with them because 
- they make me feel hurt and bitter (because I only found out they picked on me behind my back after years of my being genuine to them)
- they make me feel scared and wary (because they always eavesdrop on my Dh and I or observe us/me to make mental notes of what to attack me with at a later time)
- they are exceedingly warm and welcoming to me in front of others so nobody really knows the JN about them, so if I respond with reduced enthusiasm, they can easily paint me as rude/ungrateful etc later to the Flying Monkeys. Or worse, to my DH. This means I have to be cordial throughout those days 24/7 since we will stay together at a resort, and it makes me feel as fake as they are. It’s torturous. 
- they will either make us pay for our expenses (I don’t want to pay for something that I didn’t want), or not make us pay but later use it as a point to show how generous and loving of a mil she is to me. something like “I treat OP like my OWN DAUGHTER. No, EVEN better. 😘😘I never ask for them to pay me...the trips are my gift to them...” to her FMs. 

To DH another day, “(a continuation and reiteration of how well she treats me by giving me things I never asked for and only accepted so as to not offend her) ...but OP won’t even do any house chores even though she LIVES here!” (FYI I used to do them, but since learning that she never acknowledged them and still made this accusation to my DH, I’ve washed my hands off all chores except boiling hot water some months back) 

So. those are the cons.

But the pros of going is that my DH will not have to be with them alone. He loves them, of course, but he also finds it frustrating to be around them. So my going would be a huge support for him. 
In our own pockets of time during the trip, we will be able to find our own fun so it wouldn’t be too bad. 
He was thankful for my presence on last year’s trip. and also, I don’t know if the JNs will have more chances to FOG him during the trip if I am not around? 
they seem to complain the most about me to DH when I am not around (when I am, they play that ‘Bestest MIL/SIL’ skit). I worry that hearing something often enough will make him start to believe it. 
or that he will feel abandoned by me if I don’t go. 

Are we supposed to show up as a strong team all the time? Is my not-going an opening in my defenses? 

it contradicts with my desire to be VLC despite me living with them right now. 

advice please? 

TLDR; to be VLC, or to show up with DH for visits as a Team?",JUSTNOMIL
"So this happened about a week ago but I feel a bit of a need to rant about it now and I guess make sure I'm not overreacting. 

The day after the incident, she texted me asking if I was okay and it somehow devolved into another fight. 

I'll reproduce the batshittery here, and I think the way I'll format it is to put her messages in quote blocks (hopefully that doesn't turn out ugly), mine unquoted, and my thoughts **[bolded in brackets.]** Hopefully that makes things easy to read.

-----

&gt; Are you okay?

Yes, I'm fine.

&gt; I'm so sorry things turned out like that. I wish I could do something to make everything right for you and that you were not afraid of me. I am truly sorry for that. I don't know what to do.

I think the best thing you can do right now is give me space. I'm not asking you to never talk to me again, but I just can't talk about this so soon. It may be a long time until I'm ready to handle it, but for now I just want to be able to traverse the house without fear of anything similar happening, and I want space to be able to process things.

&gt; Do you want me to leave the house? I'm not sure what you're asking me to do here. **[Have you no reading comprehension? Didn't I literally just tell you what I wanted you to do?]**

I don't think that will be necessary. I just don't want you to yell at me or ask me about the situation if I'm downstairs.

&gt; You got in that car last night with an attitude. **[???]** You purposely did this. **[?????]** You have used me since the whole ""I hate you, Happy Mother's Day"" episode. **[Okay no back off, I literally never used the words ""I hate you,"" I only said I was afraid of you. And wow gee, thanks for throwing mother's day in my face a-fucking-gain. YOU asked the fucking question and I answered and somehow that's my fault, and you've been throwing it in my face for a year now every time you get pissy at me. Thanks.]** I have tried and tried and you will not give me an inch of forgiveness or a shred of common courtesy that you would give to a stranger. You say you are terrified of me but I have never laid a hand on you. **[You never needed to hit me, your words and actions hurt enough. Emotional abuse is an actual thing and to act like I have no reason to be afraid of you because you've never hit me is exceedingly ignorant.]** You tell me how absolutely awful I am but you don't give me the time of day. **[Have you ever stopped to ask yourself WHY that is?]**

&gt; I don't need any more talk with you. I have never in my life harmed you. **[OH FUCKING REALLY?]** I have only tried to help you and you have only ever hurt me. Cruelly and purposefully. **[You always accuse me of treating you like shit and hurting you but I have never in my life been purposely rude to you. Everything has to be about you. Who gives a fuck about how you've hurt me, nooooo, it's all about *you* and how hurt *you* are. Jesus christ.]**

&gt; I'm not going to move out Dovah. It's my house.

You didn't know what you could do. I tried to tell you. All I said was that I didn't want to talk about this immediately and I didn't want you to ask me about it. It's Aunt's house **[she bought it and my mom and housemate pay rent on it, I wasn't trying to be snarky, it just literally isn't my mom's house so she can't make that claim.]**, but I never told you to move out. You asked me if I wanted you to. I said that probably wouldn't be necessary.

And yes, you have harmed me. You don't need to raise a hand against me to hurt me. What you do in your words and actions hurts plenty.

&gt; Fine. It's Aunt's house. So I'm being put out because I yelled at you??? **[When did I ever say that? I said nothing of the sort. You're extrapolating wild things in whatever insane reality you make up in your fucking head.]** You girls have it all worked out do you? **[Hahahaha yeah because my source of support who's also been abused by you is conspiring against you with me.]**

I literally never said anything about you moving out.

&gt; Dovah. Sincerely only texted to see if you were ok. I had no intention of starting another fight. **[Well you did and HERE WE FUCKING ARE.]**

&gt; Honey I hope when you are ready you will give me 5 minutes of your time so I can speak my peace and go. I promise I will not raise my voice. I will keep my hands in my pockets. I just want to speak face to face with you. Is there no memory in our past that would lead you to believe I am worthy of five more minutes of your time? Do you not have one good memory of time we shared? **[No actually, I don't. And I appreciate the guilt trip. No, I have very very few good memories of you, and they're all overshadowed by the constant fear and pain I felt around you in my teens.]**

There's nothing wrong with wanting to talk to me and I understand that, but it may be some time before I'm ready.

&gt; I guess that's it then. I will wait to hear from you.

Thank you. I will eventually talk about it when I feel ready to. Until then I just want us to get along peacefully.

-----

The issue I'm having now is, after what she did to me that Tuesday night and then everything she flung at me in this fight we had the following Wednesday...I've been feeling like I don't want to give her any more chances. I don't want to try anymore. Shit, the only reason I even tried to reconcile in the first place was because when Aunt found out I was planning to move out and never look back after graduating, she said I couldn't live under Old Yeller's roof or expect/accept a car from her if I didn't want a relationship with her and that I was using her. I felt pressured into fixing our awful relationship.

Now? I feel like I don't want to keep Old Yeller in my life if this is how she's going to treat me. That night and the text fight we had the day after showed me that:

* She only cares about herself and will put her emotional wants and having her fee-fees catered to above my needs (as shown by her camping outside my bedroom and refusing to leave despite me repeatedly telling her I needed to be alone and eventually having a panic attack and crying in my closet).

* She seems to see me as a slot machine, given how she kept acting like she's been trying so hard and I'm being hateful for no reason. She acts like I should have spat out a payout by now and that's not how this fucking works.

* She's fucking selfish and everything has to be about her all the time. She needs to get her way every time or there will be hell to pay and one hell of a tantrum.

I don't want someone like that in my life if they're going to treat me that way and act like that. I've seen so many people give the advice ""when they show you who they are, believe them."" I feel like that's what happened here and that she's *been* showing me this my entire life, but I've kept giving her chances and not seeing it.

Fast forward a bit to Monday evening, a couple days ago. She picked me up from work and after I get in the car she goes ""are you feeling okay to be around me?"" Then on the way home she says ""I know you said we weren't going to talk about it until you were ready **[Then why the fuck are you bringing it up right now?? You're literally doing the opposite of that.]**, but I just wanted to say that I am truly sorry. I didn't know I was doing that to you, and I'll spend the rest of my days making sure it never happens again **[...Oh. That went differently than I expected.]**""

Seriously? Almost a week after the fact and now she has self-awareness? NOW she's trying? How about, I don't know, *any fucking point in the last 20 years?* It pisses me off and saddens me to see her acting like this now because I just feel like it's too late. She can say and do whatever she wants to be nice to me but I know what she's capable of and I've just about made up my mind.

It's like, stop being self aware. You had the last 20 years to clean up your fucking act and you choose now, after the biggest fight we've ever had. Now, after I've 90% made up my mind to give up on you, stop giving you chances, and never look back after I finally get away from you.

It's making my resolve waver just a little bit. And I want to ask a community that *gets* it--am I being too harsh? I feel like this is what I want and this is the right thing for me to do for myself, but...at the same time she seems to be showing remorse and I feel bad that I'm about ready to give up on her and cut ties completely after I move.

It's just a weird feeling and I'm a bit conflicted.",JUSTNOMIL
"Our lines of communication have been open but she has been kept on a strict info diet. I have dodged her trying to gift us more things we do not want nor picked for LO-- i.e. we sooo do not want that recently recalled baby item that wasnt even on our radar before the recall, stop trying to push it on us, MIL. I have 7 unread texts from her over the last few days. Every day she asks how I am feeling and when I did respond I am great and feeling awesome, I get her sob story about her pregnancy with SIL1... oh, I forgot... everything is really about you, MiMi! You don't actually care how I feel, you just want an opening to discuss yourself! Bitch isnt even on read, just straight ignore.  DH also does not reply or read her messages and he knows he needs to set the record straight on everything as MIL and FIL are acting like everything is magically fixed bc we are having a baby. Also, they both keep telling us she hasnt been drinking... for like a month. I just wish we were back at NC...

Yesterday, DH had a no good rotten day. It started on his way to work when he was trying to hash out in a non emotional manner what he wants to say to FIL and MIL and he ended up in tears. The hurt of being treated differently and that his mom has said his BIO family wanted nothing to do with him just kills him. Yes, he knows he is creating his own family, but as we all know that shit stings and hurts. And that hovered over him all day like a cloud. When he got home, we just snuggled and cuddled. I wish I could protect him from those thoughts and also slap some empathy into his parents on how their behavior is unacceptable.

SIL1 and her DH will be driving down in her new to her Christmas present car for her birthday next week because the only time SIL1 shows up is when she's  bound to get something or to deliver some not legal in our state greens but we should go over and entertain the ILs all the time....and MIL wants us to come over to BBQ out on Sunday and give me the 200 newborn diapers she bought for us and wrapped... ""SIL1's birthday and a baby shower!!"" Next Sunday is father's day... no mention of it. Poor FIL. We do not want to be at their home. We refuse. Someplace public? Okay. Not private. Never. 

MIL has delusions of grandma in her head with buying a pack and play for her home and buying the 200 diapers to take 10 out for herself/ the pack and play as if I will be traveling anywhere with a newborn but especially to their home where less than a year ago she threatened to shoot FIL. Did I mention I live in an area that just experienced a tragedy involving gun workplace violence? Oh, MIL has also purchased LOs Christmas presents: the Fischer Price Telephone, that push mower type thing with the balls inside that pop, and a doll house. The doll house will stay at her house because that's what you do with gifts to other people, you keep them as leverage. Does she not realize we can see right through all this as a way to try and have the kid over at her house and to make us the ""bad guys"" for not bringing over LO? Does she not realize most of those gifts aren't age appropriate for a 3 month old? 

She'll be invited to the baby shower and we are going no gifts. She'll more than likely act like a stick is up her ass and everyone needs to fawn over her and when she does not get that attention will sulk. I told my mom this. My mom said she will not engage. Shower will be at a public space as our home and my mother's home are off limits to MIL. 

While I enjoy losing my shit and raging out like the hulk, I realize emotional reactions allow MIL to become the victim. The goal is to point that out everytime I feel the fire burning inside and tell her it will not work as a means to deflect and then we will remove ourselves from the situation ASAP. We will not take excuses, we will not rug sweep, we will NOT pretend everything is different when it is the same shit different day. And if people want to act like fucking toddlers we will treat them as such with timeouts. Being a grandparent is a privilege not a right and if they want that privilege we need real change of rehab and therapy not ""I'm not drinking!"" At this moment and on some new antianxiety medication when the real issues are so deep. 

I guess this is just a rant and vent. But I miss NC and not having her take up real estate in my head. And any advice for having the talk with FIL and MIL will be greatly appreciated because I honestly think they are so use to rug sweeping they don't understand we are not doing that and things are not fixed nor will ever be without some serious changes.

"Hey, new poster about my own JNM but I’ve commented a few times. So kind of a new user I guess. Either way TLC is definitely needed. 

So I’ve recently been in hospital, I’ve not been eating much since I got out. I have a severe chronic pain condition that is pretty debilitating. I’ve also recently lost my job. So not having a great time. I live with my JNM and her very very JNBF (just no boyfriend??) 

Tonight she absolutely blew up. Uncontrollably so. I’m not proud of my reaction. I took her bait and was horrible back. But this woman knows exactly how to push my buttons. 

On and on and on. It’s all about how I sponge off her, I’m a leach, no one loves me, I’ll never amount to anything. Very classic JN behaviour. But then, she realises that I’ve taken a couple of those small bags of haribo. The ones for little kids. I explain it was because I’ve been feeling unwell since they swapped my pain meds and she erupted again. I’m fat and lazy, how dare I take something that isn’t mine. If I want to eat I need to buy it myself. Then it was oh haha you can’t because you don’t have a job. Followed by, if you didn’t pay for it you are not allowed to eat anything in this house!!! 

I also lost it and just screamed at her. I said everything I could to hurt her. I’m not proud of this and it’s very out of character. I’m just at the end of my rope with this hideous bitch. 

I can’t stand being near her or her toxic bf. I’m so upset. I’m angry at myself and her. I just want to cry. If I could move out I would.


Edit - 

Apparently this isn’t clear. Although I lost my job, I still financially contribute to the household. Everything in the house (other than them decorating or buying themselves a tv) is split fairly. I contribute to the food and bills. So the food in the house is just as much mine as it is theirs.",JUSTNOMIL
"I told DH that when the baby comes, I want LC with JNMIL. She has become a constant thorn in my side despite having been nice to her in the past and her taking advantage of my kindness (I've mentioned this on a previous post).

Anyways, when I told DH I wanted LC with JNMIL, he got really upset with me because he said I'm cheating my kids out of having grandparents. This isn't some idea I came up with willy-nilly. So let me explain why I want LC:

JNMILis insanely controlling (to the point where FIL even said to me and DH that she has got to learn to let go).

She has offered for DH to move BACK IN WITH HER, in front of me, his 7 months pregnant wife. 

She constantly pushes FIL away from us and when he tries to have a conversation with us, she keeps on and on about how boring it is and changes the subject, even though I enjoy talking to FIL. On top of that, I'd FIL is talking, she will tell him to ""shut up"" from time to time and this infuriates me to NO END.

She pushes gender ""norms"" on me and it makes me angry. If my son wants to grow up to be a ballerina, fine with me. If I have a daughter who wants to he a mechanic, that's great! But she is constantly going on about ""women's things"" and ""men's things"" and I don't want my  children to be exposed to it.

Generally speaking, she does not listen. DH told her that I cannot eat fried food right now because I get heart burn and her response was ""yes she can."" BUT I LITERALLY CANNOT.

She keeps trying to get my husband and I to move within walking distance to her house, after we have repeatedly told her that we will not live there.

JNMIL has a JN Mother who threw away one of our son's ultrasound pictures (she stole it from her husband who was dying in hospice). She knew this before my husband went to the hospice and did not tell us, but all the aunts and uncles knew. So idk what she was thinking would happen but that was really nasty.

She tried to insert herself in when she would get to see the baby, as if she has the right to plan that out?? 

... and yet my DH will defend her actions. After I tell him all these points, he still thinks our child should be around his parents like he was with his grandparents**. I have no idea how to deal with this, honestly. I get that JNMIL is his mother and also the grandmother of our son, but I don't want to deal with the toxicity she brings. My husband are constantly fighting over her, it feels. Can any of you relate? Can any of you please tell me it will be okay?",JUSTNOMIL
"This happened about a month ago, but it is still a major factor into what's going on now and its definitely a JN story. I'll try to tl;dr it at the bottom.

As I said in past posts, DH and I live in an RV with our son (1 year old). I don't mind being a full time RVer since its cheaper living and we now have a very nice RV. In March we purchased a bigger and nicer RV than the one we had been living in for a year at that point. In order to make the payments, I had to get a job from being a stay at home mom.

I had to start working immediately so I was packing, working, and taking care of a baby that could walk and get into everything. Then once we were able to get our RVs switched out, it was a matter of unpacking everything, getting it all organized, adjusting to the new place, working, and taking care of LO. I was so discombobulated that I could barely remember my own name. It also didn't help that my work doesn't have a set schedule and since I was trying to establish myself, my schedule was all over the place. There were days I worked from 9am to 6pm. There were days that I got off at noon. I also had to pull some overnight shifts to help out.

During all this my inlaws agreed to watch my son while I worked and went to counceling (court ordered because DH's exwife got the stepkids taken away from her so DH and I have to prove to CPS we can take them in). I only worked 4 days a week and then had councelling on the 5th day. During this time I was trying to show my appreciation as best I could by thanking them constantly for watching LO. Anytime they bought anything for us I promised to repay them in some way and was always met with the same ""That's not how this family works, you'll get it back to us eventually one way or another.""

One particular week right after we switched RVs I had to work 2 night shifts in a row. I consulted my inlaws first and they said it was up to me and if I needed the extra hours it would be a good idea. So I did it because otherwise I would have only worked 2 days that week. For these days my plan was to drop off LO at about 6 or 7 at night, go get some rest and go to work at 10. Then I would get off at 8, around the time he normally wakes up (and he sleeps through the night), and take him home for the day. Yeah I would be tired, but at least inlaws would get some free time. MIL insisted that I leave LO for the day inbetween so I could get some rest. I was apprehensive, but went with it. I even went to there place gor about 4 or 5 hours on that day so they could get a break and I could see LO (this is when that ""mysterious phone call happened that was my boss asking if I was working that night from previous stories). I truly felt bad for leaving LO with them for so long.

The week following MIL says that the week before, they watched him for a total of 52 hours and didn't want to do it again. I agreed and said I would no longer work night shifts (and I haven't again). Thought it was over and done with. A couple weeks later, I needed some new glasses. I hadn't had a prescription update in about 4 years and mine were worn and broken. I scheduled an appointment the same day as my counseling in the same town (the town I got both done in is 30 minutes away) only a few hours apart from each other. I figured it was easiest to do it that way to save gas and have time inbetween to have some time to myself and get some shopping done (mostly buy LO stuff). MIL encouraged me to have time to myself. I dropped him off at their place at 9:30am and got back a little after 4pm. I even bought them groceries while there.

About a week later I went to pick up DH (he's an OTR truck driver and his terminal is about an hour away from where we live). On this day MIL plans out a dinner for all of us withour asking us if its okay. She told me about having a family dinner and she may have even told me what day she wanted it to be on, but as I said earlier, I could barely remember my own name with the state of my life in that moment. DH and I were both starving since I got off work and went straight to pick him up. We swung through a drive thru and got some food. Then on our way back I remembered that MIL wanted me to pick up something for this dinner. DH text her to ask what it was and after telling us she asks, ""Will you be joining us for dinner?"" DH is honest with her and tells her that we have eaten and just want to go home because we are both tired.

She flipped out. She sent my husband a message saying ""come get your son. I'm done with this shit."" So the rest of the way back, I am having a full blown panic attack because I relied (and sadly still do) on them for babysitting. We get there and I grab the baby and try to get out so DH can try to do damage control, but MIL says she needs to say some things to me. So I stand there awkwardly clutching my son as she screams about how I am so disrespectful and unappreciative toward them. How they spend 50+ hours every week watching the baby, they even watched him while I was out ""fucking around"" in between appointments, and I couldn't even buy them groceries without putting the receipt in the bag (I did this in case they needed to return or exchange anything). She also said that I never offered to buy them groceries or do things for them while they got us stuff all the time (things we don't want or need). 

So after her barrage of verbal abuse, I walk out with the baby and DH spends about an hour trying to talk to his mother and trying to fix things. The next day I wake up with blisters in my throat (it happens when I stess to much) and we go out to do some shopping for ourselves. DH convinced MIL to make dinner happen that night instead since it was so important to her. I stress about it all day and cannot speak and barely can eat because of the blisters. We go to there place and MIL gives me a big hug and says that she was sorry for being a bitch. All goes well that night (except for my uncontrollable shaking from being uncomfortable). I thought it was all over, but it wasn't and I will put that in Part 2.

Tl;dr- While moving, starting a new job, and being a mom without my partner physically there, MIL thinks I'm being disrespectful by taking them up on their offers to watch baby more and because I didn't offer to get them things more often.",JUSTNOMIL
"My (28f) sister (24f) is freshly out of detox as of like 18 hours ago (this is not her first attempt at sobriety, shes been attempting sobriety on &amp; off for the better part of a decade) &amp; she is back at home living with my dad (who has his own issues, to put it lightly.) She is fragile right now, obviously, &amp; one of her biggest triggers is my mom. 

Whenever my mom is in the same room as my sister, she's scanning, constantly analyzing her arms, pupils, hands, mannerisms, tone of voice, etc, over &amp; over in an attempt to sniff out if my sister is truly sober or if shes secretly high. She is relentless in her pursuit, &amp; not without good reason. 

My mom has seen the worst of my sisters addiction, having had to rush her to the ER after she overdoesed countless times. Their history has destroyed any ability my mom had to trust that my sister isnt going to turn around and run back to her vices the second my mom looks away. But my sister can feel my moms eyes scrutinizing her with every interaction &amp; knows that its a big trigger for her. 

We have both tried over &amp; over to get our mom to see that this interaction is part of the problem and that my sisters issues are just a more visible manifestation of these issues within our whole family. But she refuses to deal with her part in any of this, clinging to all of her justifications that explain why she's so anxious &amp; unable to trust my sister anymore. She wont take responsibility for her part in our family's issues all while demanding that my sister take responsibility &amp; change her shit. Its infuriating. 



This is the paraphrased, cliffnotes version of the interaction that just went down: 

My dad put me, my mom, &amp; himself on a 3 way call with his phone on speakerphone &amp; my sister in the background bc of fucking course he did. He suggested that my mom come over to his apartment bc my sister ""really needed a hug."" 

Sister: I'm exhausted. Maybe we can do this in a few days. 

Mom: Why dont you want me to come over. Do you have other plans?

Sister: (awkward laugh) Maybe. Idk, im just tired. 

Dad: (moms name) i really think you should come over so you guys can talk. You two need to talk.

Me: (trying to derail this train before it hurdles into sister) Dad, what are you doing!? Sister is trying not to hurt moms feelings, but shes clearly not up for seeing mom right now. Listen to her! Shes fragile. Moms a trigger for her, it'd be too much right now. Shes saying she needs some time. Thats totally reasonable.

Mom: i have to go, i might stop by in a bit. (Gets off the call)

Dad: (to me) i feel like if they talk it will make things better. Sister said she was fine to see mom when we talked earlier, i asked her about it.

Me: No. Stop. She just said shes not up for it. Shes allowed to change her mind. Listen to what shes telling you.

Sister: thank you, thats what i was trying to say.

Dad: (to me) i just feel like if they saw eachother they could work some of this out. I want to help them.

Me: first off, sister is in the room with you, maybe instead of you &amp; i talking about what we feel she needs, maaaybbbeee we should oh idk, listen to what shes telling us she needs right now. Neither your feelings or moms feelings take priority over her sobriety. They just dont right now. 

Sister: Exactly! Mom is too much, i just don't have the energy to deal with her today.

Dad: (after like half an hour of both me &amp; my sister explaining it to him again &amp; again) okay, fine. I get it. Im sorry, i wont push it. I just wanted to help. 

I think he really did see what we were saying, bc i could hear how much energy it took for him to admit that he was trying to fix things bc of how responsibile he feels for both of their issues. But its hard. It's hard to back off, i get it. I'm the queen of trying to fix the family issues that arent mine to fix. I still do it. I've backed off unless I'm asked for help directly or if i sense actual, physical, danger coming if i dont do something. 



Then, the second, the fucking second i got off the phone, i get these texts from my mom: 



Mom: ""I don't agree at all with what sister and dad is saying

Jsyk

Bullshit she wants to go to get drugs

I guess I don't know that for sure but it sounded like she was going to say she has something she needs to do.""



Cool, so instead of pumping the breaks, she has decided to fucking hit the gas.



So i texted back: ""Yeah, you need to stop that right now. If you're right, then there's nothing you can do to stop her. But if you're wrong, that attitude is just going to push her there and she will smell it on you a mile away. That attitude will 100% sabotage her sobriety. If you cant let that go immediately &amp; trust her to make the right decision then you need to stay away from her. Don't call her. Don't go to dads. Don't track her. (She has gps location enabled on sisters phone.) Do not engage at all.

You need to talk to a therapist before you talk to her again. I'm serious. Your anxieties &amp; trust issues are your issues. You need to deal with that yourself.  You can not push your issues onto her, not when she is this fragile. It will kill her.""



Crickets. No response. I guarantee shes going to go over to my dads and push my sister right off the wagon. It's heartbreaking &amp; infuriating. And there's not a damn thing i can do or say to stop it. 

I can feel myself getting sucked into it. I know exactly how this is going to go down. I dont know what to do with this.",JUSTNOMIL
"Firstly, thank you all for your advice and help re-writing my letter to my JNMother, whom I'd like to name Viking Crybaby (VC for short) if it's available, since she likes to think she's a strong viking lady (even though she's Mexican-American), and uses us to cry ""woe is her, her children don't love her"" to eachother. As well as a note that this will probably be long since it's to do with her reply to me. You can see a version of what I sent to her in my last post through BB, and if you'd like to see the edited one I sent her I can edit it in or post it, but this will already be long enough.

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up deciding to send it for a variety of reasons, mostly because honestly I knew I'd regret not being able to say I gave her an honest to goodness chance to hear what I had to say and change. As background, I never felt like I could say anything about the way she's treated me for many reasons, partially I'm certain, because my normal meter had been conditioned to try to please her as well as I could. I've also always been the outcast type, dark boy clothes, only kinda okay at socializing, introverted, nerd. 

&amp;#x200B;

So growing up I never really knew how to confront people hurting my feelings because it was normal, and all I wanted was to please and have people, especially her, like me. Between her neglect and backhanded comments I grew to have a lot of abandonment and affection issues, combined with always wanting to be okay for my JYDad because I saw how much stress he was always under taking care of me and Older Sister. VC has never been downright mean to me, nor ever been as bad as most of the JNs on here, but her childish narcissism meant that if things weren't about her, making things easier for her, or the way she wanted, you'd know somehow. I honestly don't think that she ever meant to be awful or JN, just that she's so emotionally stunted that she can't help it.

&amp;#x200B;

So all that being said I sent her my letter, doing my best to avoid JADEing and still get my point across without just blowing up on her, and ended it by saying that I didn't hate her, I just didn't have it in me to care anymore, and depending on her response I would either be going NC or would evaluate what I wanted our relationship to be like, but I wasn't going to give her any false hope. Should I have left that bit out? probably, but I felt like I needed to be fair enough to her since this is the first time I'm telling her any of this in my 26 years of life. Give her enough rope to hang herself with essentially. Below is her replies to me, and I'd like to ask for some gentle advice and butt kicking clarity in case I'm too much in the FOG over this. Especially since reading them I'm thinking of opening up communications with her again.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\#1:   
&gt;  
&gt;I don’t want to be unthoughtful and want to acknowledge fully what you feel and what you’ve said so I am going to take the time after work to read everything you’ve said again and answer your questions and answer to what you’ve said to the best of my ability.  
&gt;  
&gt;I understand and hear you, and I will honor your desire to not have me contact you after I reply and will wait until you are ready.   
&gt;  
&gt;I have so much I want to say, I’m pretty confused about some of the things, but this isn’t about me or anything I have to say or questions I have about any of it, it is about the clear and negative impact I had, and I only want to speak about that, because how I have effected you is all that matters.  
&gt;  
&gt;I can’t give you what I should have then, I can’t turn back time and become the mother I should’ve known how to be in the beginning. I wish I could. More than anything. I wish I could’ve seen myself then and how I was hurting you.   
&gt;  
&gt;I really hate myself knowing how I hurt you, and wasn’t there for you and I’m sorry doesn’t even begin to touch that.   
&gt;  
&gt;But I am sorry, so I will say that, more than you’ll ever know.   
&gt;  
&gt;I can answer you this, if you were struggling and needed help now, I would do whatever I could to help. And it makes a difference to me because although you may not see me as your mother, today I am a good person, a good friend, a good mother, daughter, and human. I’m not perfect, but I sure do try to be kind and good and not hurt anyone along my journey. And I want nothing more than the opportunity to have you know me today, instead of the person that failed you. And for me to be blessed enough to know you...  
&gt;  
&gt;I do love you...Always have, the difference being today I know how to love you and show you that.  
&gt;  
&gt;But I’m the one who made the mistakes, so I will need accept you may or may not want anything to do with even who I am today.  
&gt;  
&gt;\#2:  
&gt;  
&gt;I don’t blame anyone else for your opinion of me.   
And I’m not going to bring anyone else into the conversation regarding things. Any rebuttal I may have is really inconsequential to how you feel and I don’t want to dismiss how you feel in any way. I take accountability today fully for my actions, decisions, behavior...for me. My response to what has been said about me really doesn’t matter when this is really about how I impacted you.   
If at some point you decide that you want me to answer specific questions then I will, but only at your request and if you believe it will somehow help you.   
I will address the discovery of JYDad not being your biological father, because I am literally in shock.   
I am speaking with all honesty when I say that was never even something I questioned. I never for one second, never even entered my thoughts, that JYDad wasn’t your dad.  I’m actually pretty blown away by this even though based on what you’ve said about me you likely don’t think I should be. I can’t express enough how awful I feel that a relationship with your biological father was not a part of your life from the beginning.   
I can’t take back anything I did or didn’t do that negatively effected you. I wish I could take any and all of it back.  
All I can do is tell you that today I am not who I was before.  
I won’t go into the things that occurred in my life that molded me in not good ways. They aren’t excuses. But they simply were there.  
There were many from the time I was 6 up to a few years ago, and I still struggle with the lingering effects of trauma. Which is why today I am more than heartbroken and angry at myself for causing you any trauma. Because it is purely unacceptable.  
All I can do to show you that is to continue to grow along the path I’m on today and be here if and when you are ready to want to know me now.  
I won’t fluff this with endless apologies, though I am deeply sorry for pain I’ve caused...because I know that’s not what you need.  
My hope is only that at some point you are ok with getting know me and allowing me to get to know you.   
I love you no matter what.

So, my take away from this is that, she may just be an unintentional JN, and really does want to make an effort to change and be there for me, and on my terms as well. I do see some rugsweeping in her messages, but it looks like Viking Crybaby is actually trying? Am I just in the FOG on this one? I'd like to have a decent relationship with her if only for my younger siblings who will be living with her for at least another 10ish years. You're guys' advice would be really appreciated on this one, though I will say I don't feel like any harsh ""NC Now!"" type advice is helpful, since I am trying to maybe salvage some kind of relationship with this woman.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hello, lovely people of JUSTNOMIL. It's been a hot minute, as I am VVVLC. So LC in fact, that I really only attend events for BF's family that are thrown for children. Other events, my invites are BF telling me MILCapone invited me. Pass. I'm open to gentle advice on how to handle these types of comments next time. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: MILCapone makes BEC comments questioning my religion and ""joking"" that I should break up with her son, my BF. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was personally invited to what is basically BF's niece's preschool graduation. I love his niece, and felt touched that she had requested I be there, and that her dad reached out to me to invite me (must remember to text him thanks after this post). I said I would love to be there, and genuinely felt that way. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course SIL2 ignores us when she shows up, and BF got pretty pissed off at this, but I told him she saved me the extremely unpleasant task of interacting with her, and considered the matter over. The ceremony itself was extremely religious, Jesus Christ was every other word. I don't mind this, to each their own, but for context and later importance in the story, I was raised Jewish, and still observe holidays (although, admittedly, embrace the ISH in Jewish). 

  
Later at dinner, the comment that really made me RAGE, was when BF offered me some prosciutto from an appetizer, joking that it was not kosher. I joked back that I wasn't sure if I was Jewish anymore after the ceremony we attended. MILCapone: “I don’t think you ever really were if you ask me.” Uhhhh my parents spent an exorbitant amount of money on my Bat Mitzvah and Hebrew schooling but okay. I'm a bad Jew, but being Jewish is bad anyways? IDK. Made me very angry, I felt my face get hot. I literally gave her a blank look, then turned to niece's mom and started a new conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout the conversations, my BF was his usual jokey/silly self, which I enjoy. He wasn't even giving me a hard time like we do privately, because I have said we can't be that way in front of his family since they seem to hope it is real discord. But he was jovial and fun and MILCapone kept saying, in response, ""you should break up with him"" and laughing, then not laughing real quick. At one point, she said to BF ""She's going to divorce you before you're even married!"" to which BF replied, ""Divorce IS in my DNA, thanks mom"" (CBF!). She's never made the breakup comments prior (this I know is not just FOG, as I would have noticed), so I feel like she was really ramping up her behavior/comments, and honestly, it pissed me off, especially off the back of the Jewish comment. 

  
Speaking of which, if you have read my post history, I have been accused of being a gold digger (never to my face, obviously). At the restaurant we went out to last night, I chose a dish that is on the cheaper side, but for me, is my favorite dish at this restaurant -- price had nothing to do with my choice. My boyfriend chose a similar dish. MILCapone accused us of being cheap, and then tried to give BF a lot of her meal. She basically laughed at me for my choice in meal, because it was so cheap. Pick one way or the other, MILCapone. I do think this was another thinly veiled pot shot at me being Jewish. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, this got quite long, but I felt the need to share as it really did piss me off and will definitely give my therapist and I something to chew on next week. My BF doesn't really care what she says in the sense that we know they don't support us and they're unpleasant. He was more pissed off his adult sister, SIL2, ignored both of us all night and acted like a child. Again, I feel like we were spared. I do feel like I will talk to him about the kosher jokes in front of MILCapone, because I really detest that she sees my religion as such a joke, or that I don't take it seriously enough, or whatever she was aiming at with that comment. Again -- I don't mind these jokes between him and I, as he and their family is also not extremely religious and we both break ""rules"" as we see fit, but MILCapone gets on her high horse about religion and that bothers me. My win of the night was gifting BF's niece a cute item, that MILCapone didn't realize was from me, and complimenting it and talking it up so much before realizing I was the gifter. That's where we're at folks!",JUSTNOMIL
"I tried posting this before but for some reason it wouldn’t finish posting. 

Anonymous account because not sure how my husband would feel about me posting about his mom here, even though we’re on the same page with her messiness. Buckle in. Cause it’s a long one. And try to keep up. 

My MIL is an absolute disaster. I have plenty of stories of her shenanigans, but I’ll start with her *trying* to ruin our wedding. For a brief background, my MIL has never been fond of me. D(ear)H and I moved in together very early on in our relationship and ever since then my MIL has tried to assert her dominance randomly throughout our relationship. Unfortunately for her, I see right through her shit. She realized she would no longer have control over her precious baby boy (gag) and it went downhill from there.

DH and I got married over the weekend and it went smoothly for the most part. We were both extremely happy to finally be married in front of our friends and family because we’ve actually been married for months and didn’t tell anyone. We had a feeling MIL was going to be a problem, so nothing she did was unexpected. Just added on to her looking a complete mess in front of all our friends and family. 

For whatever reason, she thought it was appropriate to get ready with DH and all of his groomsman, his father (they’re divorced), and some of our other male guests. We both got ready at the same place, him on the bottom floor and me on the very top floor so we never saw each other. But I could very clearly hear his obnoxious ass mom and we have a ton of friends who were looking out for her bullshit. The photographer went down to take photos of them getting ready and one of my bridesmaids boyfriends over heard his mom very clearly say “look at my sexy man.” This is NOT the first time she has called her son sexy. This is the first time other people have been around to catch her creepiness. He (bridesmaids bf) immediately texts my bridesmaid what MIL said and how she tried to backtrack with “handsome little man” when they made eye contact and he gave her a disgusted look. DH is 24 by the way. So of course we’re all gagging upstairs. My photographer, who is a friend, hadn’t known this woman longer than 10 minutes and could pick out that she wanted everything to be about her and made sure everyone knew it. 

Then, as everyone is arriving to the ceremony location and preparing for the ceremony. My DH jokingly says “I need a drink” because honestly, this was the one of the most hectic, stressful weekends of our life. We are and were VERY happy to be married. My BIL overhears MIL make a comment under her breath along the lines of “if you need a drink right now, maybe you should rethink getting married.” Jokes on you lady, we’ve been happily married for months. 

Ceremony goes perfectly, DH and I are as giggly as can be whispering like little kids while the officiant is doing his thing. We’re solely focused on each other with brief sniffles from around us. We exchange rings. Kiss. All is right in the world. UNTIL, MIL who is sitting front and center first chair on the aisle tries to highfive DH as we’re walking back down the aisle. Now, some of you think this is just innocent mom and son relationship. To DH and I, this is full manipulation and wanting to insert herself and assert dominance. At this point, I’m absolutely livid. He waves her off and gives her a look.

Apparently while we were taking photos after the ceremony, she says “Someone’s gonna get booted from the family” whether she was referring to me or herself, who knows. But if she was talking about herself, man, she’s psychic. Let me tell you. DH and I were dreading heading to the reception after taking photos. We wanted to hang out and drink by ourselves. No entertaining. No gossip. Just us. Alcohol. And food. No such luck. 

We finally head to the reception and I’m just bombarded with nonsense. As soon as we got there, DH and I went outside away from everyone and I immediately say “I do not want her here, she’s ruining my vibe.” DH does his best to mediate the situation and calm me down, but I repeat this sentence to him at least 5 times through the night. DH does not do drama. At all. Had he kicked his mom to the curb, all hell would have broken loose. So, I get where he was coming from. 

During our first dance, she kept making comments under her breath. No one was really able to catch what she was saying. When it was their turn for their mother and son dance, she tried to completely copy DH and I’s awkwardly adorable dance and made it just totally uncomfortable. She kept saying “why don’t you want to touch me!” while trying to hold DH around his neck prom style. His grandmother had to tell her numerous times “that’s your son, not your husband.” So yeah, everyone witnessed that crap. 

At one point, the previously mentioned bridesmaid had enough of her shit and started making comments back to her. She has always called him her “baby boy” to which he has expressed he hates countless times. When MIL says it again, bridesmaid says “okay, that’s enough of that. He’s a grown ass man.” MIL then forgets how old DH is and gets snippy with bridesmaid when she corrects her and says “I have too many kids to keep track of.” Y’all. She has TWO kids. Two. DH and a younger child. So bridesmaid jokingly (but not really) says, “wow, what a great mom you are.” Cue MIL, stomping off downstairs crying about “just wait until you have kids.”

MIL is progressively getting more and more wasted as the night goes on. She has zero filter and says some pretty belligerent shit when she’s not drunk. So you can imagine what spews when she is drunk. At one point, she tries to get sentimental with me and drags DH and I downstairs where the bar is and proceeds to try and be a mom to me. “You’re my baby now too. You guys always have a place to stay with me no matter what.” At this point I’m straight gray rocking the absolute shit out of this woman. I’ve had enough. I would go homeless and starve before I ever ran to this woman for a damn thing. 

When I finally changed out of my dress into some comfortable clothes, at some point she had followed me upstairs and on her way out of the room had the nerve to make kissy lips at me from across the room, where 90% of our friends and family are sitting. And when I obviously did not reciprocate, she pretty much all but screams “Synonanonymous didn’t kiss me back” like yeah no shit Sherlock. 

DH and I found ourselves a nice quiet, empty balcony not long after this and had a nice hour long talk (yes in the middle of our reception) about her ruining my night and he definitely agrees he should have handled it better. We then danced alone and cried happy tears about how we’d gotten married earlier in the day and how happy we were. We were not about to let her ruin our day entirely. Our guests didn’t care a single bit that we had disappeared for a good portion of the evening and were even happy we had gotten some alone time. Most of them knowing that MIL was stressing me the hell out. 

Thankfully not long after this she left with one of her FM that was invited. This FM deserves her whole own ministory for another time. Haven’t seen or spoken to her since and don’t plan on it, probably ever again. On our drive home from the wedding, DH and I had an in depth discussion about the future of their relationship and how it got to this point in the first place. We both agree she wasn’t always obsessive, until she realized how serious our relationship was and that she was losing control. 

Not long after we got home, DH sent her a long novel about her disrespect and him being uncomfortable about her weird comments towards him all the time. How this was her chance to make up for all of her wrongdoings towards me/us in the past and she just completely shit on that. He then very matter of factly told her we don’t want her bullshit in our lives. Very surprisingly and unusual of her character, she didn’t respond. We’re waiting for things to blow up this weekend because he’s in his hometown for work and will (he thinks) be seeing her at some point but still hasn’t spoken to her. He didn’t want to call her because he knew she would just get defensive and try to argue. 

My poor DH. The first thing he says to me after sending the text to her was “my heart is racing so fast because it felt so good to finally put an end to her shit.” My husband is an incredible man and how he came from this woman makes no sense to me. I truly married the love of my life and we refuse to let his narcissistic, manipulative mother ruin our marriage.",JUSTNOMIL
"Its been a while since I posted. Bad things have been happening for the family, so we had given Pandora a few weeks benefit of doubt, I tell you what though, what a mistake that was.

Pandora's mother was recently diagnosed with a brain tumour. The loveliest woman in the UK, who has given everything to her family, been a foster parent, adoptive parent, and a nurse for the bulk of the last 40 years, and she has a brain tumour. Its around the size of a grape, and currently we don't know much more than that. Brain surgery is in the cards, once they assess the location, and the rate of growth, and whether if they remove it they do more harm than good. Right now we are all just dealing with each day as it comes. 

And typically Pandora is in her element - Woe is me, my mother is ill, give me attention. For the first few days, we ignored her bullshit, because she was upset. Understandable, we all are. But the moment she came out with this gem, was the moment all sympathy was lost. I've said before that Pandora gets ""migraines"", and that I am not inclined to believe her about the severity of these ""migraines"" because she is a bit of a faker when it comes to illness (see previous posts for the time she caught pleurisy off me, and the brain infection that definitely was not a brain infection). Now her mother has been diagnosed with a brain tumour, Pandora has decided that she must have a brain tumour, and is currently harassing her GP  to refer her to a specialist, because her super horrendous migraines that stop her functioning (but not using the computer) must mean she has one. The one good thing about this outburst is that GMIL has finally realised just how utterly selfish and self-centred her daughter is. 

DP has made an effort to go see her today, after the begging and pleading got too much. She's gotten a bit ridiculous to be honest. Every day, she posts on facebook multiple posts about loving her family. Then she will post pictures, purposely excluding DP, so that he asks where he is, so she can say that she doesn't know as she never sees him. We live 10 mins away, and DP works full time. Prior to the news about GMIL, she made no effort to contact him for 2 months. So today, he went over. And in a repeat of the last time we went over, as soon as he told her he was on his way round, she went out. To get a tattoo. 

When she finally returned, it became something akin to the spanish inquisition. Never ending questioning about his life. And bragging about their recent holiday, and their ludicrous plans to move to the country that they visited. In about 18 months. They are all getting jobs over there and moving...... except SIL would lose her benefits and her medical coverage for her mental illness (and her GF), Pandora hasn't worked in over a year so has no money (BIL is paying half of the bills in addition to a ridiculous amount of rent, and SFIL pays the rest - despite the house and bills being in Pandoras sole name), and SSIL would have to give up her kids or kidnap the one she has in order to go, as there is no way kids dad would let her take her to live abroad. So I am skeptical, however, it would get her away from me, which would be great for when and if we have a baby. So I hope they do scrape the money together.

Oh. And in update to the pet situation. We did not pet sit. SILs GF came all the way from the other end of the country to do it. Brat dog went to stay with GMIL for the duration, when she knew she had the tumour but hadn't told the family so as not to ruin their holiday, and SILs GF watched the cat. Not cats plural plus the others. Cat singular. In addition to rehoming Dog 2, Pandora has rehomed 3 of the 4 cats, the bird, and the reptiles. Without saying a word. 2 of them weren't even hers. DP is disgusted. BIL is angry, as they were his. Cat 4 is old, and poorly trained, so she couldn't find a home that wanted him. I hope wherever they are, they have a much better quality of life. 

So yeah that's the last 2 months. Right now we are just keeping the peace, for GMILs sake. Going NC right now isnt an option. GMIL just wants everyone to get along. She has however, recognised that Pandora is an asshole, and told her off for treating her son (DP) like crap, which hasn't helped, but its nice that someone has finally noticed how badly she treats him.",JUSTNOMIL
"Well my father died this week. I'm not really sure how to feel about it, he wasn't a great dad, had many issues and in the end he needed help and I chose to ignore him because my kid was going through some shit and I'm not strong enough to do both. With that being said I'm his next of kin and I'm the one who had to get things sorted out. 
I made a decision to break no contact with NN via text message and inform my father died. She has my number blocked and will only unblock it to send a nasty message and then immediately block it again. My sister flat out refused to tell her. My only option was a text from the IPad. 
Within moments of receiving this message she sends me a response about how inappropriate it is for me to inform her in a text. Maybe she's right, but my number is blocked anyway it would have been just as bad if I left it on a voicemail she won't listen to and then I would have been blamed for not finding a way to tell her. In this message she tells me to gtfo on funeral arrangements; that dad's cousin, NN and NN current man child of a husband will be planning all the arrangements...
My parents have been divorced since the early 80's why the fuck would this woman think she has any say on anything??? 

Dad's neighbor calls me later in the evening and tells me that NN was at my dad's house today with FM drunk aunt. That she was looking for information about what was going on with my dad. 
What did she think she was going to find at a dead man's house??? Did she think I was hiding inside?? Wtf?!?! 

So the advice needed part comes in later this summer. Dad's final request was no funeral, just a party at the bar. While i dont agree with celebrating the life of a drunk at the bar, this was what he requested and it needs to be done. Many people are very angry with me for bailing on my dad, none of them know why but regardless there are people that will probably disclose to NN when this memorial party will be happening. I'm not sure how to prepare or handle a confrontation with her. I'm still trying to deal with some really major trauma my kids and I experienced a few years ago and people yelling and being agressive pretty much causes me to shut down. She will use this as her stage to publicly tear me apart, in front of my kids, and every drunken friend my dad had. How do I handle this???",JUSTNOMIL
"Old story
My in laws have a very successful business and throw an early Xmas party for their employees every year mid November. My daughters birthday is at the end of November....see where I'm going with this. So we all went to this party as usual, SIL2 spent the day baking a cake with my then 3 year old and soon to be 1 year old. They decorated it with smarties, unknown to me, in the shape of a large 1. It was shoddy out of the packet cake, it looked really tacky but at the end of the day it's cake and I would have enjoyed it. 

So we get to the venue and SIL starts putting these old, half used, half bent, half melted candles on the cake. I ask her 'whose birthday is it?' By now I've seen the one and I'm guessing she's going to say my daughters name but I'm thinking surely now! And yes she said it, she says my daughters name. So I tell her no we won't be cutting a cake for my daughter, as it's not her birthday yet and traditionally we don't celebrate birthdays before the day, always on or after (it's a cultural thing). She said that she feels the same way but MIL wanted a cake for my daughter, so I said thanks but no thanks. MIL overheard the whole thing and while SIL is removing candles, she's barking at her to leave them on regardless of what I've said. Everyone still enjoyed cake. A week later we had DDs 1st birthday party, in our home with our invitees, beautiful decor and a lovely cake made by a friend (she did an outstanding job). All in laws were invited but only SIL1 and SIL2 came and enjoyed the party. Mil refused to attend as she was 'busy' and didn't let FIL attend neither. 

She hijacked my husbands 30th about 8 years ago and DH let her. She did it at a time I couldn't attend until towards the end of the party and it was further from my work and took me three buses to get there. She can do whatever for her kids birthdays but I get to plan mine until my kids are old enough to want to do there own.",JUSTNOMIL
"Obligatory New User, on mobile, etc. 


My grandmother (GM) is kind of a JustNo. I’ve known that for a while now, and have an old example of it I thought would be fitting.

During one of GM’s visits, we were having some conversation about my great-grandfather, her father. We were talking about how we’re proud of our heritage, something of that nature.

GM: He wasn’t Mexican

Us: Yes, he was

GM: No, he wasn’t 

Us: Okay, well if he wasn’t, what was he?

GM: He was a cowboy

Us: ...wtf

GM thinks that her father was not Mexican, but was a cowboy. DH and I have an inside joke about being Cowboynese now. In all honesty, I had and have no idea how to counter this. She’s racist towards Mexican/Native American people and we are both.",JUSTNOMIL

I remember last leaving off that due to this sub it finally hit me that my JNMIL is a major narcissist and that she has now decided to dig her claws into my brother in law's fiance (I'll call her SIL from now on). Well thanks to me giving SIL a heads up as to what she would be dealing with as far as our JNMIL goes, SIL has been able to shut JNMIL down. I mean the woman has seriously been trying everything she can to try and get her way and steamroll SIL, get this, with literally every single tactic she tried with me give or take 4 years ago and yet still managed to give it to her a lot worse. I also mentioned in my last post that although a terrible MIL, she's an awesome grandmother to our children and would never do anything to hurt them.

&amp;#x200B;

***Mouth insert foot***

&amp;#x200B;

I made a (now nuked) post on Monday, this all took place Sunday afternoon while DH &amp; I were out spending time with LO. *(****Little extra info with what somewhat started this****, LO usually goes to in-laws on weekends, and BIL2 comes to our house but DH wanted to keep LO this 1 time. JNMIL gets pissy and tells BIL2 that since she didn't get our LO, he couldn't come to our house. Typical controlling narc)..* Now some of you may or may not remember a post I made months ago (on a now nuked account) about how after I had LO years ago JNMIL threatened DH that if he bought me a certain baby item, she would beat his narrow ass and when I bought it anyway JNMIL used FIL as a FM and coerced DH to their house with LO so they could launch a verbal attack on him...

**Well goddamnit does history have a way of repeating itself because JNMIL decided that this time she was going to do the verbal beating herself... against BIL1.** What causes her to finally spiral? BIL1 informs her that SIL is not comfy leaving their child with her. The thing is, this was her extinction burst because she totally obliterated SIL &amp; I. According to JNMIL she refuses to listen to us bitches *(SIL &amp; I)* or do what we say when it comes to OUR children. Also she claims to have never done anything to disrespect me as a mother or in general and that no one can name 1 thing she's done *(I started a list, it's a page, front and back, could even turn it into a goddamn dissertation if I wanted. She also contradicted herself considering she just said she wasn't going to listen to us when it came to our children).*

&amp;#x200B;

***Now let me just list some of the ways this woman has disrespected me as a mother/person...***

&amp;#x200B;

1. *Tried moving me away from my own JYM when I became pregnant. That came with a tantrum.*
2. *Wrote down everything I wanted and didn't want food wise for my baby shower. Ended up buying all the foods I didn't want or didn't eat.*
3. *Was told people needed to wait until we had LO before coming to the hospital. Was there when I checked in and before I even started to push. Also referred to me as a very popular racial slur that rhymes with trigger when she wasn't allowed to be in the room when I gave birth.*
4. *Disappeared for a week when DH &amp; I told everyone they needed to call first before just showing up after we brought LO home.*
5. *Bought cereal to try and sneak into LO's bottles even after I told her LO wouldn't be getting cereal.*
6. *Was responsible for the crib mobile, bought a pack n play and boppy instead. Then got an attitude when I tried to buy the mobile myself. Didn't even buy the mobile I showed her I wanted.*
7. *Of course the specific baby item incident and the ambush completed with 'GET YOUR BABY AND GET THE FUCK OUT'. This one actually led me to 3 months of NC.*
8. *Tried throwing LO a separate 1st birthday party because I didn't involve her in the one I planned with JYM (she was informed she was more than welcome to but LO wouldn't be there. She never went through with it).*
9. *Called me a lazy bitch for DH &amp; I agreeing that I'd be a SAHM.*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

That's just to name a few and those were only the 1st year of DH &amp; I even being together. Now there were plenty of times I should have put my foot down but I wanted to keep the peace for DH because I loved him and he was very deep in the FOG ***(I now realize this led JNMIL to believe that treating me like this is okay)***. But again guys, she's never disrespected me. So anyways back to the original story. She loses it on BIL1 about SIL &amp; I and then ends the conversation with 'I don't have to listen to y'all, I'm not kissing their asses and I'll just go play with *(coworker's daughter's name)* kids who lives down the street. Catch that? In short she basically said fuck our kids, they're replaceable. HER OWN GRANDCHILDREN!!! Like they're trash! How dare she?!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Again, this was all Sunday afternoon. DH happens to go down there 2 hours after BIL1 to spend time with FIL but is shocked that JNMIL won't even show her face but finds out that she now knows how SIL feels about her babysitting. Fast forward to Monday, SIL calls me to shoot the shit and I tell her she's awesome for telling JNMIL how she really feels.... SIL has no clue what I'm talking about. Oops. BIL is now forced to spill the beans and he spills every last one! So of course me and SIL are livid, seeing red and ready to take a trip to MIL's house. I tell DH and honestly, I think he was more pissed off than me. SIL &amp; I spend Monday night exchanging asshole gifs on the book of faces (insult to injury, fuel on the fire, yes I know but when you're fed up, you're fed up).

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to Tuesday morning, JNMIL has once again turned FIL into a full fledged FM by saying we disrespected her and he's on a warpath. Complete with telling BIL1 and DH that they don't have back bones for letting SIL &amp; I disrespect them and talk shit about them behind closed doors (you know with narcs they can say whatever they want to and about you but when you stand up to them, you're the problem). JNMIL knows this usually gets them in line and they act like good little boys. She's good with leaving out or lying about what she did to provoke an attack... Not this time. DH &amp; BIL1 become UNHINGED. From DH telling him they've done nothing but talk shit and disrespect me as a person and a mother and BIL saying the same regarding SIL with an added bonus on how shitty they were as parents and that they're both happy with the amazing women they have in their lives. They both conclude the controlling bs from JNMIL is over, we will not be rugsweeping this and that seeing their grandchildren is a privilege not a right. FIL texts back good riddance to BIL1 but ultimately places the blame on SIL when he responds back to DH *(in true JNMIL FM fashion)*.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all we're all now NC and they won't be seeing their grandchildren anytime soon. I've spent the last couple of days posting quotes about narcissists on the book of faces and the popular gram where I know she can see them... She has now removed all of her social media pages. But now everyone sees JNMIL for the narc bitch that she has ALWAYS been.

Background: My mother is a severe alcoholic and she has been most of my life. After mother's day we had a heart-to-heart that I felt positive about for the first time in over a decade. All I asked from her was to admit if she's been drinking and be honest, I told I didn't expect perfect sobriety but I did expect honesty and without it she would never have alone time with my coming DD, period.



Last night I began having intense contractions. They were false contractions, but they were agonizing and DH and I thought it was the start of labor. We decided to wait until this morning because we knew contractions could take a long time and I already had a prenatal scheduled first thing today. So I go in, they determine it's false contractions, but some preeclampsia indicators are going off, so I get sent to the hospital to determine what's up.

Basically I sat in a bed for two hours with tubes, needles, and monitors strapped to me while I drank water and listened to music on my phone. Not a big deal. Once I leave, I happen to talk to my dad and tell him about how we had confused false contractions with real ones and how I was waiting for test results to see if I may be induced early. No panic in my tone or anything, and he clearly understands that it's just a formality at this point. That if there's an issue, I'm so close to my due date that I'd just be getting out scot-free by having the baby a couple days early.

Well he tries to convey this message to my mother, but she's been drinking apparently for the last twenty-four hours and basically hears ""she had false labor and may have preeclampsia, was in the hospital all day and could have died!""

So I get a VERY drunk call from my mom basically trying to have a heart-to-heart about my fears and concerns from the day. I'd have been touched if I hadn't been able to essentially smell the vodka thru the phone. 

Afterwards my dad came over and that due to the fact that I was having contractions, he wanted to know a plan.

This why I'm feeling so down and miserable: DH, my father, and I had to have a discussion about what to do if my mother is drunk when I give birth. It was clear and simple. If she's drunk, leave her ass at home and make sure he has all the copies of the car keys hidden. It took an hour to convince him that he could leave my drunk mother at home without having to stay with her. Yes, she gets hurt when she drinks, but he deserved more then to miss out on his first grandbaby because she sucks. He wants to be at the hospital whether or not she's there, and he's earned that. 

Y'all, I cried after he left. Cutting my mom out due to her behavior has been easy, but none of this has been easy on my dad. For years he was an enabler but he's been escaping the FOG and I'm so proud of him. On top of that, he's a good man who has done so much not just for our family but for others too. I want my dad there to welcome his first grandbaby. I want him to be able to sob with joy and have that moment without my mother ruining ONE EVENT in his life. Just one. And I hate my mother more then ever for taking this from him or making him feel like he can't have this.

**EDIT: My father's enabling doesn't manifest in bringing her places and pretending she's sober. He stays home and cloisters them both away from the world. He supports the shame her mother instilled in her by helping her hide it, but she has always been a physical danger when drinking and as such has never allowed her out in public. This is where I'm concerned he won't meet baby. He'll like and say her meds made her sick or blah blah blah. That being said, we already have a plan with the medical team at the hospital on the OFF CHANCE he doesn't realize she's had alcohol or she smuggles it in.**",JUSTNOMIL
"See previous posts for background 

It took a few months but I am finally able to escape everything.  My terrible apartment, this terrible town, and my own mother.

I am sort of dreading moving to a state that is not friendly to trans people but it will only be temporary.  A few months with low cost of living coupled with me hopefully being able to find a temporary job will let me save up a good amount of money in order to move back to an area I enjoy being in.  

There are things that I dont know how I am going to handle yet, for example my medications and the fact that I am slowly getting lined up for ""bottom surgery""  ie sex reassignment.  If the dates for consultation or actual surgery date fall in the time frame that I will be in another state then I guess I will just have to fly back and forth.  I am just unwilling to postpone that whole ordeal even more then I already have.  I have not informed my family of it and I kind of do not intend to.  The drama and begging for me to not follow through would be deafening.

Medical issues aside I wept with joy when I heard I would have this opportunity.  Ive been trying to find a way out for so long and I finally found a door that opened for me.  I am just praying to every diety I know of that I will be able to find a good employer so I can make the most of this.  Even if I dont I will never ever go back, I will always find a way to avoid that....I hope.

I am telling no one what is happening.  I will just be loading up a uhaul with my SO and the both of us are going to run like hell.",JUSTNOMIL
"I have written here before about my FMIL and I thought after a lengthy discussion she had with my partner that things were getting better until today. Boy was I wrong! 
So my son is going to be turning two next Friday and we plan on having a bbq on the Saturday so friends and family can celebrate with us as most family work till late on Friday.  Me and my SO had planned to take my son to a local petting zoo for a couple of hours on his birthday. FMIL called today to let me know that members of family on SO’s side that aren’t on FB we’re coming and that she was excited to be celebrating with us and that it was a shame that we couldn’t hold the BBQ on the Friday and that she was sad that she had to work. I said “ well with most people being unavailable we thought it would be best to do things when most people are free, but it’s ok me and SO are going to be taking him to the petting zoo for a couple of hours” she went quiet for a couple of seconds and then she did her best fake sad voice saying “well what time are you taking him? I’m sure I could get off work early” to which I replied “I’m sorry but me and SO want it to be the three of us but we’ll still be picking you up first thing Saturday morning before the BBQ starts.” She then sounded as though she was really upset asking if we could pick her up on the Friday and she come with us and that she’ll just cancel her appointments that day. To which I asked SO to talk some sense into her because I just couldn’t deal with her at that time.  After 10 minutes my SO gets off the phone and says his mom  really wants to be there and it wasn’t fair that we were excluding her as he’s her first grandchild and she doesn’t want to miss out but he reassured me that he was firm with his mom and that she could not come to the petting zoo.  Shortly after I and SO start receiving messages from her and said that she was coming to the zoo and that was final she would pay for herself and she will just stay at our place on the Friday evening.  Thing is she cannot drive and is demanding me or SO pick her up on the Friday morning. I simply text back and said me and SO will not be doing that as we already have plans that morning and that she shouldn’t miss a days work. FMIL replied back saying “no it’s not right that you are excluding me I deserve to be there too.” 

Me and SO are at a loss for words right now I can’t believe she is trying to make my sons birthday about her and is probably intending to overshadow me again. Ugh.",JUSTNOMIL

TDLR: MIL believes I'm a Satanist and that I was using my lawn furniture in an occultic dark art ritual for financial gain, so she burned it. 

I've been following this sub for awhile, but while being very obnoxious and having no boundaries, my MIL was never THAT bad- until a few weeks ago. around the time she retired.

I'm going to give some context so bear with me. 
MIL is a die-hard born again Christian, I'm a goth. When I say goth I mean outrageous black clothes, dyed hair, tattoos, piercings- you get the idea. It's very much a lifestyle for me, I've been a gothic girl since the 90's. Does that mean I'm sacrificing young virgins to the Dark Lord? NO! 

My husband and I were engaged after just a month of dating, we were married a few months after that. So my MIL was thrown into my life, and I was thrown into hers. Over the years I've put up with many backhanded compliments and insults from her. Here are some gems:

""You have such pretty skin, why cover it up with those tattoos? Have you read the Bible verse about Cain?"" Proceeds to recite bible versus. I get up, make myself a margarita, she's still going.  

""Don't you think THAT (my choker) is a bit risque for a married woman?""

Oh, she also had a panic attack at a BBQ because I was nursing my son and she was convinced the ink from the tattoos i got on my chest a decade ago would leech into my milk and poison him. And/or make him autistic. 

Also for context, I am a small business owner. I gave my husband a leadership position, and after YEARS of hard work and sacrifice things are finally taking off. Together we built a thriving company, and since this supports her son and grandson, you'd think she'd be happy. This didn't happen over night. It took years of working 7 days a week, sometimes starting work at 7AM and finishing at midnight. 

MIL and FIL own 28 acres of land out in the countryside, it used to be an old dairy farm. They own the original farmhouse, but there was also a barn on the property. When our relationship with her was decent, husband and I decided to buy the barn and some land from them, and renovate it into a house. I really wanted my son to grow up close to his family, since I'm essentially no contact with mine. Plus, things were good at the time. The barn was full of her crap- MIL has a bit of a hoarding problem. But they sold it to us, we painstakingly cleaned it out, and we turned it into a beautiful home. However, MIL still refers to it as her barn. She'll visit and say things like 'I love what you did with MY barn.' Or 'You decorated MY barn so nicely!' While there are natural barriers separating our home from hers (a tree line and stream) they are essentially living next door to us.

Onto the Occult furniture bonfire...  

So one night I get home late from work, it's after midnight. I notice there's a huge fire in the fire pit. Odd. But I don't think too much about it. I figure it was my friend G, he lets my dog out and plays with her the nights we work late. We had given G permission to help himself to a beer, enjoy the yard, etc on the days he lets doggo out. I make a mental note to remind him not to leave such big fires unattended, watch it die down as I have a glass of wine, and go to bed. 

The next morning I wake up look outside- and literally spit out my energy drink. The custom made wooden stools that were in a semi circle around the fire pit were smoldering in the remains of the fire. 5 stools and 2 end tables. WTF?? I call G and ask if he knew what the hell happened. G tells me he never made a fire and everything was fine when he left- but he did see MIL pull into our driveway on his way out. I run out of the house and barge into hers- not because I thought she had anything to do with it at this point, but because I thought she might have seen something. I was really upset, my home had been vandalized and I wanted to get to the bottom of it.

I tell her what happened and at first she refuses to talk to me. She claims she has laundry to do. FIL scurries off to the bedroom so now I know something's up. I get suspicious and I'm already pissed as hell so I firmly (okay, aggressively) ask her what the fuck happened to my furniture. 

She admits that she burned it! Why? Because she KNOWS I've been performing Satanic rituals to further my business and that's why we are doing so well. She claims that she knows all about my 'little occultic secret' and that I invited Satan into her home and family. She further explains that there is an epidemic of young business women doing these rituals, and that she refuses to have her family be a part of my 'hellish schemes.'

What the fucking fuck??? 

I left and have been avoiding her for weeks. I'm furious, I feel violated, I feel unsafe in my own home. She burned my personal belongings! Who is to say she won't further vandalize my home? I have no idea what to do from here. I was hoping writing this out and sharing it would make me feel better. But as I read it, I see how crazy it sounds. What the hell do you do when your MIL believes your're a Satanist and burns your stuff??",JUSTNOMIL
"I’ve typed this post what seems like a million times. Yesterday felt like a nightmare and today I feel hungover. I didn’t drink anything because I’m pregnant.. this is an emotional hangover.

DH and I haven’t spoken to MIL since she asked to do skin-to-skin with my baby. We knew that FIL and MIL were having money problems. FIL makes an incredibly decent salary, but supports MIL solely and pays for SILs rent, car payment, and BILs rent. DH and I are the only financially independent couple

When DH was a teenager, FIL bought him a truck. The title of the truck is in FILs name since he’s the initial buyer, but after the first year, DH took over the payments and has since paid it off by himself. DH is the only one who has maintained it and it’s his daily driver. 

At around 6 pm last night, DH got a call from his mother saying she was 15 minutes away from our house and she’s coming to get the title of the truck because her and FIL need it to get a title loan. Technically, DHs name is not on the title so they’re well within their rights to do that. Once MIL and her FM (SIL) arrived at our house, MIL asked DH for his keys. I asked why she needed them if she was just coming for the title. It’s just a piece of paper and it’s on the table waiting for her. She said that plans changed in the last 15 minutes and she’s taking the truck, she’ll call the cops if we try to stop her. They need the truck so they’re taking it since it’s theirs by technicality. We couldn’t do anything because well 🤷🏻‍♀️ on paper, the truck doesn’t belong to us. Doesn’t matter that we use it every day, rely on it, made most of the payments on it, and take care of it. She said sorry, but we need to figure something else out and said thanks for the semi-free truck. DH came unglued. I’ve never seen him like that before. His truck was his baby. I’ve been trying to document everything from here on out, so these are a few of the things I have him saying on video:

“Take the truck. This moves us in the right direction to cut every tie we have with you”

“You’re imposing your problems onto us and making them our problems”

“You let BIL and SIL take advantage of you and we are the ones having to pay for it”

“You’ve hurt us in every way before and now you’ve hurt us financially. Take the truck, and never come here again.”

And finally, “do not show up here again, I don’t want to speak to you or see you”

She said a few choice words. Yelled expletives at me (what the heck did I do) but ultimately, she left with the truck. She’s within her legal rights to do that, but I’m still in shock. Mostly at the nerve of it all. At 6pm we had a truck and by 6:30 it was gone. DH blocked her, SIL, and FIL on all social media and blocked their numbers. We’re looking for a new truck and have found one we’ll test drive tomorrow. At this point, it seems we are NC which is perfectly fine by me, but I hurt for DH. I’m scared she’ll get crazier when our baby arrives. But at least we’ll have privacy in the meantime.

Edit: thank you all for the lovely advice! You’re all so wonderful. As of right now, I hear your suggestions take SILs car, but that’s not up to me. All I can do is push DH to do what’s right but I’m not going to push him too far on this. I hear the suggestions, but I won’t act on them myself because it’s not that easy. I also put no advice wanted in the flair.

Double edit: FIL got denied for the title loan. He confided in a coworker after I went home today",JUSTNOMIL
"Usually I have a memory about Lady I/My/Me that I need to reflect on - and you all have been fantastic helping me realize that it really was never me. Thanks to you all, I can almost laugh at how ridiculously bitchy she was.

Today, however, I am seething over my mother. Yes, I know we seemed to be NC, but she had surgery and we resumed our weekly calls - no mentions of GC (my brother) or his family. We live far away and so most of her interactions with DS &amp; DD are via the phone, especially FT. She called to catch up with them a couple of nights ago. 

Unfortunately, she roused my Mama Bear. 

See, my mother (she really is going to need a name, I think), has a thing about hair. Short hair. Momma loves her some short hair. I once went to visit after not seeing her for over a year and the first thing out of her mouth was ""That HAIR!"" I had let it grow past my shoulders. She prefers the Poodle Look on me (short and curly), which I had in middle and high school. That was a LONG time ago. (I have adult children, for criminy sakes!)

So, she first talks to DS. He was excited to tell her about an award he had won for the third year in a row and a camp he is going to go to. All my mother could fixate on was his hair. He lightened it and has it pouffy on the top. She let him know that she did not like the color and that it was too high. No interest in his accolade or camp.

Then it was onto DD, the only frickin' granddaughter. DD was finally feeling comfortable enough with her ADHD diagnosis to share it with her grandma - AAAAND my mother could only fixate on how much better DD looks with her hair in a longish pixie cut.

My children, being the polite people they are, did not say anything to her until they got off the phone. Then DH and I got to witness their rage and deception that their grandma really does not seem to care about them. DH's response later was, ""what did you expect \[from her\]?

And he is right, my mother is always like that.

I so want to call her out, but not sure I can contain myself. 

And she wonders why my kids never call her.....",JUSTNOMIL
"I am a new user. rSlash drew me to reddit and it has helped me not feel alone. I decided to ask for help. Any advice is welcome. Please be kind. Normally, I do need a swift kick, but these days I am not in the right mindset for that.

Through various experiences in life, my family and I have ended up living with the in-laws. It is me, spouse, 2 kids, and 2 dogs in my family. There is also MIL, FIL, older BIL, and a dog that we have to refer to as my SIL.... Because she is Spouse's sister if that didn't sink in the first time. I hoped for the best when we made the move to Hell House, but I was proven wrong in so many ways. We are stuck here for the time being, so I put up with a LOT! My only other option for housing is a shelter and I am not ready for that. I have promised myself that once we leave, I want either NC or LSC. I keep flipping back and forth because I know deep down that MIL and FIL love the kids. But every time I give them the benefit of the doubt, something happens that makes me want to protect my kids. Like a sudden outburst of screaming at the kids over the tiniest things. MIL especially blames my youngest for so many things that she didn't do, regardless if she was there or not. She treats my kids less than SIL's kids. Both SIL and I hate it. It has started affecting my kids' mental health. I don't know if I should be NC at all or if I should hold out hope for better and have LSC. Or if I should at least let them have LSC with the kids, but have NC myself. Living here has been.... trying for myself as well. I won't push my spouse to choose, but I wanted LC at best for myself. I am asking for advice on what I should do. I have tried raising my concerns with her is civil manners. Just by simply asking she said I attacked her and I hate her. She didn't speak to me for three blissfully peaceful days. Then it all became swept under the rug and we weren't allowed to talk about it ever again. So that's out of the question. I am trying to civil about everything, but MIL makes it difficult. 

This turned out way longer than I meant. I will stop here. Thanks for reading and I look forward to any advice you can give.",JUSTNOMIL
"My FMIL is... not well.

She has a long history of mental illness and drug use, and has been a thorn in my ass since my fiancee and I met. 

FMIL (we'll call her Susan) is the type of person that wants to get blasted on whatever she can get her hands on. Including (but not limited to) pills, cocaine, meth, spray cans, glue, etc.

She often asks us for money to get her fix, and we tell her no every time. Every time we tell her no, she either insults us or threatens to kill herself.

She is no longer allowed to wander our house unsupervised, since she has a penchant for stealing. A few years back, I tore my ACL and needed surgery. Susan invited herself over and stole my pain medication. She's also stolen jewelry from my SO. The most valuable being a necklace that SO inherited from her late great-grandmother.

Over the weekend, Susan had another one of her meltdowns and decided to call SO and ask for money again. When we told her know, she responded by blowing up both of our phones with calls, texts and voicemails. I think at the end of the night, I had received nearly 80 phone calls from her.

Angry, SO and I shut our phones off. Susan's response was to contact my parents on Facebook, and tell them that SO and I were killed in a car accident, and she came down to the Coroner's office and identified our bodies. My Mom and Dad both know that Susan is completely wack-a-doo, but still, hearing the news that we were possibly dead, coupled with our phones being shut off didn't help matters much.

I saw a couple of missed calls from my Mom, and confirmed with her that we were, in fact, not dead. SO called Susan and an argument ensued between the three of us. 

What was Susan's justification for telling my parents that we were dead? She needed a few bucks for gas and groceries. When we didn't answer her calls, she was ""afraid we were dead""

She claims she never told my parents she identified our bodies. My parents divorced when I was 6... I'm 31 now and my parents literally never speak to each other, yet they had the same story. Weird!

TL;DR: FMIL needed ""gas money"" probably for drugs. She told my parents over Facebook that my SO and I were dead when we ignored her calls.

Note: some people have asked me to identify our genders. I am a 31yo male, SO is 31F.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi there guys! I posted this into the relationship advice sub and was referred here. Hoping to find some more help. Its just a copy paste from over there, but the story hasn't changed. I will be talking with my mother tonight finally so maybe an update will be soon to follow. 

Hopefully I can make this relatively quick, as I could use some outside/unbiased opinions on the matter. Also curious AITA? I'll add the TLDR at the end. 

Anyway! Me (F24) and my mom (F45) have had a...tumultuous relationship at best. But let me start with the fact that I love my mother very much. She has made mistakes and done things wrong, as you may see, but I love her. My primary goal is to find a way to fix things with her, if possible. 

When I was a kid my mother was invloved in hard things. She was addicted to drugs along with my stepfather and I spent most of childhood raising my siblings. Then, when I was about 15-16 my mother got sober and was able to clean up her act. She put all of herself into fixing the mistake she had made and being a good mother again. Now she has always been a little high strung. As I got older she liked to make it a priority to hang out as friends, which I never minded. We are friends. We would talk openly about thoughts and feeling about the world and our current SO's. Etc. 

Fast forward to today. She likes to manage me. Know what I'm doing and who I am with despite my age. The incident that started the downfall was simple. In the days prior my Mother had been a force, she was clearly in a mood. I had asked my little brother (who is 23 and is her roommate) to help me move to a new apartment. She texts me the minute she finds out to ask why she didn't know I was moving. Which she did. I had told her the day before in person as well as I had already been living in my new place. This was just me getting the last of my belongings...then the next day after he's helped me and my SO has thanked him with a case of beer, she texts me the minute she finds out to see why she didn't get a free case of beer too. To which I just had nothing to say. Then comes D-Day. My SO throws a pool party at the apartment. We invite co-workers and some siblings. Honestly we had a long week and we wanted a reason to day drink. So of course the moment she finds out she calls. She can't believe she wasnt invited. So at this point I snap a little. I tell her that I'm 24 and I don't have to tell her every thing I am doing everyday. I say that no one invited their parents, it's just not that kind of party. 

We must have argued for only about 5 mins but it was a lot of yelling. She thinks I am not spending enough time with her. (I go over to her house probabaly once maybe more a week. I had stopped for about a month because I was moving, lost/gained a job, etc. Life got in the way). She thinks I am repeating the past because she doesnt like and has never liked my current partner.(when I was 18 I was in college and moved in with my SO at the time. I made some other choices she didnt like so she cut me off. We didn't talk for a year and a half) She also told me that I was being selfish and a bad daughter, etc. Thats the general gist of the convo. 

Now I would do anything for my mother. Just to name a few things of the past for context: I stopped talking to people she doesnt like (i.e. my sister, my aunt, my grandmother). I pay bills for her when I can. I go and try to suprise her with clean-ups around her apartment. I give her rides to and from work (she doesn't have a car). I would let her straight up borrow my car....there are a lot of instances where I did everything I could do for my mom. And truthfully, I probabaly still would. 

Now during this latest fight, I told her she was my mother before she was my friend. She took great offense to that. She kicked out my pet, who was staying with her during my transition. But was I wrong? Shouldn't that be most important? She says her friends are all young and don't mind her being a mom, but thats because they arent her kids. So in my mind, naturally I treat her different then her younger friends. We haven't talked since then (this was Sunday) and I honestly don't even know what I would say to her. I'm tired of being treated like this. All of this is just one instance over years where she has tried to manipulate me with guilt to get what she wants. Or sometimes it seems, just to make me feel crappy. That being said, my dad left us when I was a kid and my stepdad left a lot to be desired. So without her (and understand that if I go talk to her and say something wrong, chances are she will cut me out again) I don't have any parents. Which is kind of rough to comprehend. Especially because if it does go down like that...I have no parents because THEY chose to leave me. 

What do I do Reddit? AITA actually? Help!

TLDR: My controlling mother is mad she didn't get invited to a party my SO had. Now it looks like she may cut me out.",JUSTNOMIL
"My birthday is coming and I'm trying to face it like a strong little soldier. As I said on my first post, my mother died last year, on October. This is the first birthday without my mom and I'm trying to get ready to not let it become a Sadness Fest 2019 

Which reminded me of my first Christmas without my mom, and how Mother Harpy tried SOOOO HARD to be good you guuuuuys...with freaking shower soap

After Mom died, my MIL suddenly felt her heart grow three times its size and tried hard to ask about me to BF. 
I made it clear that, for me, she could just not know jack shit about me, my life and my existence in general; I asked BF to PLEASE not tell her, but out of respect/probably sucking at NC he did tell her. In fact, the whole nest knew about my mother's passing...I mean I didn't wanted to but, I get that social norms demand these things. I guess.

See, they are awful screeching birds but sometimes they can mimic human emotions and empathy. 

Mother Harpy is a good fat stupid parrot that can and will fool you into believing she has some kindness on her. So she tried to pull the ""I'm so sorry for Duskowl loss...! :'("" to BF, hoping for info and because she is a fucking weirdo that LOVES TO TALK ABOUT DEATH.

But BF shot that down fast, and she stopped...until Christmas.

I was a wreck on Christmas. My mother was always in charge of gifts, and gatherings, and cooking...I had to figure out how to do it without her guidance and it was so stressful (Who would had knew buying a book for my nephew was going to be so hard?) 
And I begged BF to not get me ANYTHING. And I mean, ANYTHING. I just wanted him by my side, so I didn't felt so alone and we could all try to pull through Christmas.
New Year's Eve was a nightmare...

Cue BF coming over with a paper bag.
I kinda felt angry but the idea of him trying to at least get me something felt a bit nice...Until I properly see the bag.

A paper bag with MH's writing. And a gift! 
I was shocked but then I started to feel something, and I couldn't figure out what it was...until I properly talked about it with my sister.

In fact, I explained why I was so angry to my sister, my dad and my boyfriend.
I was, deep down, so angry I felt my gut twist like a dragon. If I breathed fire at that moment I wouldn't even be shocked. And for the first time in a while, I exploded and told, hurriedly, what she did to us all these years.

Because...After YEARS of this awful wretched harpy driving US up the walls trying to survive her hysterical nature, she freaking tries to heal the HUGE PACIFIC RIM WITH KAIJUS INCLUDED of our relationship with some
freaking

shower soap?????

After checking my boyfriend's Skype and messages AND FREAKING SENDING A MESSAGE stating how I wasn't welcome because she and her son were ""a team"" and I would never understand how much they went through because she was a single mom that had to work and did everything for her son (Totally brushing off the years of abuse because she was a single mom you guys :'( )


After kicking me out screaming from her home because she wanted to use the computer to browse the book of faces in order to share her freaking political crap
Screaming, like if I was a thief that entered her home

After kicking her only son out because he wasn't doing what SHE wanted, and we having to ask his father for a place in his apartment for my boyfriend
We had days where we were hungry, boyfriend had almost no money, I had to help to buy food...! And then she started to freaking gaslight my boyfriend, buying him food, begging for him to come back

After screaming at us and threatening us with a RO!

After years of acting like I was some random one-night stand of her son and trying to control MY life to do what SHE WANTED ME TO DO because how dare her gorgeous emotionally stunted son date a girl older than him that didn't (GASP!) go to an university*

AFTER ALL THAT...She thinks she can try to reach out to me with SHOWER SOAP? REALLY?

I can't describe my sister's expression after my explosion except ""You must be exaggerating Duskowl!"" (which, coming from someone with a MIL from Hell, kinda feels moot)
My dad tried to say I should try to be nice, maybe send something back...but maybe it was that anger inside me that made me answer to my dad.

""Mom knew all the horrible things she did to me and to BF. She would had understand why this makes me so mad, and I don't expect any of you to understand how it feels for me. I won't send her anything, not even my thanks...she lost that a long time ago.""

Dad and sister went quiet, and I knew damn well my Mom would had been proud of me finally snapping 


MH didn't try any kind of communication again after that. I made it clear to BF that her attempts at buying me were so void it wasn't even funny, and to never EVER bring me things from her if they have any intentions to buy my love.
Mother Harpy loved to try and buy people's love and approval, and while BF stills buys it because he is a moron (I love him but damn he is a moron)...I never did, and never will. My momma didn't raise me to be a faker, deal with it MH 

Still used that freaking soap...it wasn't that good. And if she and her ONLY SON were able to talk for more than five minutes without them going into a war, she would had known I loathe rose scented stuff.  Got a nice sponge out of the deal tho lol

"I'm a bit at a loss right now. I guess I need help figuring out how to set boundaries.

Essentially, TraumaMama and I have always had a particular relationship. Being the only girl and the baby of the family, she's always been overprotective and concerned about my life more than I feel she was toward my brothers. What I mean by this is that they've been able to get away with far more in life than I have, even as an adult. I stopped living with her when I was 16ish (I'm 22 now) partially because I couldn't live with her anymore.

She suffers from anxiety, was previously codependent, and I have a sneaking suspicion she may have BPD, but I'm no psychiatrist. I also suffer from anxiety and am currently on medication for it and I feel I've made loads of progress for the most part. That being said, I still have tremendous anxiety regarding my TraumaMama.

The past year or so, I've noticed that my anxiety has increased in regards to her. Especially making phone calls. I hate making phone calls to begin with, but when TraumaMama asks me to call her during the week, it's like a switch flicks on and I'm filled with dread. Sometimes I do call her, and other times I end up skipping the week and she'll send me a few messages on Facebook until I call her. When I do she's usually dry at the beginning, bitter because I left her hanging because I didn't send her any messages. Which I totally understand I should do because it's the respectful thing to do.

But then she'll start telling me how she's getting older and me not calling her is as though I love her less. She'll tell me that she could be on her death bed or sick and because I didn't bother to call I could have missed it. She goes on about how maybe I don't call her enough because she didn't do a good enough job as a mother, or that I'm deeply disrespecting her. Or she'll be upset if I don't want to tell her how much I got on my tax returns (""I'm just curious""). If I do end up calling her and I'm not in a chatty mood, she'll ask me why I bothered to call, or say that I'm not helping the conversation. Sometimes there will just be dead air on the line because neither of us have anything to say, but I feel obligated to stay on the phone with her for a reason that I can't understand. 

Everything about phoning her gives me crippling anxiety and makes me do things I wouldn't normally do (i.e ignore messages). I feel like the older I get, and the more time I spend away from her, the less I feel inclined to keep in touch. I don't have that desire to call her. It feels more like a chore. I don't want to be passively-aggressively spoken to, or have a hot and cold conversation where one minute she's fine and the other she's upset about something, only to be fine again two minutes later.

On the other end, I feel this sense of obligation toward her. My SO has told me that I don't owe her anything and that once a week is too much for me and that's okay/I shouldn't feel bad about it. Yet, I still feel like I'm being a shitty daughter for not calling once a week. I know it isn't often, and it seems reasonable, but I just can't keep up with it. It wears me down. 

There's a lot more to say about TraumaMama, but it's technically off-topic and that isn't allowed here, and I'm really tired of having this sense of dread. I've made a lot of progress with my anxiety but I feel stuck at where I was when it comes to my mom. She still has such a big emotional hold on me and it scares me.


TL;DR - I get crippling anxiety at the thought of having to call my mom because I never know what to expect.",JUSTNOMIL
"LongTime Lurker! New Account Holder &amp; First Post.. On Mobile... Sorry?

Sorry if this is long!! Just to give small background, I moved states with my SO a few years back due to being welcomed by his JNMOM and his family. I’d just finished high school and we had a kid together who was 2 and neither of us wanted that separation for our kiddo and his family is close knit - so being welcomed I thought it would be fantastic for both my kiddo and I because I have a JNFAM. I’ve unlearned A LOT of bs I was raised with. 

Before we moved up, SO mom would call him everyday to raaaaggg about how she misses him and wants him/us to move up with them so there’s not so far of distance. She would explain how she would get emotional if she didn’t talk to him/us for a day.. ETC. I thought because my family is not like this, it was sweet that she misses him/us that much. My family barely hugs or shows any affection! 

Skip forward to us living moving with them - everything starts off great. Then one day myself and SO mom dad and sis were in the car were talking about celebrity bullshit. (STUPID, I KNOW!) but i was saying what I had read and SO MOM and I were saying the same words at the same time she snaps her fingers balls up her fist and goes “Giirrrrlllllll, I’m talking!” Rolls her eyes, snatches her coat to cover herself and closes her eyes and stops talking. I was in shock like... WTF? Her daughter the goes OOWEEE, she said girl she’s talking and busts out laughing. 

This led up to the relationship going downhill (maybe I took it wrong, but I felt like she was PISSED &amp; to get pissed over celebrity gossip was beyond me). I should’ve took my stupid ass home. It started to be like I was living in a high school home with the pettiness that they were spewing. I would talk to SO and he would say I know them, they aren’t like that. Then instead of asking his mom what’s going on, he would joke to her about how I felt and she’d rub it in my face how SO thinks she not like that. Soon after I was working part time because shit became unbearable and started to even look for income based apts. 

SO tells his mom EVERYTHING (still does today &amp; bc I have LC as much as possible w/ JNSOMOM she’ll have petty conversations about what I’ve told SO to still let me know he tells her my business) and was showing her the income based apts I was looking at. They were apparently not going to be the high class but it wasn’t “ghetto”. She then says let’s go for a ride and went to two of the places I showed SO and pointed out an apartment in each complex that had a missing window shade and was like “you’re planning to move soon, don’t move out here... you see that.. you KNOW it’s the ghetto!” But they’ve lived in the ghetto, I grew up in the ghetto &amp; they do the MOST ghettoest shit that makes me facially say WTF!

Me and SO take a trip back to hometown to visit my fam and I thought it would be perfect timing for me to speak with him again about how I felt and why I would be low key until we move because I didn’t want the pettiness to escalate. He RECORDS my conversation with him and sends it to SO without me knowing. I did not see him recording me at all bc I wouldn’t have even gone back with him because I detailed each situation and let him know how it made me feel! When we do get back I speak and they don’t even speak to me. The next day comes and she is just pressuring me about don’t you want to go home? So I’m just like, why would you think that? She then tells me she heard the recording. So I explain to her, I felt confronting her in her home about my feelings would’ve been disrespectful- especially with SO feeling as if you weren’t the way I was seeing things. And she never admits to feeling a certain way she’d just rather be petty and when you catch on you’re like ... Oh, you’re mad about that? 

I then put fire under SO ass to find an apartment since the ones I found were too ghetto if he wanted me/kiddo to stay. Right when we are signing lease - SOMOM decides she needs a car and asks SO for the down payment WHILE we’re having to pay security AND first month rent to move. I couldn’t believe he did that bullshit. I was so pissed at him. He puts his Mom/Family before his own. Although not married - it’s been 8 years plus a kiddo, about to be 2 kiddos &amp; his mindset is still the same. 

When we got settled, we invited them over for dinner and she was just being super petty Betty, so as we are sitting outside I ask to speak to her to squash whatever it is that’s the issue and it ends up with her walking up on me &amp; grabbing my arms digging her nails in me. A fight ensues.. her/daughter vs. me. During the break up, they were digging their hands through CLAWING my face. From that point on I’ve spoken bc of SO/Kiddo. Other than that, they could kiss my ass until the world ends. 

As I mentioned, we are expecting 2nd kiddo and she wants to just rugsweep and be cool with me again. I’m NOT here for it. She wants me call her and update me on dr visits.. she wants to take the oldest kiddo for a few weeks after I have the baby. HARD NO. oldest had a hard time finding out he was no longer going to be the only baby and he’d be unwanted, and why would I just send kiddo along and confirm that feeling? Shes started texting EVERY MORNING good morning with bit emoji etc and my reply is simply good morning.. She has also invited herself to the delivery. But I’ve already told SO she will not be in the room when I’m delivering, hell I’d honestly prefer she’s not there. I’m really TRYING to be nice.  But I seriously see no need for us to have a relationship.. the stories/memories I have just won’t let me. Not that I’m holding a grudge, but I refuse to keep jumping in front of a train track knowing a train will come.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi everyone! Welcome back to another episode of my dysfunctional life between my family and my future in-laws.

Our wedding is three months away today and if you’ve read my other posts.. I have narcissistic in-laws. Our last interaction with them roughly two weeks ago did not end well and FDH has had time to think and has decided he does not want them at our wedding, what they said during our last interaction was the last straw. Although I am greatly relieved by this decision, I’m also full of anxiety and I feel sick.

He is telling them in person. Any advice on how we can handle this the best way we possibly can? We will be at their home and can thankfully leave at any time.",JUSTNOMIL
"Thank you to all the kind words on my last post. It helped during a terrible shock to know people cared.

DH is fully out of the fog now, and expressing genuine anger at his parents for being shitheels. He frequently uses the phrase ""who does that?"" when describing their behavior to others. And for the first time he's really telling other people what they did instead of protecting their image or rugsweeping. 

We are NC, although that won't stop Toxy and FIL from trying I'm sure. 

I've slowly been making some phone calls, when I have the energy, to fuck up Toxy's life. There are some benefits they were getting locally that you aren't supposed to get if you haven't been paying taxes as the are government run. Not like, food stamp benefits, but more ""we'll help you renovate your sub-code bathroom"" benefits or ""we'll help you replace your energy inefficient appliances"" benefits. So I killed those nice things for them. The IRS is gunning for them now (oh, someone didn't pay taxes on their large insurance settlement that they burned through in less than a year? woops!). Getting $$$ from them will be like geting blood from a stone, but I'll enjoy knowing the IRS is squeezing as hard as they can. 

There have been some ""emergency"" calls from Toxy and FIL that we didn't answer, and in response to their messages called cops for welfare/suicide checks. There are wheels moving there. Fingers crossed, we just might be able to get Toxy committed for perscription drug abuse/rehab, which is what needs to happen even if I hate to do her any favors. But if it doesn't hapen, that's ok too. It's up to the county now.

Most of my energy is just spent trying to get through one day at a time, sometimes one hour or ten minutes at a time. We're both broken people right now. We're holding each other up as best as we can, we buy a lot of tissues and tell each other that it's okay to be not okay right now.  Not everyone gets it, and some peopel have been assholes about it. But we know what our fuzzbutt meant to us, and you all get it, and the people who care about us get it. 

One thing about us is, we've not been able to take a vacation since we got fuzzball, since she was special needs and couldn't be left with a sitter. So we're planning a real vacation now. Hopefully in a year we'll go overseas for a long, long, LONG overdue honeymoon. Only 12 years late! 

And maybe after that, we'll look for another bunny that needs some special care. That's our dear departed fuzzballs' legacy, she taught us how to be damn good bunny parents. And we wil be again.

But not now. For now, we heal.

Peace to you all and all your pets.",JUSTNOMIL
"I posted this in another group but was told this is a better place for advice. Also, I got angrier and thought of some things to add lol.

I need to rant, so bless your heart if you keep reading!

When my husband and I started dating, his parents were great - hands off, nice, etc. Then we got engaged and started planning our wedding. This is when I learned that my MIL has zero respect for boundaries. 

She picked out her dress for the wedding as soon as we decided on a date. She didn’t let my mom pick first, like she should have since my mom was MOB. 
My parents graciously paid for ALL of our wedding and allowed my in-laws to invite whomever they wanted, no number limitations (we had a big wedding, 300+). My in-laws gave a lengthy list but that was fine. BUT then it came to the rehearsal dinner. My in-laws agreed to pay for that as their only contribution, however they got extremely picky about who could come to the point where they didn’t want to allow dates of the wedding party who were driving over 12 hours to be with us. They also invited my husbands aunts and uncles and grandparents but didn’t want me to invite any of mine. Closer to the wedding, after the invitations were all sent, my then fiancé calls me and says his mother has some requests about the wedding. She wants to 1) add some people to the guest list and 2) some family members want to bring friends instead of their kids, that’s cool right? My mother, being the gracious lady that she is, handles the situation before I explode.

Fast forward a year, and my husband and I are expecting our first child. My pregnancy was littered with random drop ins, insisting on visits when I wasn’t feeling well, my MIL announcing my baby on Facebook as “(FIL’s name) and I are very excited to announce that we are expecting”, and overall invading my space.

When I go into labor, my MIL let’s all of my husband’s family know and invites them to the hospital, even though that’s not what we wanted. Thankfully hospital staff are awesome and don’t let anyone in. After baby is born and my parents and in-laws come to see, the nurse comes in and announces that she needs to check me out before we switch rooms. My family tactfully leaves, saying they’ll grab dinner and see me in my new room when I’m ready. MIL and FIL stay. I’m glaring daggers at my hubby, but he is too focused on gathering our belongings to notice. So I get quite a revealing check with my in-laws watching. Like, hello? Please leave.

Once we’re home, MIL texts me frequently things like “this grandma needs to see her little boy, I haven’t seen him in so long! I’m free Thursday or Friday. Let me know which day.” I guess that’s better than showing up, but when it’s multiple times in a week and she doesn’t help with anything or bring anything, it’s too much.

At a few months old, my son spent a week in the PICU due to a serious illness. On our way to the ER we texted both sets of parents to let them know what was going on. When we were still in the ER figuring everything out (transfer to a bigger hospital, severity, etc.), my husband gets a call from his mother. She is half way to the hospital that baby will be transferred to (even though the ambulance won’t take us for a few hours) and she wants to know why she hasn’t been updated; her son needs to let her know what’s going on. Sorry, lady, our newborn is in the ER. We aren’t thinking about ANYONE else.

Once we are transferred, in-laws show up for a visit the next day wanting to cuddle baby and trying to touch all over him. I couldn’t even feed my baby and was not allowed to hold him until that afternoon. No one else was touching him. Meanwhile, my mom showed up with bags of food, toiletries, and coffee. Sat quietly with me. Let me cry. Didn’t ask anything of me. You know, comforted me. I felt like my in-laws were there to make themselves feel better. 

We recently moved a little under 2 hours away. We still make sure to see my in-laws at least once a month. My MIL calls my son “my little boy” and makes passive aggressive comments when talking to my son like “you probably don’t recognize grandma because you never see her anymore, do you?” When we do see them, she won’t give my son space, interrupts his naps, and gives much unwanted advice.

Most recently, my in-laws attended one my family’s gatherings. I’m in a very dear friend’s wedding at the end of the summer. We were all sitting around talking and my father-in-law asked the specific date of the wedding. I told him and asked why. My MIL responded with “oh we’re coming with you to watch the baby, we just need the dates to reserve the hotel.” They never asked us about this. They are not invited to the wedding. And my son still nurses AND my friend wants him there.

PHEW. Sorry for the long post. I feel like all of these examples are small things but they are building and making me super frustrated. I don’t want to resent or dislike my in-laws but I’m starting to feel that way. Their passive-aggressive behavior is just too much! Any advice??

EDIT: My husband totally has my back in every situation. He doesn’t have the greatest relationship with his parents, so he tends to ignore things better than I do. He has told his mom “no” on quite a few occasions, she just doesn’t respect him. So I feel like I need to step up and tell her off.",JUSTNOMIL
"Things have been pretty uneventful on the in-law front because they have been babysitting the nephew for the past 3 months. Just some BEC type stuff that DH and I have laughed about. Trying to keep us from giving nephew some birthday presents we got him. Getting me the saddest most pathetic pot of petunias for my birthday and then showing me all the nice baskets she got for herself. Letting us know that her mother had knitted all sorts of baby blankets and hats for the nephew when he was born. Obviously nothing for our future LO, although her own MIL that she hates has recruited her old lady friends and they are sending us a package of homemade stuff which is pretty cute and made DH happy. MIL did finally give me the baby clothes she had been stashing (check post history), along with some very old toys from when DH was born. There was random guilt tripping directed at DH for various things, one of which was the fact that my mom bought us a crib AGAIN. So I brought it up to FIL and said if they want to help out they should let us know because baby is going to be here soon and it seems very important to MIL. He said he wants to and to send him the Amazon links, so I did and it was ordered within a couple hours. Then MIL had to blow my phone up which I completely ignored, and she never brought it up again. 

Anyways, back to the point. I'm now less than 6 weeks away from my due date. Nephew is gone back home finally and I'm thinking MIL is bored. She's been nagging at DH to come over to our house. Not asking when would be good, just saying she's coming over on this day at this time. He shuts her down and it doesn't happen because that's not how plans are made amongst adults. I don't like having her over because she's on even worse behaviour towards me when she's in my home so I'm not making plans with her either haha. 

She is now calling me on a daily basis. Which I've been ignoring. She sent one text ""Just want to see how you're doing and catch up. Talk later."" I also ignored that. She's not blowing my phone up by any means, but I know she will be reporting back to all her people and FIL about how I'm mad at her, I'm mean to her blah blah blah which doesn't really bother me as I don't know these people and probably never will, but it seems to make her bitchiness snowball when she gets into this groove and neither of us want to deal with that. 

What would ya'll say that's firm but not overly bitchy? (A little bitchy is okay, I just know she will show her people what I say so I want to at least appear to be the bigger person haha.)  I need to let her know that we aren't going to be best friends now that I'm close to having the baby and I have no interest in trying to create some kind of relationship at this point in time. We aren't planning on keeping them from meeting our LO or having a normal grandparent/grandchild relationship with her, but they definitely won't be babysitting or having unsupervised time. 

I just want this woman to leave me the fuck alone! Clearly just plain old ignoring isn't going to work UGH.",JUSTNOMIL
"It’s only a short update and it was mostly BEC but I feel like I’ve had a win today!

So DD has apparently been stealing pacifiers from the other babies at nursery to play with. We’ve never given her a pacifier of her own. She’s never needed one. And it’s my personal choice to keep breast feeding her for comfort. But I’d never dream of judging someone who gave their child one. Your child, your decision. 

ET has ALWAYS, ALWAYS been really fucking judgemental about pacifiers. Anytime she sees or hears that a child has a pacifier she starts going on a psychotic rant about how she hates the things. Bearing in mind DH had one as a child. And he had his way into toddlerhood as they basically had to coax him into giving his up by pretending to give it to the pacifier fairy by throwing it in the fire. 

So today I relayed the story to the family group about DD stealing pacifiers to play with and how it made me laugh. ET responds with, “oh she should have chucked them in the bin!”

My response was “it’s not for us to judge if parents give their child a pacifier. I just thought it was funny”

She’s come back with “it’s a joke”. You bloody liar. You’re backtracking because I’ve called you out for being a judgemental twat in front of your family. I’ve had to listen to enough of your anti pacifier rants over the years to know. I’d once said that if DD ever needed one I’d give it to her as I’d rather she have one rather than suck her thumb as you can at least take a pacifier away. She wouldn’t shut up about how that’s an awful idea bla bla bla. 

So I’m personally taking it as a win that I’ve called her out on her BS. I’m hoping to continue to do so as she always gives me plenty of ammunition which I’ve mostly just ignored or grey rocked. Next stop, telling her to stop making fun of BIL’s gf’s regional accent.

"More BEC. This woman is driving me bonkers lately.

So I have two cars, but I keep one at MIL’s house since our apartment complex only gives us two parking spaces. The battery died a few months ago after a snowstorm, and I finally had the money to buy a new one. I went with FDH to go switch out the batteries. MIL comes out to the garage and says “Oh, good! I was gonna talk to you; I found car insurance for your car for only $50. You pay $25, I’ll pay $25, and we’re good to go!” I gave her a “Wtf?” look and said “Well first off, I’m not paying insurance on a car that I’m not even driving. Second, I’m here to take pictures of it now that I have a new battery, so I can sell it.” MIL goes “Oh, you’re selling it? I’ll buy it off you! $1,000!” (Remember, she has no job and spends everyone else’s money on cigarettes and booze. Where exactly is this $1,000 coming from? Heeeeellll to the no.) I told her “No thank you, my mechanic gave me a range of what to sell it for and $1,000 is far below that range. Thank you though.” She gets all huffy and puffy and goes “HRMPH. Well I know all about cars, and your car isn’t worth more than that!” I smiled sweetly and said “Well, you’re not the mechanic who worked on it.” She glares at me and says “Don’t say I didn’t try and offer!”

FDH and I get the battery in, and pictures taken. We go back inside and say hi to FDH’s best friend before we leave. MIL pops in the room, and starts going on about how beautiful she’s going to look at the wedding with her hair and makeup all done. This goes on for a few minutes before she realizes that none of us are listening to her. She tries to bring me into a conversation, saying “OP, I’m sure you’ll look beautiful too! I can already picture your dress and hair and everything already!” (Note: I haven’t shown her any pictures of my dress or hair, or anything like that. She has ZERO idea other than whatever she’s concocted in her crazy head.) I try to play nice, and ask her, “Would you like to see a picture of the hairstyle I chose?” She says yes, and I show her a picture on my phone. She stares at it for a minute, and goes “You are NOT wearing your hair like that!” I looked her dead in the eyes, and with as much sass as I could manage, I told her “Yes, I am.” MIL doesn’t like this. She raises her voice and says “No, the hell you’re not! You’ll look ridiculous with those pink things in your hair!” I just said again, “Yes, I am.” At this point, FDH speaks up, and tells her “OP can do whatever she wants; it’s OUR wedding. It’s not your hair, and she looks beautiful with her hair like that. I can’t wait to see it on the big day.” MIL practically throws my phone back at me and storms out. I look at the picture again, and then it dawned on me. MIL doesn’t realize that the Snapchat filter teddy bear ears are a filter, and not an actual hair accessory. *Facepalm* But, I’m not gonna tell her that. I’m just gonna roll with this one. FDH, best friend, and I got a chuckle out of that though.",JUSTNOMIL

"Sorry for any grammar or spelling issues. My phone wont let me go back and edit after it's written. This is an old story, but my grandma filled me in on the parts I didn't know. I wish I could say I was shocked.

I have 2 younger half brothers (6 and 8 years my junior). Just a small note for later.

I was my 11th birthday and I was invited out shopping for school clothes with my grandma (my dads step mom).  She made me try on everything for her, making sure it didn't show to much, didn't ride up when I bent over and what not. Acceptable for her granddaughter and school.  She bought them all, no talk of pricing. Just Happy Birthday sweetheart I hope you like them.  

Got dropped off at my moms house and everything changed. She acted happy to see me, until she seen I had a bag of stuff. ""Oh let me see what you got"". Starts taking out clothing one by one telling me why each one was not something I was allowed to wear. ""This shirt is to tight"", "" I can see your bra strap"", ""Whose attention are you trying to get with these pants?"". I think you may be seeing the pattern here.  She decided we would go back to the store and return everything and get things she thought was better. 

Off we went, me upset but obeyed quietly. Maybe I'd find something else I really liked. Return the stuff and head to the girls section. I find a shelf of Tshirts. I grab one, she says no. I grab another I like, she sighs and goes ""sure but that's all you get"". I tried to protest a little and tell her that grandma had bought me more than that. I was told ""don't argue or you get nothing. Now come on we need to get stuff for your brothers.""

2 weeks later I was back at my grandparents for a sleep over. My grandma asked me what the other kids thought of my new stuff. I told her they didn't get to see them. She was puzzled and asked me why I hadn't wore them yet. I explained the story above.  She inquired what the rest of the money was spent on, if I was given the rest to hold onto later. No the whole gift card my mom got for my stuff was spent. I didn't really understand the amounts spent, I didn't care about that. Grandma drops it and we go on to have a great night.

Next morning mom comes to pick me up, grandma sends me to the car so she can talk to me mom for a minute. This next bit is from what my grandma told me recently. She started by asking my mom if she returned the clothes and why. My mom ""because they show to much, she looks like a slut. My grandma says she made me try them all on. My mom doesn't care, she's the mom. Ok fine, grandma drops that point. So what did she buy me to replace it? ""Only one shirt?!I spent 200$ on her. Where's the rest?"" 
My mom ""Oh I spent it on the boys, it wasn't fair that they got nothing and she got so much.   ""IrishSkyGods mom you had no right. Those were gifts for **her** birthday. They have family that buy them gifts and she gets nothing, so why would she have to share?"". Mom ""Because she has 2 families already, she doesn't deserve his (my step dads) family as well. Plus you're the only one that has money just to blow"". My grandma tried to protest but my mom simply said ""If you don't like it start buying them gifts for them too or don't get her anything""

Every year my grandma would buy them both Christmas and a small birthday gift so they didn't feel left out. Why did they need my birthday too?  So many birthdays she's ruined for stuff like that or worse. Like having her moms funeral  on my birthday weekend, 6months after my grandma passed away. But that's a different more painful story that I might share later.",JUSTNOMIL
"MIL was cooking something and left oil ALL over the stove. My daughter and I were gonna bake some sweets for her bake sale. My DH was at work 1h and 35 mins away. Daughter was in the living room. I was in my 3 year old son’s room getting him dressed because he had T-Ball. My daughter saw flickering lights in the kitchen, so she went and looked because she thought it was her dad. She screamed “MOM THERE’S A FIRE!!!” and I was shocked. I leave my son’s room and run to the kitchen. I yell at her to grab her brother and the dog and to try to get one of the neighbor’s attention. I stayed inside trying to get the fire out but it just grew. I got two- third degree burns. One on my neck and one on my hand. My neighbor was luckily out side and ran across the street to our house and called the fire department. my kids and dog had to go to another neighbors house. My DH came home about two hours later. My kids spent the night at their Great Grandmother’s that night. Let’s just say MIL was moving out a couple of months later.

Edit: This is an old story from about
2017ish. Thanks for all the support! I don’t believe she did this on purpose, but like i said replying to someone’s comment, she doesn’t take care of herself. It’s not because she’s old. She hasn’t EVER taken care of herself. Not in her twenties, thirties, ANYTIME. Throws up? Leaves it everywhere. Spills food? Leave it everywhere. Leave oil on the stove that could start a fire? Leave it everywhere.",JUSTNOMIL

TW: abortion

&amp;amp;#x200B;

We decided to start trying for a baby this year, and we're now expecting! I'm currently almost 8 weeks pregnant, and we've told both sides of the family (I'm really wishing we didn't tell anyone, but I couldn't hide my morning sickness well). We told my parents first, and JustYesDad (JYD) was stoked. JustNoMom (JNM) just wanted to know how far along I was, and the proceeded to whine about how she has to wait until the 12 week mark before she can start telling people... and I told her that maybe she should actually ask US how we feel about that, but her narc self just told us that she can be proud of her kid and it's exciting news to share and I should stop taking things away from her like I did with my wedding (ugh, another chapter for another time).

&amp;amp;#x200B;

After we told them, she tried to insert herself into the ultrasounds. I shut that down real fast and said no, I only want DH there with me for them. Boy did JNM get pissy and demand to be there when we go. I stood my ground and simply said no and dropped the subject. We did our dating scan this week, and she didn't even comment on the photo - just passed it to JYD. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Since then, she's sent me two videos on the book of faces about babies matching mine in age (so early first trimester): one was ""apparently"" 7 weeks but formed to 12 weeks and this lady regretted her abortion and showed this... little one on her hand which was just nauseating. I deleted the video. Then today she sends me a second one of an ectopic pregnancy and they've had to remove this little one and it moves and wiggles.. it's 8 weeks. I just cried a little, told her that it made me uncomfortable to see such things because it reminded me of my sprog. Needless to say she told me that I'm full of shit and she won't send me something again. A part of me is relieved, but the other part knows she's see something and forward it along soon enough. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

She's going to lose her shit when I tell her she's not coming for the birth. I discussed with DH that I didn't want anyone but him and the midwife present because JNM stresses me the hell out as it is.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

TL:DR: am I overreacting for telling my mother videos of abortion-related content make me uncomfortable?

Edit: the absolute kicker is we all live together (Co own the house) so leaving is pretty much out of the question for a few years 😔",JUSTNOMIL
"Margot has broken her vow of silence! 

If you recall from my last post about her, I went NC with Margot for a little while (which is what Margot wanted as well). She ended up texting me the next day, basically saying how I was in the wrong for my behavior. 

Because I still want a relationship with Margot, I sent a text back simply stating that neither of us believe we are in the wrong and since that isn’t going to change, we can either move past it or let it dictate where our relationship goes; as in, nowhere. I did make clear to her, however, that things were not going to continue as they had before, and if she broke any boundaries that we would go back to NC. She agreed and we moved on. 

About a week later, Margot came over to help me out around the house. I’ve had a lot of dizziness while being pregnant, that I couldn’t even shower without the fear of falling over. She came over to help me out with some cleaning and to be there while I showered incase I needed her help. DH was working a double, so he was gone most of the day. Margot even blow dried my hair since I was completely out of energy. Things seem to be going well, but we will see how long that lasts. 

Now to the part I’m becoming irritated about after just a few short weeks of being pleasant: Margot is about to lose her job! 

Margot has quit/been fired from many jobs for others “being mean” to her at work places, disagreeing with bosses and coworkers, and simply having a mouth she can’t see to close. She always has an attitude when she feels as though someone is having one with her, and sometimes even when they’re not. It has been hard for her to keep a job and she uses her bipolar disorder as an excuse for this (to those to do have it, NOT BASHING!! Margot uses hers as a crutch). Says it’s just how she is and she isn’t going to change for anyone. This time around, she’s leaving this job because she was “threatened” with continued probation for her new job that was started only a few months ago. 

The reason it frustrates me so much, and affects me very mildly, is because she feels as though I understand where she’s coming from. I’ve been diagnosed as bipolar, and then undiagnosed by another doctor, so it’s up in the air as to whether or not I am as well. But Margot is hellbent that I am and feels like I can relate to her leaving jobs over it. I can’t! She believes that I will give her the validation of leaving her job, since no one else will. Sorry, Margot, not going to happen!",JUSTNOMIL
"First off, I'm new to this sub. If something violates a rule or I haven't done something right, please let me know and I'll fix it.

Now, a little background: My MIL is a snowplow parent and both of her adult sons (BIL-1, early twenties and BIL-2, 30) still live at home. She has positioned herself as a crutch in the family, in hopes that all of her adult children remain dependent on her. All of my inlaws are that person who acts like they're always right about everything they say and in everything they do. And they have a penchant for asking favors and then making them unnecessarily difficult.

On to the story.

Earlier this week, my MIL asked us to take BIL-1 (the younger one) to finally do the driving test to finally get his driver's license. Because of MIL's snowplow approach, he has never gotten his driver's license or held a job. Understanding that this would finally help him make some progress in his life, we agreed to drive him there this Saturday, as they would be unable to do so since the rest of the family is taking a trip to California and they waited until the last minute – his thing expires after Saturday and he’ll have to take the written test all over again.

This morning, my wife texted me with an update. This is the summary she sent of a conversation between her (DW) and MIL.

&gt; DW: So what's happening with BIL-1’s driving test?

&gt; MIL: I don't know you need to find a place that is open for him to take it on Saturday.

&gt; DW: Why should I have to do that? Also, didn't I already do that? It says Saturday by appointment only. He needs to call and schedule it if that's what he needs.

&gt; MIL: DW, do you not understand that your brother is in classes or is working all day long? While you're at home not working right now?! (Side note: my wife is 7 months pregnant in a high-risk pregnancy)

&gt; DW: I am not working right now because I am supposed to be resting and focusing on my health. You and he need to understand that his life doesn't get less busy with age! Also, I am quite busy myself even though I am not working right now. You guys are lucky I was able to clear my schedule for Saturday to give him a ride!

At this point, BIL-2 (they always talk on speaker and everyone gets involved in everyone else’s stuff) pipes in and says to my wife, “Well don't you sound like a whining millennial that needs mommy to do everything for her?”

&gt; DW: BIL-2, NONE OF THIS IS FOR ME! I am the one doing the favor here. Some people just seem to have unreasonable expectations. I should only need to be told where and when to pick him up!

TL;DR: My MIL asked if we could take my adult BIL to get his driver’s license. We said yes to that. Turns out they waited until the last minute and decided to go to Cali instead of taking care of this. Now they want us to find a place to do the test, schedule it, and drive two hours to take him there and back. MIL told my DW that she should have plenty of time since she’s just pregnant (high risk) and at home all the time. Other BIL trash talked my wife because he’s a 30-year-old momma’s boy still living at home and going nowhere.

Ya’ll, I’m sick of people not taking care of their own crap and trying to dump it on the only responsible people in the family. You’re all adults. Clean up your own messes.

EDIT: Fixed mixed use of SO and DW.",JUSTNOMIL
"My MIL was just no when my kids were younger. I thought we had placed good boundaries. My MIL knows I’m the gatekeeper to the kids and typically doesn’t mess with me or the kids. She also lives 2 hours away, so we don’t have to see her too often. 

To the story: MIL’s family has a family reunion every year which we are invited to and try to attend. This year the reunion is at MIL’s house. We arrive at the party to learn that it’s actually a surprise birthday party for my husband’s milestone birthday. My MIL planned a surprise birthday party for my husband without letting me know. I was/am furious that she didn’t tell me. Seems like something the wife should be in on... 

The next day of our visit we had already planned on visiting a local attraction an hour outside of town. We all had a great time and we’re going to head back to town for lunch. Due to food restrictions, my family and FIL couldn’t eat anything at the cafe at the attraction. Well... MIL skipped breakfast and “couldn’t wait” to eat, so we -husband, me, kids, and FIL - had to wait while she ordered food at the cafe... so we could drive to the restaurant and eat lunch (where she could eat too). 

Next day, same thing, local attraction, we are waiting for her to eat because she skipped breakfast and “had to eat now”. 

So, I have 2 questions: 
1) Am I overreaction by being livid that she didn’t tell me about the party? 
2) We preplanned a week long vacation with her. How do I handle the eating at different times that everyone else and her basic disregard for the kids and their needs?",JUSTNOMIL
"My mil is a huge flake. She make plans then cancels. She says she will call then doesn't. We call her repeatedly, she doesn't answer her phone. (Check previous posts on issues. ) It's been like this for years. I have two kids. Basically, to make a long story short it's not right to be treated the way she's been treating me, and us, and my three year old doesn't even want to visit her now. I hadn't said anything before today because last time I did she freaked out on me. It's been building up for a long time and I just wanted to tell people that go through similar stuff about it I guess to share the relief. I don't even care if she's pissed. Fuck her. I feel so much relief finally saying enough is fucking enough! I had been trying to keep the peace but she cancelled again after telling my son she would come over today then cancelling again last night and saying she didn't realize it was set in stone. She literally told my kid in front of me that she would come over today and see him then said that her words meant nothing?...like saying that doesn't mean she's going to show up? I mean, how much more literal can you be? Enough if that shit. No more. Shes mad and takes little responsibility for her behavior. Whatever. I regret nothing.

"First thing that needs to be noted here is that my inlaws convinced my husband and I that getting on their phone plan would cost us less while giving us extra benefits. This is important for later on.

Okay, so yesterday, when I went to pick up my son from inlaws, MIL took me aside and went off on me. She said LO was being super clingy to her all day and was misbehaving (he is a 1 year old, this stuff isn't exactly uncommon and my therapist actually pointed out how common it is for little kids to behave this way).

My husband is an OTR truck driver and we spend a lot of time talking on the phone facetiming and just talking. This is also how he is able to maintain a relationship with our son. The day before all this my husband and I had had a discussion about what has been going on lately in our marriage. While it was a stern discussion, we were not yelling at each other. However, this was a fight that took place in front of LO and we should not have been fighting in the first place in front of him.

MIL looked at our phone records, saw that me and DH were conversing for 3 hours the day before, and deduced that we had had a screaming match in front of LO and that was why he was behaving the way he was. So she took me outside, and started yelling at me about how DH and I are behaving like highschoolers with a bunch of petty nonsense. She was angry about how I had handled the situation with my husband (if anyone would like to look back at my other posts through the bot you can, but basically I hid the fact that I was getting LO vaccinated because he and his whole family are rabidly antivax; my husband and I are working this out). She then went on to question why I had gotten him vaccinated and her usual ""I'm vaccine injured and so is DH so they are bad"" speil. She waited for my answer and I said, ""Because I don't want LO to die."" (Or something to this effect as I don't quite remember in the heat of the moment)

She freakin' blew her top! She told me that my family was nothing but a bunch of liars and manipulators. She went on to accuse me to my face that I was cheating with my boss (also in my post history) because I one day early in my job got a ""mysterious phone call"" at around 7 one night they had to watch LO so I could work a night shift (I remember exactly when that was and that was my boss calling to confirm that I was going to be at work that night in a few hours) and because she saw me driving back from the direction of the hotel at the stop light to turn off onto the road we live on (not like there are other businesses down there like Dollar General, Tractor Supply, Sonic, Chicken Express, Burger King, and also our storage unit is down the same highway).

She also went on to tell me that my house looked like a crack house the other day when she had to come by (there were some dishes in the sink and clutter on the counter, table, and floors mainly from the baby). She also accused me of not changing out and cleaning the litterbox for our cats in months (I was doing it every three days, once went a week at most) and that she knew it was that way because my son had a bit of a wheezing problem when he was a little baby and she called bs on me saying it was allergies even though that is what the pediatrician said.

Finally, she went on again to say that she knew when I had gotten my son vaccinated because he had a ""rash"" on his arm (they put the shot in the thighs!!!) and he had behaved differently a few weeks back. This is also bs as although I got my son his last shots about a week ago, the last time before that was in February, months before I started working and they started watching him on a daily basis.

DH doesn't understand how infuriating all this is and still wants me to play nice. I had to drop my son off today and only saw MIL when I picked up my son after work when I ""played nice"" and bought them some groceries (since they thought I was a selfish bitch for not offering only about a month ago; this is another story I plan on telling here soon). She didn't say a word about yesterday and I doubt she will since she sits on a high horse.

Here is my question though; am I just being defensive, or was she legitily being hypocritical by calling my a child and petty when that is exactly what she did?

"Advice welcome, but not required or obligated. Share your thoughts, or don't. Either way. &lt;3  


Backstory: My post from yesterday. You guys have all been wonderfully encouraging and have said some amazing things. I tried to respond to most everyone, but if I didn't, please know that your words touched my heart.

&amp;#x200B;

I get home from work and try to talk to DH about it. He doesn't want to talk. I check his phone, and there's an unread text from them. (maintaining perspective names, DH is my DH even when MIL is talking about her son. She obviously didn't call him DH).

&amp;#x200B;

DH, I apologized to 38592. That's what you said I needed to do. She never really wanted an apology.  If she did, she would have accepted it and opened up the line of communication.  She does not want us in your life, period.  She blames us for the drama, but it is actually her drama. She wants to control you and me and her daughter.  She doesn't want you to have a relationship with your parents.  We just never realized how much you hated us.  It is heartbreaking to realize all those years of fun times together,  you really couldn't stand us.  Man this is hard on your father!  I know we were good parents to you and we would be great grandparents to your daughter, but you are taking that away from her.  Please be a man and call us so we can say goodbye.  I think we deserve that much from you.  Just think hard about your choice.  It was easy for her to walk away from her parents, they had nothing to offer her.  That is not the case with us.  I would still like to try and repair the relationship with you.  You are our son and we will always be your parents.  I can't believe you would walk away from us, but we are ready to say goodbye.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: They didn't respond to me. But I responded to them, from my account.

&amp;#x200B;

I read your text. I'm rather shocked that calling to say goodbye is your definition of ""being a man"", and that concerns me. I don't hate you. DH doesn't hate you. We just hate the games you play. When you're done throwing emotional tantrums, you're welcome back in our lives.

I honestly think I'm the first person in the family to stand up and put my foot down to end the nonsense. DH doesn't do it, so I will. Responses like what you just sent to DH are exactly why I feel the need to set boundaries and keep that behavior out of my home. It's the behavior that I'm firmly against, not you yourself.   If you want to talk like two adults (unless that's something said in the heat of the moment that you wish me to not take seriously, I wasn't sure), then I'm open to talk. I would welcome a relationship with you, just without the drama and the games.   Kiddo asks about you. She wants to see you. I've, sadly, had to tell her that you're busy, but maybe we'll see you some other day.  However, if you genuinely wish to say goodbye as you've mentioned in two different texts, that is your choice and I'm willing to respect it.   I hope you have a good night.

"Originally posted  [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bhx272/aita_for_cutting_off_contact_with_my_dad_after_he/) in r/AmItheAsshole so I guess this is kind of an update and kind of a rant. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been with my Fiance for 7 years (8 years in August) since we were 18 years old. We got engaged in September 2018 and had an engagement BBQ. This was the first time that Future MIL and my dad have met. Fiance doesn't get along with his mom and I don't get along with my dad so they were never at the same function at the same time until now. Well they had sex in our guest room at our engagement party. 

&amp;#x200B;

The week after they got married. We decided to try and accept it because we don't see them often and it doesn't really affect us. We did think it was super weird though. We went to breakfast with them and suddenly they were introducing us to everyone as brother and sister. We didn't really talk to them again until they invited themselves other to Christmas. My dad, MIL, sister and fiance's sister are all staying the night Christmas eve. Fiance and I try to go to bed and MIL starts talking about how nice it is that all the siblings are having a sleepover. When we refused to have our sisters in the room with us, she started screaming about how we are disobeying God, 

&amp;#x200B;

After that MIL refused to let Fiance see his little sister until we were broken up. So we ""Broke up"". I have been staying with his dad temporarily (who has been super supportive, there are some truly good people in the world). There is a court case coming up this Thursday over custody of his little sister and if all goes well we will be back to living together soon and his little sister will be living with her dad. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also plot twist (kinda): My sister called me and apologized about her comments (see AITA post), and told me that my father and MIL only got married so she would have a better shot at custody. So both my sister and I have agreed to testify on behalf of my Fiance's sister to the abuse that went on in our house growing up (Lawyer decided not to use my sisters testimony but it was nice of her to offer). 

&amp;#x200B;

After all is said and done, we plan to move across the country.  Though I am not quite sure how yet, moving across country seems like a big task.",JUSTNOMIL
"I put rant advice wanted- I wish there was a flair that said ""support"" wanted because I'm here for the affermitive pats. Mama bear hormones are taking off and DH is at work and while he accepts I was right I have no direct support right now. 

Not sure where we left off.. I think it was mothers day, she invited 100 week pregnant me + kids + dh to her house for mothers day in bum-fuck middle of nowhere. 

So, little BEC things began happening. She sent DH that ""you dont love me text"" then apologised kinda to him.. then invited us down for memorial day, so set the scerne: BIL and SIL and their two kids would be there, their preteen/teen kids (2) plus DH, myself, and 3 kids. Plus FIL and MIL. They have 3 bedrooms total, with only two available beds. SIL won't sleep in their camper which uncomfortably slept 2 of our kids plus DH and I the last memorial day we spent there (and probably conceived DD) 
Add on top that ALL their beds are equal to plywood, I have a bad back on top of being 125 weeks pregnant despite being a yankee who cowers at any temp above 80 when not baking, its the south- so it was over 100' all weekend there. 
And of course all the hate and rage that is pent up in me. 

So yeah, DH declined very quickly because aside from all that, DS2 was having a bad time recovering from ""minor"" surgery and we needed to be close to a hospital for him, let alone me. He didnt tell her that, just we had plans already. He was in no mood to hang out at the a/c-less farm regardless of everyone's health. 

So, that was Friday before memorial day. Tuesday one of her friends, from her hometown tries to friend request me. Now since I deleted my post history let me remind you she used her sister's fb page to spy on me, she used her mothers facebook to spy on me, she has asked my husbands cousins if she could spy on me through their pages.. The person in question who friend requested me did NOT request my husband. Just me. So, I promptly blocked the requester. 

I told DH the other night she's ramping up. She went 3 weeks (easter to mothers day) before inviting us down, then two weeks for the next invite, 3 days between invite to friend request and a week now for the call to my mom. Today. 

My mom said Snag-Hag called her up asking questions to which she kept telling snag-hag ""you need to ask your son about that"" and changing the subject. My mom just had surgery so she focused more on her own (JNwoes) than MIL's questions. According to my mom it wasnt long, and she's already let my grandmother know MIL is on the prowl for info and reminded her that she can talk about anything but the kids and I. 

When I informed DH (via picture of the voicemail my mom left while I was cleaning my car) I just said ""fuck your mom, and I told you so, I told you so, I told you so, I told you so"" 

He can't talk so I got emjoi's back. I'm interpreting  as he doesn't like the fact that I'm right, but OF COURSE is so surprized she did that. 

I'm just trying to figure out what her next move is. I'm due in July, that is all she knows. So I could see the pattern tightening of her trying to get info after contact at Easter. I don't think she would drive out here, its 3 hours and all... but god knows what goes through the minds of these people. 

We switched hospitals/providers recently and will probably have an induction again so security wise for the baby and I, I feel good. My other mom will be here so the kids will be protected. I'm just waiting for that other shoe to fall from the sky.",JUSTNOMIL
"TDLR just sharing some daily MGG crazy for you 

I have been passively and jokeing pointing out the daily insanity of MonsterGiaGia (MGG) to my husband and he is waking up from the fog. 

Like “oooo you didn't call your mom today and report our daily movements shes gonna get mad at you”

Or if he does call... i just mouth “codependency” at him and wink. 

Sometimes I think it’s me, that she has smothered us to the point where even normal interaction is too much for me. And I am just like “no” But then I reflect on her behavior and am like nope... she is actually the problem. 

I have also made him supervise the baby when she is around. He is waking up to her crazy and no longer suggest leaving the baby with her. (Winning) 

Now he is opening up about his childhood with her and the strange codependent event she has engaged in with him. 

Everyone it is Fucking crazy. 

Going to America was the best thing my husband ever did because that saved him from his mother. His brother who wants to get married and start a family never will bc of his mom. He has tried to set boundaries but he still live at home (cause his jobs is like 6 weeks away 1 week home) but a 38 yr old living with mommy just will never get a girl even in Greece. (I said this to my husband and he agreed, so he KNOWS he knows how his mother is. He just hasn’t decided to take action yet) 

Now Hubby went to university in ESSEX which is in England. 
MGG went with him. 
NOT to drop him off and get him settled and return home over the weekend. 
Like normal parents. 
Oh no MGG would never leave her first born in England at University when he’s is 18 without her. How will he survive? 
Not exaggerating. 
MGG left her husband and other son For over a month and lived in a hotel next to hubby’s university flat, which he shared with 12 girls and visited him and his roommates every day all day, cooked, cleaned and lectured his roommates for 6 weeks,,, 6 weeks!!! 

He said it was extr embarrassing because she would leave condoms everywhere and lecture his flat mats on safe sex because she thinks all the girls from Essex are sluts. 

I asked him if it occurred to him to tell her to go at the time and he said no. 

I was like your exaggerating he was like “nope 6 weeks she went to Uni with me it was awkward” 

I. Have. No. Words. 

I told him if I ever develop codependency tendencies with our daughter to step up and end it. He laughed and said well you are too independent to do that. 

She would also send by express carrier food she had cooked for him from greece to london..... 
FROM GREECE TO LONDON.
Not like once a year like once a week.
 Crazy expensive. 

Waking up from the fog is hard.
Since I have removed myself from the situation I am no Longer his mommy buffer. Thus he has to deal with her and she is smothering him. I can see it starting to annoy him because HE is bitching about her. He brings her up and he is Now talking about Boundaries. 

I have solutions for dealing with her but he needs to be willing to implement them, and he is not willing yet. He is still in the accommodate to her face and disregard as soon as she is gone phase. Which is easy when it’s just basic smothering but not good long run because we have a daughter to look out for now. 

I know what I need to do, I can’t bitch to him. I have to call her out, calmly to her face at how ridiculously she is. Sweet but firm. I am not that good at it. But I will try.",JUSTNOMIL

"Sorry this kind of became verbal/literary diarrhea. I just started writing and poured out EVERYTHING. It's a really really long post and bless anyone who makes it to the end!



So I've been doing a LOT of reflecting recently. About my own mentality and emotional state and basically taking a good hard look at how I've responded to events in the past, how I handle big events in my life (birthdays, holidays, announcements etc), but most importantly...asking myself WHY I have these knee jerk reactions and feelings about stuff/people. I realized that for starters, while Molding Myrtle is trying at the best of times- she's also not nearly as evil or malicious as I've thought her to be (more so at certain times than others). She's predominantly ditzy and she's suffered a few strokes so she's not exactly firing on all cylinders these days. And her wiring was fairly messed up to begin with. Yeah she's a JustNo in her own right...but she's not malicious. She's mostly just annoying and lonely (and that's my opinion even factoring how she turned our home into a biohazard and got our cat killed).



But it's funny how you can be asked the same kind of question over and over by multiple people before you really stop to consider it and ask yourself in earnest for the truth. I would like to thank u/vkscp for being the one to gently ask me the same question I've been asked so many times here and being the one to ask at the right time. Why I haven't gone NC with TROC? 



And as I was writing out my usual defense of ""I know how to handle her crazy. NBD"" response to this question, I started to actually ask myself WHY? And my response changed.


I admitted that I'm still wading through FOG...and the FOG is much thicker than I'd realized. I finally saw that I haven't gone NC because of Fear and Guilt. And that I almost exclusively reach out to her because of Obligation. That's a shit ton more FOG than I thought I still had! (Which I had thought was at most lil wisps...small occasions when I'd maybe tone down a reply/response) But the thing is, the FOG is thick and it's causing ripples. Ripples in how I perceive events, individuals, and causing me to have excessive hostility and suspicion around things and people that ultimately have NOTHING to do with TROC...or at least they don't HAVE too. 

For example, announcing my pregnancy. I was wildly unprepared for their respective reactions. I thought I could at least predict how TROC would react (I would put in a gif here about Mr. Incredible holding the phone away from his ear while Elastigirl screams in excitement but I can't find a gif of it) but instead she took the wind out of my sails by being all flat and the first thing she says to me is ""I kinda figured."" 


That's when I started looking back at how she's treated me during many of the big events in my life worth celebrating...birthdays, xmas/holidays, getting engaged, my wedding, and now my FIRST PREGNANCY. She's either done her damndest to A) traumatize me with either fear or sorrow, B) make it all about her and satisfying her desires or a mix of columns A and B. 

Let's go over the list shall we? (Cause I have for the last few nights now and it's been keeping me up) 

Birthdays: if she wasn't dragging us up to TN for HER to have a vacation (because she freaking loves going to TN in the fall and my birthday is in the fall. Because SHE WANTS to see the leaves change and eat her beloved maple candies. Now I don't have anything against enjoying the view of the leaves changing up in the mountains. That was one thing I actually found very pretty but that was about the only thing I enjoyed on these trips. I'm a BRITTLE TYPE 1 DIABETIC and have been since I was 3. So her fucking obsession with the thousands of flavors of FUDGE (that may be a bit of an exaggeration) and stocking up on maple candies was so blatantly about HER that it was cringe worthy. I was lucky if we stopped at a restaurant and I got a tiny slice of birthday cake which was about the only sweets I was permitted if I was active enough during the day (I wasn't allowed my own cell phone and even if I was this was before data plans were common so you'd have to pay for internet usage and well, looking up carbs for whatever food item/dish just wasn't really a thing yet). Happy fucking birthday to me.

Or we'd all stay home and she'd find some way to taint the day. 

Typically ""forgetting"" about defrosting my requested cheesecake (I gave up asking her for birthday cakes as she's a terrible cook. Otherwise my Gma would make me a beautiful and decadent chocolate cake usually with vanilla icing bc that was my favorite flavor combo. And she was a true gourmet chef and trained cake decorator). If it wasn't an epic party that completely flopped (what other white than white girl has a flipping quenciñera or however you spell it?! Yeah and being like the newest new kid at school (my birthday was at like the first month of school and I had only just joined that school in the 8th grade after having been homeschooled for the last like 5 yrs). I had 2 friends show up and that was about it and one of them was actually a friend I'd recently had a falling out with whom TROC invited. (At least we could be awkwardly civil with each other). And I wound up comforting TROC because no one showed up. To. My. Birthday. Party. 

Or how on my 17th birthday she thought it would be FUNNY to put one of those life sized plastic statue figures of an an owl (the one thing I was scared shitless of and had a full blown phobia of) on my nightstand when she knew I always woke up at about 3AM on my birthdays. She found me in a shivering terror stricken mess on the couch that morning. I was in the throes of shock and a panick attack. Happy fucking birthday to me. 


20th birthday she reminds me of my dead uncle by switching the topic to how she trampled all over her sister's NC to go ""pay her respects"". 

30th birthday she she makes it all about how she feels old and reminds me of how she always ""joked that I shouldn't  have a birthday that yr"" every year. 

Every xmas she makes a point of saying ""happy CHANUKAH"" and refuses to ever call it xmas. Because when I was like 9yo and LB was 7yo she dictated that we wouldn't be celebrating xmas, Halloween, or Easter anymore (so instead of xmas she celebrated chanukah because she's a ""messianic Jew!"" As she's decided. Funny cause we've only ever been to synagogue a couple of times because of our actually Jewish friends. She just likes to incorporate Jewish festivities/high holiday's into our lives...because.) 

For when I announced my engagement she got excited about having a Son in law, and babbled on about how she KNEW we were destined for each other etc and how she couldn't wait to hlep plan the wedding. (I let her make the fez's and now ties. Gave her several months to a year before the wedding and in the video of us getting ready for and of course the actual wedding you can see her sitting like lump on the couch STILL MAKING THE FLIPPING BOW TIES hours before I'm to walk down the aisle.) 

And about a month before I actually got married is when she decided it would be a good time to tell me that her brother, my only blood uncle on her side had died. She had recently found out herself and I get it it sucks but we had been NC with the lot of them for about a decade at that point ...and he'd died at least 3 months prior to us finding out so it bloody well could have waited. 


These are just some of the celebratory events she's tainted. She gets mad if I don't tell her big news first but she destroys the moment in some way. So I don't want to tell her anything anymore. I've realized that she's an emotional vampire. 

And I'm gonna need a lot of therapy to deal with my severely messed up emotional map. 


I was being abused by my ex for years emotionally and it was quickly escalating to full on physical abuse. I found the courage and the opportunity to leave but I was terrified and *I didn't think I could ask for help because she would either say NO or hang it over my head till the day I died* and I couldn't swallow that being my future. I was literally faced with the choice between DEATH or GUILT and felt that death at the hands of my ex while painful would be quicker than the slow torturous death by a thousand paper cuts guilting I would face at the hands of my Mother. 


Because everytime I'd ever needed help, it was just one more chain she added to yank me by. She would guilt me with it and hang it over my head for years to come. That's why I always hated asking for help of any kind. 


Of course that doesn't stop her from finding something to nettle me with even if I don't ask for help. 

Like how she loves to point out the ""many ways I'm **just like her**"" most of which, I've realized are because she shoved me down a path that would force me to be ""just like her"". Being involved in dance teams during my youth? Free church ran babysitting basically and another feather in her cap of grooming me to be her perfect replica. (I enjoyed dancing but I wanted to be able to Express myself. I wanted to take tap dancing lessons not be in the ""interpretive dance youth group""). And living in [state] for some years ""just like her"" was not by choice. She black bagged me out there. I never wanted to live out there to begin with. The fact that my husband and I have the same age difference as TROC and my dad is pure coincidence. I always said I'd never date younger men, I was only interested in older guys! Well fate had other plans. Turns out older guys weren't even remotely interested in me and in the end my husband is absolutely perfect for me in every way and has been madly in love with me since we met at church camp as kids. So who cares if he's 4yrs younger than me? That was really only a hang up for me BECAUSE OF TROC. 
(I admit I always loved TROCS wedding pics with my dad...the costume wedding idea always struck me as fun and she always talked about how much fun everyone had. So we had a Geek themed/costume wedding...that almost no one wore a costume for. It was still fun) 

So yeah any life choices that I actually made of my own volition that even slightly resembled TROC'S choices, she accredits to herself and me being her clone. All the others are ones she either strong armed me towards or shoved me into. 


I always felt like I took more after my dad. But TROC is too much of a narc to ever say that. No I'm the only daughter and I look sooOOoooOOoo much like her! Ergo I must be her little clone! (Newsflash TROC, LB is the one who is most like her. Not me.) 

But she's made it such a mantra that even LB echoes it. (I don't blame him...it's hard to reprogram the brainwashing when you KNOW about it). 




And I've realized, she's never going to change. She will forever be this emotional vampire who feeds on the joy and contentment of others. She will forever crow her opinions and beliefs as loud and obnoxiously as she can because she wants to beat you/her victims into submission. She'll continue to give MLM shit as gifts regardless of what the reciever wants/needs. She can and will betray your trust if it will get her enough attention. Or she'll use your news like a knife in your back that she can twist further by completely ignoring you.

And I've been asking myself, do I really want to continue enduring this treatment and emotional abuse? And furthermore, do I want to subject my child to this kind of toxicity? I didn't really have the choice growing up but I'm an adult now. Happily married and with a child on the way. I have my own life, my own family, and soon we'll have our own home. 

I think it's time I start packing up the things I can't stand to leave behind in this metaphoric inferno and start laying some ground work (for myself) to go NC. I think I'm at the point of setting of this bridge on fire. Basically I'm pouring the gas and setting the hay, so all I have to do is strike the match. (Which at this exact moment, not wise. But I'm making my plans for escape)

"It's been 2 years since I went NC (VVVVVLC for DH) with Boo-Hoo and FIL. Before that time, we let them know that while we weren't shutting the door on them forever, we would have no further communication until they acknowledged the hurt their actions have caused. We were mocked, with Boo-Hoo texting DH with such nonsense as ""You don't want to go 10 years without talking to your family"" and ""When you stop being so over-sensitive we'll be here to talk.""

.... Is this her way of saying she won't acknowledge anything she's done for a MINIMUM of 10 years? She thinks he'll come crawling back to her, kissing her feet and begging her forgiveness. And it blows my mind that she STILL doesn't understand that DH isn't NC with his entire family. Part of the propaganda she spread after we put our boundaries in place was that DH was abandoning the entire family. Then why is he still communicating with his other relatives? The only ones we stopped communicating with were the ones who hurt us.

Well, we've been planning a move thousands of miles away for the last year or so. We talked with our therapist about whether or not to break NC to tell them, but she suggested if they haven't changed to wait and see if they reach out with a genuine apology first. I put my resignation in with my job in preparation for next month's move, and knew it would get back to Boo-Hoo, as we work for the same company and she directly receives the names of people leaving/retiring every year. It wasn't something I was trying to hide, and I knew it would spark her curiosity to see my name on the list.

Now, DH wanted to give her one last chance to come clean and own up to her part in the drama since our engagement. On the advice of our therapist, he reached out via email to let her know that he would be willing to reopen a tentative communication with her through written means only, (since gaslighting is her preferred manipulation tactic and she won't be able to deny what she's written in black and white). He said he wanted to get everything in the open so we can all begin healing, but that it won't happen without honest communication.

 She excitedly agreed, then proceeded to write him a 2 page email about her neighbors, her dogs, and her health issues. Absolutely nothing about what he'd mentioned. He responded as much, telling her there would be no casual conversations until the issues at hand were resolved. She still hasn't responded to that.

Then she saw I was resigning my position.

All of a sudden she's blowing up DH's phone with texts asking ""Is anything's wrong??"" I can HEAR her hopefulness in her words. 

See, she desperately clings to the notion that DH and I were doomed from the day he proposed to me. FIL has been stoking the fire on that dream, saying that DH will ""come to his senses"" and that they just have to ""wait it out."" As in... waiting for us to divorce. So somehow Boo-Hoo thinks my resignation has something to do with the state of our marriage.... 🤔

DH hasn't responded to her inquiries yet... but we need to think of a way to tell her that we won't be sharing any personal details of our lives until she responds to his email. She's just refusing to acknowledge anything she thinks unpleasant.

Any and all advice on this matter would be appreciated. I hope she decides a relationship with her son is more important than her pride. As much as I dislike her, it would make me very sad if we moved away before trying to reconnect at least one more time for my DH's sake. He's been so good about maintaining our boundaries and sticking up for me.",JUSTNOMIL
"(EDIT- I was corrected in the comments that what I made was actually called ""cottage pie"" becaude I used beef, so I changed it!)
(EDIT 2- after encouragement in the comments I posted the recipe in r/JUSTNORECIPES! Just look for Irrational Irene in the title)

Well, you guys seemed to like the story of how MIL tried to ruin our wedding, so maybe you will like this gem too. 

This happened  few months before DH and I were married (before the guest list debacle). My FIL decided to take a three week trip to Australia to visit a relative. He made DH and SIL promise to visit her while he was gone so she wouldn't be so lonely. Ok, fine. DH and I set up a day to go over the next week. I told her i would cook so she wouldn't have to. Everything seemed fine. She asked me what I was going to make and I told her I would make my Gramma's cottage pie. It is a unique recipe (honestly thought it had died with her, but luckily someone had kept the recipe for when one of her grandkids asked for it), and it takes about three and a half hours to cook. It is one of DH's favourite meals. I made the mistake of telling her this.

20 MINUTES BEFORE WE ARE SET TO GO OVER THERE (so 3 hours of cooking later) I get a phone call from her and she is SOBBING. Like I need to ask her to calm down blubbering. She finally managed to tell me that she had been asking EVERYONE SHE KNOWS for a full week why my cottage pie takes 3 hours to cook, and no one has the answer! And that the recipe SHE has can be made in 20 mins flat. She is terrified of my cottage pie! I tell her no one else knew the answer because it was a recipe my Gramma had created herself, and I would have told her how it was made if she had just asked me herself, and proceeded to tell her. 

You'd think that would have calmed her, but nope! She began to cry again and say that since she didn't know what meat I used in it, how could she eat it? For all she knew I used goat or bison or something weird like that! Again, i told her that if she had just asked me i would have assured her I used ground beef (in deference to her too. I usually use ground turkey). At this point I knew that she was just looking for an out so i told her if she didn't want it, that was fine.

Well, she got huffy and told me that no, she didn't want it and had only agreed because we made the plans in front of FIL and she ""didn't know how to say no"". So DH and I just stayed home and ate the rockin cottage pie ourselves. Hey, at least she spared us a few hours of her drunken conversation!

In honour of this story, I think I'm going to nickname MIL ""Irrational Irene""!",JUSTNOMIL
"So my JNOMIL aka The Red Queen (see last post) dropped a scatter bomb on DH and I yesterday when we met with her to drop off stuff from her storage. 

She let us know she wants a spare bedroom cleaned out of our storage so she can have a bed delivered because she wants to start coming up and spending a few days at a time to “get away from everything” which I understand and we understand it’s her house she can do what she wants. However, why now? Why after so many years of us living here has she suddenly decided let’s do sleep overs. We both found it odd but DH doesn’t seem to think there’s an ulterior motive but I do! 

Maybe because of all the shit that’s gone on in the past I’m already in defense mode or maybe I’m on to something. All I know is that I don’t trust her alone with my personal belongings and she refuses to set a date she plans on doing this and she also wants a day for home inspection and clean up within the next 2 weeks. I want an actual date/time so I can remove any items I’m concerned about her “claiming” from the house. She has “claimed” things before and DH had to make her give them back once I provided proof in years old photographs that had the items in them, well before I met DH or her. 

I just don’t get though why she constantly wants to cause stress and anxiety I just don’t! I got along with her in the beginning and I wish we could go back to that. How do I make her realize I’m not taking her “baby” away when all I do and have done was look out for his best interest. It’s not my fault she was the one pulling shady shit on him. I know I sound like a bitch but I would have pointed these things out regardless to protect him. 

Any ideas on how I can make this new venture as smooth and stress free as possible without alerting her I’m preparing because all that will do is up the antics. Thank you all in advance!

"Hey, long time no post.

I finally got away from my JNMom Spare Key. I had a false start trying to leave. But finally, shit worked out and I moved in with my best friend. I didn't leave a not I just walked right fucking in her room and told her like a woman. 

Her reaction was pathetic. She kept telling me that me moving out would literally kill her. That she had congenital heart failure and she would die. That what was her purpose if she couldn't help me thrive? I was so fucking done at that point, it rolled off me. 

This woman must've forgotten she recently slapped me for spilling water and bumping into her. Or any of the other times she went completely bat shit on me. 

The clincher? She was listening in on me while I was talking to my friend. She accused me of saying I wanted her to die?? Bitch! I said me moving was not going to kill her. 

It's like dealing with a dramatic ex girlfriend I swear...

Anyways, she pause my cellphone service. Whatever, I found my way. And I'll get new cellphone and wash my hands of it.

So MIL is coming to stay with us for the weekend. Whenever she comes she is generally unhelpful expects us to cook for her and always asks for white wine ( as in drinks two bottles a night asks for more every day doesn’t buy any herself etc) I don’t drink white wine and neither does DH.  In the past I have been nice and go out of my way to stock up for her because she asks for it. When we visit her she never has any drinks that we like just what she wants. She arrives tomorrow and I have no white wine in the house as of yet. Tomorrow when she asks for it I plan on saying oh we aren’t drinking during the week so I don’t have any on hand unless DH picked some up...then turn to DH with a questioning look. When he says no I’ll say well MIL you can pick up what you want tomorrow at the store then. Problem is I am already starting to cave and think I should go get a bottle.

"Trigger Warning - traumatic birth

4.5 years ago our beautiful baby boy was born. After a long labour and many complications, I bled out. I had surgery to stop the bleeding but suffered ‘multiple organ failure requiring full resuscitation’. I woke up the next day on a ventilator. 

My Mum sat with my son in the NICU so my DH could stay with me in ICU. I found out later from my parents that when my MIL arrived, she told my Mum that she was taking her son home now and steered him out. I’ve never fully forgiven my DH for leaving with her but I do understand he was tired and shocked. When the poo hit the fan, he was told to take my son and stand in the corner. The last he saw me was while I was being wheeled out at a run with my OB on top of me doing compressions. He was left alone in that room for over 2 hours with our son and 3 liters of my blood on the floor. So I can’t really be mad at him for listening to his Mum (but maybe I’m a little bitter). 

My MIL didn’t care that I albeit briefly, died that night. That the Dr’s barely got my son out in time to save him. She didn’t care that her only (at the time) grandchild was in the NICU and almost lost his mother. This women has done a lot to me over the years but this event will always stick out to me. My Mum wouldn’t leave my sons side until I could be with him. She changed his nappies, fed him his first bottle, bonded with the NICU Mums, all while fearing for her own daughters life.

"Just a reminder that Thorn is my JNMom, nn Thorn because she is named after a flower but resembles more like the thorns of the flower than the actual flower.


Yesterday one of my nephews graduated HS. It was nice and lots of family members came. After the graduation, everyone went to this popular pizza place and my sister had one side of the restaurant (split by wall and doorway) closed off only to guests of my nephews graduation. There was like 20 people.

Anywho, my other nephew (age 3), is being potty trained by my sister who is sometimes JN. 

Earlier this week, my sister sent a text to Thorn and I about nephew having a successful day of potty training. Apparently he even pooped in the toilet a few times and to be funny, sent us a picture of it. It was gross and I honestly didn’t even look at it. I actually scolded my sister and said it was disgusting although I was happy for nephew. 

My DH accidentally saw it too when I opened the text and he was like WTF. My sister can sometimes be a bit trashy so we chalked it up to that but still agreed it was gross and not cool.

Anyways, yesterday while everyone was eating at the graduation party, Thorn, while everyone was talking, began to brag about nephew (her grandchild) being potty trained. Nephew was sitting near her and she suddenly began going through her texts. 

In my mind I was thinking “this lady can’t be looking for that poop pic”... yup... she finds it, enlarges and shows the family/guests at our table. My brother was super embarrassed but my nephew who was there was super proud and beaming so no one really wanted to say “that’s gross out that away”, since nephew was super proud but people were like ... awkwardly laughing but super grossed out. 

It doesn’t end there. I told Thorn is was gross and said what are you doing... well she shouts to the next table where graduating nephew is at and shows his table with all his friends who are all mortified and shocked. She then gets up and goes to table by table and shows everyone. Idk WTF she was doing. In my head it seemed like she wanted the attention and people were grossed out. 

She was announcing “Look (nephews name), made a BIG POOP in the toilet! Aren’t you guys proud???”

This lady is not dumb (I mean she is but ), she is a working professional and even holds up a reputation, at least at work. It wasn’t like she didn’t know this was not ok. 

Idk why she did it but the incident keeps playing in my head. I was super embarrassed. I was just telling my friend the other day that I didn’t want my family to mix with my friends and in laws for DDs first birthday party in Sept because my parents are JN and they do things that make me cringe. This is one of the things that make me rethink even having them around. 

I really don’t even want to have 3 separate parties for DD though (friends, family and In-laws). I did this for my baby shower and it was exhausting to keep everyone separate. I can’t keep this up forever but i can’t imagine the embarrassment of Thorn doing this around friends and in-laws. 

I’m seriously disgusted.",JUSTNOMIL
"Couple of issues to try to address here. My wife recently disclosed to me that her mother physically punished (""assaulted"") her and her two brothers well past a normal age and even into their early 20s while they lived at home. She called them whuppings but basically it sounds like they were still spanked even as young adults. I hate to use the word spanked because it sounds dirty to me which is what makes this even weirder. She is very low contact with her mother now and hates that she allowed this to happen to her and her brothers. She feels partially responsible because she's the oldest and feels like she should have stopped her mother but felt like there was no other option at the time other than dealing with it or moving out. To her credit, that's probably pretty true. I've tried to make her feel better but it was pretty strange for me to hear and I find it difficult to tell her that it wasn't that abnormal. It's one of the most abnormal things I've ever heard (would never say that to her of course). I've suggested therapy which I think she will take advantage of but I'm not sure how else to console her about this. She was raised in the 70s and 80s in Texas so there's part of the old school discipline mentality at play but I still feel like there was something more to it with her mother. I wish I could one - make my wife feel better and two - find out what the hell her mother was thinking to treat her grown children that way.",JUSTNOMIL
"This is an old story. I could use some advice.
So as I stated previously when dh was 18 he had to cut off life support for his father as mil refused. Fil would have been a potatoe if he survived. Continuing without future abbreviations but I'm not married. Also I have a daugther.

Dh and I were friends previously. After agreeing to go on a date a ""friend"" of the family warned me about the family. This person mostly warned me about sil and a little about mil. Within a week of dating fdh is spending lots of time with me at my apartment. That is why the fight started.

First mil smack sil for her attitude. Girl only gets punished once a year for the horrendous things she does. Then she went in on bil as he is an easy target in his 20's and plays d&amp;d all day. He fell for a scam recently as well. I tried to get dd out of situation and in dh car. That sent mil into a bigger furry. She yelled at dh to get in her room, he obliques. 

So that was when it happened. She yelled at him for hurting sil and causing her to be hurt. All because he was dating me. She told dh that he is choosing the wrong path and he was going to lose his family. Dh reminded her that he was trying to start his own family. He got the most used line that he recieves from mil what happens if I die. Who is going to look after your brother and sister. That clearly didn't work. That was when she stated that he had no right to have his own family as he killed fil. Dh left and stayed at my place for a couple of days. He was a wreck.

Mil held a family meeting and apologised (she never does that). She promised she wouldn't do it again (which she hasn't). She has used this before to mak dh do her bidding. Mil and sil look at dh as if he owes them this role, as if his life should revolve around them. It's a never ending war.",JUSTNOMIL
"I am white American, my fiance is Indian. We are planning a blended wedding, which feels as though it has been overtaken by the Hindu/Indian side of things. Difficulties and cultural barriers aside, we finally began making some headway on planning and I said yes to my dream dress last weekend (a lovely blush lacy, sparkly a-line with a sweetheart neck and off the shoulder straps). I sent my fMIL pictures and didn't hear back from her.

&amp;#x200B;

I eventually mentioned this to my fiance, and he recommended that I just call her and chat -- we generally get along, despite her constant complaints that my fiance and I need to lose weight (we are both on the chunky side, but still very much healthy and active). I called her today, and was met with little enthusiasm. ""Oh, so that's what you picked; the sleeves like that? You will have to change for the reception because Indian men will be there"". Unless I grossly misunderstood her (English isn't her first language), she told me I should change out of my wedding dress to not offend the gaze of our male Indian guests. Not to mention, she wanted to make sure I ordered the right size for ""when \[I\] lose weight"".

&amp;#x200B;

I changed the subject and avoided the discussion. I was just shocked and disappointed. I really do love this lady -- she includes me in every event, she handpicks clothes from India for me, and has shown me how to make so many dishes. But I can't help but feel a little gutted. Yet another thing she doesn't like about me or who I am. My dress is by no means revealing, and even a little conservative by American standards. I'm definitely not changing out of my dress. It's my wedding, and I will wear that dress if virtually nothing else goes my way.

"DD hit a monthly age milestone yesterday. I generally don't post pictures of her throughout the month but do a monthly update due to being so busy. I work full time and typically pick up DD after work between 5-6, go home, cook dinner, clean up, and DH gets home between 7:30-8:30. So I don't really have time to do anything phone wise until late at night when DD and I go to bed. Last night around 9:20 I posted an update that she was x amount of months with about 10 pictures of her over the last month. MIL made her happy x month post at 8 that morning. Whatever, I'm over it. She has always asked me to tag her in all my posts with DD. I don't because she's not in the pictures and I tag my husband because he is and it's his child. 

Well, someone showed her how to download pictures from Facebook because not 20 minutes after I made my post she made another post for the day on her timeline with about 5 of the pictures I just posted...and she tagged me and DH in them. Not 20 minutes after that she creates another ""oh I just love my grandchild so much"" post with pictures that I've posted since she was born....and again tags me in them...my own pictures. 

Setting aside that she constantly posts the most ridiculous barf worthy posts and  DH and I are professionals with friends with many colleagues on Facebook. I feel like last night was a real underhanded violation. Because I wasn't tagging her like she wants she felt the need to repost my pictures to her timeline and tag me in them. Idk why it bothers me so much but it does.

Part of me was like welp, I'm done with Facebook. But then I don't want to have to get rid of something I enjoy because she is obsessed and manipulative. I don't want to hurt her feelings or cause a giant problem over stupid social media posts because it feels dumb to even be mad about it. Has anyone else had these kinds of issues? How did you handle it with an overbearing MIL? Anyway to stop this without causing a war? Instagram maybe? Lol",JUSTNOMIL
"So I forgot to change my address from when I was living with MIL. I got an email the other day that my bank was shutting down my old card and that I needed to activate my new one. I called them and it turns out that my new card had been sent to MIL’s place but she has not said a word to SO about it. So I asked him to call her and she said “she would check” so she did and she said my new card “wasn’t in the current mail” which I take to mean she doesn’t have any of my mail. I know I should have changed my address, but it pisses me off to know that she’s either a- throwing my mail away or b- holding onto it but choosing not to say anything to SO. But I have a STRONG feeling it is the first one. Am I wrong for being mad? I know it’s my fault but I just feel like if you’re still getting my mail from my bank you should have brought it up to SO. the people who bought our old house still text me when they get important looking mail for us, and my MIL literally can’t even be bothered. 
EDITED TO ADD. I already changed all my info over with my bank and got a new card.",JUSTNOMIL
"ETA: Dammit! The title was supposed to be WTAF! Also, I want to add that I really want to get my stuff out of her house. I’m just venting because it’s all she ever talks to me about, and it’s starting to be a daily and repetitive conversation. I’m limited by injury and illnesses and I need help, which they won’t provide. I need help getting rid of the stuff in my garage in order to fit what I need to remove from her house.

&amp;#x200B;

Holy hell of an update, Batman! This ended up being long because I transcribed most of the text messages. I flaired this as no advice wanted, but thoughts or suggestions are always helpful. tl:dr at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m at a loss for words. This is really confusing, so I’ll try to be as short and as clear as possible, but damn my family is wackadoodle to say the least. The ONLY reason I can remember all the details is because most of it is through texts or with FDH on speakerphone. (Thanks, y’all! I’ve learned to document even though I’m not in any physical danger, it’s helped me keep my sanity being able to refer to what’s been said.

&amp;#x200B;

This is about my mom, Mommasaurus Rex, and her [pushing me out of the house,](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/bwxbs0/mammasaurus_rex_in_moving_shenanigans/) and how she is triangulating between me, FDH, and ALL 3 of my NBros + SIL.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple days ago I get this text from SIL (NBro1’s wife):

&amp;#x200B;

“Hey family!

I think everyone’s on this thread :) NBro1 and I are going to take a huge scary leap and try out a different state. We need a different pace of life and a little adventure. We are super sad to leave family and have such mixed emotions about it.... But we are moving in

August  to \[Southern East Coast City that hurricanes almost always hit.\] We are keeping our house here in \[Common Southwest Coastal Vacation Destination\] so that we can come back if we feel it was a mistake to move.

I’m feeling sad just texting this :(

I hope you will come visit :)

We will be coming back for 2-3 weeks during Xmas and 4-6 weeks in the summer... and NBro1 will be flying back to \[West Coastal City\] twice a month for work....”

&amp;#x200B;

Eight hours later, SIL sends another text pleading for attention and doing her best to guilt us into replying about how we are all besides ourselves with grief and crying into our pillows. Nope, not today, satan! But of course, as we all know how emotionally unstable most Narc Mils can be, MR starts sending over the top “we’re crying in our beer” texts at an alarming rate. After about 30 minutes of it, I removed myself from the group.

&amp;#x200B;

Two hours later, MR texts me.

&amp;#x200B;

MR: Hey let’s just be honest. You’re living with FDH. NBro1 and SIL will need to stay at our house this summer before they move in August. We will need to use your room. Are you still wanting to keep your bed? You can get a storage unit since y’all can’t fit everything in your house yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: You know I live here. I’ve told you, umpteenth times. I’ve also told you I can’t afford and will not spend money on a storage unit, so please stop suggesting it. If y’all want to help we’ll get it done faster. I am confused though, because they said they’re (NBro1 and SIL) keeping the house.

&amp;#x200B;

MR: I’m not sure what’s going on. It changes from day to day lol

&amp;#x200B;

Me: That doesn’t sound like a tentative situation based on what you just said.

&amp;#x200B;

MR: I just need you to move your things out.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Yeah, I got that.

&amp;#x200B;

Last night MR called and I’ve mostly been avoiding her, but I know if I didn’t answer, she’d just kill my soul slowly with hundreds of guilt tripy texts. I put her on speaker with FDH next to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: I only have a few minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

MR: \*slowly kills my soul anyway\*

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially, she tells me that NBro2 broke up with his live-in girlfriend and he’s going to move into my room until August, so I have to move out this weekend and take the couple pieces of furniture and the 2 boxes of kitchen wear out of the garage or I could get a storage unit. JFC, woman. How many times do I have to tell you?  I need to wait to do that with FDH and I’m not getting a storage unit! I asked what happened to NBro1 and SIL needing my room for the summer. She says she doesn’t know. I asked her if she had talked to NBro2 about all of this and she said no.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point FDH signals to me he wants to say something. He says that I need help. She can’t expect me to do any moving until he has some free time. If MR, NDad, and Nbro2 want to help we could have it done faster. FDH has his very own JNMom, so when she tried to guilt him, he shut that shit down. He also told her that we already let her know that we don’t want the bed and matress, so they can move them out of the room to speed up the process. We will not be moving any of the furniture this weekend, but we would most likely be by Sunday. She said just as long as it’s out by “summer” she’ll be happy. I remind her that she’s been saying that for the past 4 months and it’s June. It’s already “summer.” She said by August will be fine. Ok, cool, so right in time for when all the siblings no longer need my room. Ugh. I tell her I have to go and she said she does too, but then spends the next several minutes going into an unrelated work story. FDH talks over her and ends the call.

&amp;#x200B;

FDH says we should text Nbro2 to make sure there is a clear understanding of what will transpire this weekend and he wants to see if he can get him to do the bulk of the work since I had to clean out his old room when I moved back in to recover from surgery.

&amp;#x200B;

I am, at this point so fucking annoyed with her that I hand my phone to FDH and tell him to have at it, and just don’t say fuck too many times. We make a bet on what he’ll say and here it is: (I won the bet, lol)

&amp;#x200B;

Me (FDH): Hey bro, I just talked to mom. She said you were gonna move back in with them. That sucks, I hope you’re ok. I’m assuming she said you’ll take my room since she told me to clear my stuff out, but I just wanted to check in with you and then figure a timeline.

&amp;#x200B;

NBro2: I think if you do it this weekend that would be awesome Thanks Aspienonomous! Ya everything is ok. Just didn’t work out it’s fine

&amp;#x200B;

Me (FDH:) Ok, we’ll try to get part of it out on Sunday. Are you going to be around to help? Mom said y’all could probably get rid of the bed and stuff I don’t have room for but we’ll try to get the things I need.

&amp;#x200B;

NBro2: Ya talk to mom what she wants you to move out I don’t know what they want. No I’m not going to be there.

&amp;#x200B;

Me (FDH:) Did you know they wanted me out before they offered you the room? She’s been on me for awhile but I can’t fucking physically do much right now, so I’ll need help. I don’t really understand your texts, they are a little... inconsistent?

&amp;#x200B;

NBro2: I’m saying I don’t know what mom needs you to do With the room but she wants you to take care of it this weekend

&amp;#x200B;

WTAF!!

&amp;#x200B;

My head, (and probably your head,) is spinning and I'm, (and probably you're) trying to make sense of all of this. FDH and I both agreed this morning that even though it's MY family and it should be MY circus, that we'll discuss ahead of time what our decisions would be and he would take over any phone call or text conversation because they don't know him, so he wants to be the meat shield because we're a united front with what we decide on, and they lose their power and control of the situation when I'm taken out of the equation.

&amp;#x200B;

tl:dr Mommasaurus Rex dictates that my room must be cleared out this weekend because my NBro1, SIL, and 3 little DNs are going to need my room.  They will be staying with them for the summer. A day later MR dictates that my room must be cleared out this weekend because now NBro2 is going to be staying in my room for the summer. None of them offer to help and I physically can't do it alone. FDH to the rescue!!",JUSTNOMIL
"TW// Suicide attempts, abuse, toxic mom.

Hi, this is my first post on Reddit ever, so sorry if I don’t format things properly or anything like that. Feel free to correct me. Just please be kind as I’m kinda going THROUGH it right now lol. 

Backstory: my mom and I don’t have a good relationship at all, period. Never have since I was a kid. She’s mentally unstable and physically disabled and she’s just got a lot of issues and problems that she copes with by lashing out at others, guilt tripping, victim blaming, etc. Unfortunately as someone who is currently unemployed (actively seeking employment, thx) its really hard for me to get out of the living situation I’m in. I’m about to be 21, graduated HS early but never finished college (trying to go back and finish, there’s a whole story behind that too). My financial situation is not good at all and I can’t afford to move out at all. If I could, I would’ve a long time ago and I would’ve gone NC. Anyways, let’s move on to the current situation. 

My mom and I had a stupid argument that blew out of proportion. I went to my room bc I was upset and didn’t want to be around her and I locked the door. 

We texted a bit and she was upset by some things I said about being displeased with living where I do (state, not the house or anything) because I thought I would’ve been out of here by this age.

She storms to my room and tries opening the door, I’m ignoring her texts bc she’s spamming me. She starts yelling at me through the door to open up. I say “please just leave me alone, I don’t wanna talk right now.” as calmly as I can. She was verbally abusive to me growing up so I have really bad PTSD from that, and she knows I don’t react well to be yelled at, at all. She continues yelling and screaming at me, I start to cry. 

This is where it gets fucked up. She tells me to unlock my door or she’s going to call 911 and say that I’m trying to kill myself. 

I’ve attempted twice in my life. Both times as a teen who was in severe distress. I haven’t attempted since, I’ve never self harmed in my entire life, I am not a suicidal person AT ALL. She knows this. She also knows that both times I attempted, it was because I couldn’t handle what her and my family were putting me through. This fucking terrifies and infuriates me. She’s threatening to have me committed against my will and lie, saying I’m suicidal when I’m not. I really need help. I don’t know what to do here. I have no proof because she said all of this to me outloud. I want to leave and have NC but that’s not possible for me right now. I’m trying to find people to stay with but I have a large dog who I won’t leave here because she hates the dog and I don’t trust that she wouldn’t try to hurt her. Please. Any advice. Anything that can help me. Sorry for the long ass post. It’s kind of a rant too I guess. 


TL;DR: mom threatening to lie to 911 and say i’m suicidal when I’m really not so that she can have me committed against my will.

" 

new user, i was pointed in the direction of this sub by a friend who's been lurking for a while. if i do anything wrong or use confusing language, please correct me. i suspect i might need to stand upon the soap box more than once and i don't want to be That User when i do. warning that this is very long and will BRIEFLY mention suicide, though not in detail.

i might make a separate post about the details of how we came to live and leave FMIL's house, but the important part for this story is just that due to circumstances not really in our control, FDW and i had to live in FDW's kid bedroom for the past year and a bit. FDW has been to the hospital twice for suicidal ideation among other mental health problems, and has been trying for disability. FMIL has always been an emotionally abusive and gaslighting old bitch, and for the almost 5 years i've been with FDW i've been treated as anything form The Evil Temptress Girlfriend to soundboard for FMIL's depressing and passive aggressive anecdotes when she was feeling chummy.

for FDW's sanity (and now my own) we moved out. the operation was a complicated one, and even when we managed, it was miserable and hot the entire two weeks we were physically moving our stuff. but we did it, and the whole time we packed, we caught nothing but flack from FMIL. she cried and whined and attempted to make us stay by saying she was old and lonely and she worried JUST SO MUCH about FDW, how would she carry on without us when she'd already 'lost' FDW once? FDW told her to stuff it, and we completed move-in with my parents around six weeks ago.

but only a week and a half after we'd gotten settled, FDW received a call from FMIL where the old bitch claimed that we owed her money to the tune of just under 600usd, the total of which was made up from some bills we were going to pay ourselves without her, and the rest from a joint account FMIL had up been paying off on her own with relatively minimal griping. we were given until the 6th of june ""or else"".  


for context, that account was meant to be for gas and groceries, and was free game for us to use so long as we did gas fill up and groceries for FILs sometimes (we did). even under that stipulation, we paid her back as we could, like we would with anything else. i suppose she figured this would 'show us' for leaving, as she KNOWS we are broke, but after a panic, a cry, and some heart-to-hearts, i convinced FDW that really all we had to worry about was the car payment (a far more manageable 225) and FMIL would have to suck it up until we could pay the rest, but that we *would* pay the rest just so she wouldn't have anything else to possibly tie us to her. if she really wanted to sue us like she was threatening, she could foot the lawyer fees and be laughed out of court for it, since there was no signed agreement for us paying her back anything at all.  


having called this bluff, i got to work doing whatever odd jobs and commissions i could get, and FDW focused on recuperating and waiting for word back on getting disability. and we were making pretty good headway when we got a call from FFIL that FMIL needed to be taken to the hospital. why he couldn't do it is a rant for another time and sub, but suffice to say FDW was worried and went without thinking too much about it. at the time, i was doing one of the aforementioned odd jobs, and towards the end of the day i check my phone to see several missed texts from FDW explaining what happened. FMIL had an abscess that was on the precipice of going septic, and the doctors determined surgery was the best route. i told her to keep me updated, and late that night FDW came back home, saying she'd need to go again tomorrow and potentially another day, and could i please be emotional support and go with her. i said yes because she was clearly exhausted and miserable, and there was a 50/50 chance FMIL was going to have complications due to the size, depth, and location of the abscess.  


FMIL wasn't terribly cooperative with the nurses, but she went in for surgery and we spend the two days at the hospital, taking breaks when other friends of the family would stop by. unfortunately, having to eat and pay for parking/gas chewed through just about all the money we'd managed to put together for the car payment, but FDW assured me that FMIL had promised to reimburse us for the trouble. why i believed this, i don't know, but i DEFINITELY didn't expect what came next.  


as an artist, a lot of my money comes in and out of paypal, i have a debit card for that account, and that's where the money i was saving for the car payment/spending on the hospital visit came from. so when i logged on to find that it had dipped about $60 into the negatives, i cursed myself for not keeping better track. i must have spent more than i realized, and that was my fault but nbd, since we were supposed to be reimbursed. but when i checked again later to make an invoice for another customer, the negative balance had dropped to 240+. i checked my history and saw many of the charges being pulled were past transfers FDW had made to me for use of my card. theses transfers came from the FMIL joint account with her, since it was easier for FDW to put money into that account, and transfer it to me than travel all the way to FMIL's house and have to ask for the account's card. so i messaged FDW and asked if she'd done anything weird, cos what else could it be?  


we come to find out, after another few hours of head scratching and the paypal balance still dropping like a lead weight, that FMIL was apparently so sick in hospital she needed us to be there and talking to nurses and doctors for her and holding her hand, but not too sick to call the bank for her and FDW's joint account, and contest *every. single. paypal transfer.* from FDW's paypal to mine. whether it had gone through to where it needed to be last month or not, whether it had actually come from the joint account's pool or FDW's own money, and well in excess of the amount she threatened us for in the first place. to add insult to injury, FMIL closed the joint account right after she pulled this shit so we 'couldn't steal from her anymore'. meaning that when i called paypal to say this wasn't right, they told me the only person who could make it go away was the person who put up the dispute, and since the account for where the disputed money came from was closed, that money is lost to limbo. forever. the old hag won't even get any of it, afaik, so i can't even have the benefit of throwing up my hands and saying ""there, you took the money we 'owed' you, we're square, leave us the fuck alone"".  


the last several weeks have been HELL trying to recover from that little bomb (managed for now, as much as it can be). as of writing this post, my paypal account is still -650.22usd and the only silver lining i feel i have on that front is that since paypal isn't a 'real' bank they can't hit me with an overdraft/neg balance fee. but now i have no way of making what little money i was with my art, because the other options for online money management and transfer aren't nearly as well known, or outright aren't available in some countries which has affected my ability to get work from out-of-country clients. FDW laid into her mom over the phone for this, and even after saying she wished she'd killed herself after all if this was how her mom was going to ruin us (she's safe and didn't mean it except in the heat of the moment, we talked), FMIL's only response was ""have you collected yourself yet?"" and acting like this is justice served to us for 'stealing' from her.  


FMIL was released from the hospital shortly after surgery, and has been getting in home assistance while she heals, but this morning FDW told me she had to go take her back because another cyst showed up and the doctors warned FMIL to return if that happened. i wasn't awake enough to tell her to stay home, let FFIL handle it since he so completely dropped the ball last time, but when i shared that sentiment earlier this afternoon over text, FDW said that she couldn't trust he'd actually do anything, and she wants to be home but is scared if she leaves that no one else will do anything and FMIL will die.  


so i guess my question to the rest of you is how do i convince my poor FDW that this is not her burden to carry and frankly, the hospital will take care of any emergencies as they come, if they come? i don't consider myself a violent person and i would punch FMIL's teeth in (if she had any left) for what she did to us. FDW is clearly suffering pretty badly of But She's My Mom syndrome, even she's expressed she doesn't want to be doing this anymore except for the aforementioned fear. i'm not good at shinying the ol spine cos i'm a magnet for shitty toxic people and have been emotionally abused my whole life as a result; i freeze up when people raise their voice or say emotionally pointed things (which FMIL is prone to do) but i feel like something's got to give. ideally i'd like to convince FDW to go NC, but i'd be willing to settle for LC if i only knew how to enforce it. h e l p.",JUSTNOMIL

"FH (26M) and I (25F) are getting married in a few months. I was hoping that the wedding planning would go smoothly considering that my parents really like him and everyone gets along well, but I was wrong. Nmom's tantrums have been increasing the closer we get to the wedding as she realizes she won't get to ""control"" me anymore. My parents are foreign and it is their belief that a woman belongs to their family unit until she is married off. Being that I am the first in the family to take that step, it has been difficult for my parents to accept this.

I am lucky in that I have the sweetest FMIL in the world. She talked to me a few weeks ago about reaching out to Nmom to plan the shower together. I told her that I would have to explain the custom to her as it is something not really done in my parents' home country, and that she can get in contact with her after that. I had an uneasy feeling about it and of course Nmom acted as expected. I simply let her know that FMIL wanted to speak to her about throwing the bridal shower together, and explained what it was. She completely flipped out at me about it, going on about how I'm such a financial burden on them because of the wedding, how I'm selfish, blah blah. I don't feel like I was being unreasonable. They're not even paying for the wedding, the shower does not have to be anything crazy and expensive, and I even offered to pay their share if it was about the money. It's not. Nmom refused to accept my offer to pay their half, and shot me down when I said I would just not have a shower. She spent the entire week after that giving me the silent treatment and being passive aggressive to the entire household.

The whole thing really upset me and I told FH and FMIL that I was uncomfortable having a shower and that I don't really want one. They couldn't understand it though and I don't want to explain the real reason as it would cause a rift between the two families. 

Some time passed and FMIL asked me yesterday if she could reach out to my mom yet. I said yes. FMIL sent a text to Nmom requesting to meet this weekend to discuss the shower. Of course, Nmom put on a front and said yes sweetly and acted like everything was ok, but has been raising hell at home. I feel guilty as if I did something really bad but I have to keep reminding myself that she's not being rational. 

I can sense another tantrum coming on and fully expect her to text me when she's at work to fight about this. I don't know what to do or how to handle her. She will be nice and cooperative with FMIL and will throw this shower, but at the same time will use it against me and make me feel guilty for it. Canceling it isn't really a possibility either. No one else involved wants to cancel it, and even if I got that to happen FMIL would likely plan something else in my honor and Nmom would be upset and turn this into a me preferring FMIL over her thing. There's just no winning this. 

How can I approach this? What's the best way for me to handle her irrational rage? NC is not a possibility at the moment.",JUSTNOMIL
"Update, rant\vent, support and encouragement welcome. Gentle advice if you’re offering any, just had a baby 6 days ago and feel extremely sensitive. Sorry for the formatting, I’m on mobile. 

Quick background, MIL acted devastated when we announced our pregnancy. She said this baby was more special than my oldest daughter. She’s been my BEC since we got engaged and it’s just getting worse. DH is supportive and understanding. 

Tonight we were going to sit down, make a list of visiting rules and decide on a time for MIL to come visit baby. We’re staying with my parents while our house is being built so there’s no room for overnight guests, her visit would be short and sour. 

Today DH got home from work and text her to let her know he was sending something to her in the mail. Her response was “so I guess that means I’m not coming up this weekend then? I need to make plans” he was very firm and reminded her, for the fourth time “we will let you know when we are ready for visitors”. I said, fine, she can wait another week if she wants to be pushy. Then we get THE text. The text to end it all on my end. The text that made DH extremely angry. He lets out a sigh and says, “well, she just put her visit off for another week”. I was shocked that he was the one to make that call, it’s usually me. Here’s the text “I’m sorry, I know you’re busy and excited but it’s not every day you have your very first grandchild”. *record scratch*. WTF did this old hag just say? First? When you claim your ex-husbands three grandsons? What about my daughter that your son is raising as his own? My daughter that he cannot wait to finalize an adoption for? 

At this point I snapped, I said “text her back and tell her she is no longer welcome here, she isn’t coming to visit. Any favoritism in any form will not be tolerated. I told you that the second she made any difference between the girls that she was done as far as I’m concerned and I meant it, I’m done with her.” He said he knew and didn’t understand why she was like this. He said he just wasn’t going to respond because he knew that she would play victim and claim she didn’t meaaaannnnn thaaaaaaat. 

I’ve been ignoring her Instagram/Facebook comments and text messages. I was already annoyed by her just because she’s my BEC but now I feel pure hatred for her. I’m a territorial person, what’s mine is mine and don’t mess with it. She messed with it and now we’re done. No redemption as far as I’m concerned, an apology isn’t sufficient and there’s no way she’ll ever change her behavior. 

TL:DR MIL is playing favorites with my children, she’s not acknowledging my first child as a grandchild, only new LO. She keeps asking about visits despite being told she would know when we are ready for visitors. I told DH I was done with her the second she made any difference between my daughters.

"Ok. So this will build on my post about vacations with this fucking woman. 

Recap: This fucking woman planned a family trip for Father's day weekend, and pressured us heavily to go. We're not going, because it doesn't work with our schedules. She planned it without asking us. 

Ok so last weekend we were all at a grad party for my niece. So we're all chatting about summer plans. It turns out MIL and FIL are taking a big trip in July. They're going to Canada. Ok. Whatever. 

Well I guess MIL is upset that were not going on the family trip so she won't see in June. And then she's going on a big trip to Canada, so she won't see us in July at all either. 

So she says: ""Well have a nice summer since it seems like we won't see much of each other."" 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂

&amp;#x200B;

now Grandma is acting like the new baby is her first grandchild, despite the fact that baby girl was adopted by her son almost 3 years ago. I find it super disrespectful, but my sister handed it with such grace I can't even be upset. Hopefully grandma isn't involved, she'll surely show favoritism to the new baby.",JUSTNOMIL
"I don't know how to put up flair, but those who do, put the flair as Rant. Thanks! :)

For those of you who aren't familiar with my mother, The Clinger, look to BitchBot for more details.

She's been in the hospital since the slapping incident. Actually, she was at a rehab facility, but apparently decided she hated it so much she lied and said she had suicidal thoughts, so instead she's in the secure wing of our local hospital.

Our lease was up at the end of January. We hadn't been able to get an apartment in time because apparently she screwed up her credit by blowing off her medical bills, not to mention all those times she called the police and fire department doesn't make her look good to potential landlords.

 Luckily, she had the foresight to rent a storage unit, and put the payment on Auto Pay. Our stuff has been there ever since. 

Thanks to a local charity, I was able to get a place to live and food stamps. Slowly, I've been getting my stuff out of it to decorate my room.

Unfortunately, thanks to the Clinger, I won't have a storage unit for very long. You see, the Clinger gave me her debt card after I just...simply stopped getting food stamps at the end of March (someone from the charity is dealing with that now). So I've been using her card to get groceries and take some money out so I don't have to go to the ATM every single time I need cash.

Apparently, the Clinger found out and simply canceled the card. I only found this out when I attempted to take out $20. When I confronted her about it when I visited her, pointing out that she now is not only going to lose her storage unit, but also I have no way of getting groceries, the rent is due soon (the charity put me in a room in a sort-of boardinghouse where they paid my rent for three months, the idea being this was enough time for me to find a job), she put my phone bill on Auto Pay and the six-month grace period for my student loans is coming up soon, she admitted to acting on impulse, but not before insisting I could still pay with her checks, which I also have. But that's a whole other rant.

And now DCF is involved. I had her call the bank about getting a new card, and apparently her bank thinks I'm committing financial abuse. This I found out when they came to my door to ask about it.

Dammit, Clinger.",JUSTNOMIL
"Throwaway account used. Written by my wife and I.

We had our first child early this year and created basic rules such as no kissing on the lips, no posting pictures in social media(baby can’t consent), no screen time(science says bad before 2 years old), etc.

About 3 months ago my mom kissed my daughter close to her lips and I reminded her not to kiss her on the lips. Instantly she kissed her on the lips. We were disgusted because 1. She was chewing gum and 2. A kiss on the lips can be very harmful and deadly to a not fully vaccinated newborn and much safer to just simply kiss them on their foreheads. We resolved this issue after about 3-4 weeks as we needed an apology and for her to meet with a psychologist as she needs to respect our wishes as parents.

about a month ago, we went to dinner at a busy restaurant with my brother and mom. My mom was feeding our newborn when some of her acquaintances who none of had seen in ten years stopped by. While I was talking to the husband. I turn my head and all of a sudden the wife is holding my baby and my wife and I look at each other in horror. Obviously we couldn’t cause a scene because this essential stranger is holding our child. I started making moves to get her back. We told my mother has irresponsible that was, the most dangerous part of holding a newborn is the passing off and someone sitting handing a baby to someone standing is dangerous especially with waiters and waitresses walking around. Plus She didn’t even ask to hold her nor were ready. This is a baby not a toy.

We were so angered by this and told her, her response was ohh I’m paying for your meal get over yourselves. I then talked to my father and told him and her that she could not hold our baby for 30 days in public aka restaurants, but could still see her and the like. She refused to see the baby at all. On Mother’s Day It was about 2 weeks later (my wife’s first) and everything seemed to be getting better even though we haven’t seen each other since the incident on her request.

The 1st thing she did upon sitting down was request to hold the baby in yet another busy restaurant. I reminded her that she can’t because she still hasn’t even acknowledged how what she did was irresponsible. She then told us that if she can’t hold the baby right then and there we should leave and if we leave we are no longer members of the family etc. We promptly left as we discussed this in advance that we need to stand our ground. (Privilege warning). She then revoked our membership to their country club, canceled my family credit card, threatened to cancel my phone, removed us from the family group chat, among other more minor items.

We then told her she cannot see her grandchild until she sees a therapist. I really want to maintain a relationship. My mom doesn’t talk to any member of her family due to issues and this I can’t talk to that whole side. She still has not seen a therapist and apparently they have been calling everywhere to get her an appointment. Are We the Assholes?

I forgot to mention but we were also threatened with being removed from the will which is worth millions....
Also ironically it is my MIL that is behaving.",JUSTNOMIL
"So, Saint Mom the Martyr's colère du jour is about Thing Not Working. She sends a garbled email which gets me to reply - she's had a stroke, is recovering, and ever her emails are aphasic at times. I call and she proceeds to have a tantrum about Thing Not Working. I listen and calmly tell her to call the Thing Not Working repair service - the business card is on the corkboard in the kitchen 1000 miles from where I am. 

No, no, no. Not good enough. 

""Okay, what do you want me to do about it?""

Tantruming escalates. 

""Mom, I'm at work. Either give me something actionable, call the repairman yourself, or sit there and scream at a dial tone.""

I can't remember what she said, but it pissed me off enough that I said, ""Wanting what you want when you want it and screaming about not getting it until someone gives it to you just to shut you up is the rationale of a toddler. Call the repairman. Bye.""

I now understand why they call this stage of life a second childhood.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi all, need advice and maybe just to be told my kids are fucking awesome.

&amp;#x200B;

My kids are not the favorites, From either set of grandparents. My family has long established that my kids come somewhere way down the line on the list, including dogs. 

&amp;#x200B;

My own mother left my infant son in a swing for her 20 minute visit so he could ""learn to be alone"". You think I didn't leave that kid alone at some point? I did. That isn't the worst example, obviously, but it's a picture. Of disinterest.

&amp;#x200B;

But that's the thing, she didn't WANT to visit, I told her to come visit. It's 12 years later and when she comes to visit now (very, very rarely, as we moved an hour away to get away from them because it hurt to be ignored) she sits at the kitchen table and talks about herself, or worse, strangers from work, for the hour she's here and goes home. Doesn't pay attention to the kids at all.

&amp;#x200B;

My latest grip comes for my MIL. I get along with her. She's lovely. But she favors the other grandchildren. She spends 5 days a week at their house, and often weekends, too. She constantly says, ""if you need help just ask!"" But seriously, she works 6 days a week for my SIL and she deserves a break! So we ask RARELY. And she does do what we ask, but again, it's out of OBLIGATION, not out of any love or affection for my kids. 

&amp;#x200B;

This morning may have been my last straw. I called and was letting her know about a birthday party for one of my kids. It was 11 am when I called. She said she was getting ready to go to the SIL's house. I said Why? (it's 11 am, those kids don't get out of school for 4 hours) She said she's going to make the beds and do the dishes and laundry, etc. I started to say But, MIL,.... and I STOPPED! I didn't say BUT WHY?? WHY do you go 4 hours early to be their slave? Also, she needs shoulder surgery. But she's doing her own stuff AND my SIL's. Did I mention she's 80?

&amp;#x200B;

So I tell her about the party and get off the phone. I didn't question, I didn't beg, nothing. Because nothing helps. My hubby has spoken to her NUMEROUS times. She gets mad at HIM for pointing out the disparity. I SWEAR TO GOD it's not a 95/5 split in attentions. It's really more like 98.5/1.5%. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so mad. Angry. Hurt. Furious. I KNOW it's their loss, I KNOW I can't force it, but goddammit my kids are awesome! And they fucking deserve some attention. My husband is also furious and hurt and suffers bouts of depression over it. He has said he's ready to move away from them, too.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and she said she'd get him a gift card. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do the other kids get gift cards? NO! She shops and finds them the most perfect things they want. Because she knows. Because she asks. Because she talks to them.

I guess that's my rant. Sorry so long. I have years worth of shit to unload, but I really think I'm done.",JUSTNOMIL
"Just a rant but advice/ funny commentary/petty ideas are always welcome!

We are planning to drive up next week for my SILs high school graduation on wednesday. Being that its over a 12+ hour drive one way, we can't leave DS with a friend/sitter. My MIL flew in from Japan this past weekend and keeps calling D(ear)H EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. Im talking multiple times a day... Everytime she does dh puts the phone on speaker and she slips saying she really wants HIM coming up then back tracks and says oh i mean everyone insert (hard eye roll). She keeps making nasty backhanded comments practically  begging my husband to leave me home and to take our son with him, which is a **HARD PASS.** she knows she's not aloud near our son, to touch or hold him. Not only has she made this graduation stressful on sil, she's demanding we stay in the same ( read **$400/night)** hotel. Sadly its completely booked... haha!

Also the icing so far on this is she is demanding her siblings who live 2+ hours away with day jobs, take off all week, come see HER, cook for HER, take HER to an amusement park.... Because she flew allllll the way out here, for ***FREE!!!!*** no mention from her for them to come spend time with SIL, cause ya know thats the person who is being CELEBRATED for **GRADUATING!** At one point she literals said she's not going to see anyone, they have to come to her...acting like she's damn royalty and everyone else are starstruck peasants....

"TRIGGER WARNING: Mention of animal abuser and talk of PTSD

I never, ever post on reddit. This stuff is my wife's thing. She follows this thread because my mom is a narcissist, who along with my step dad, psychologically, emotionally, physically and financially abused me. I find myself in the odd position to need to vent about HER mom. I am so sorry if I am not redditing properly, this is my first time. So, I'm autistic and visually impaired, just to put some perspective to our story. 
    It had been a long week for everyone, we were all a little snappy and on edge. On days I'm off work, I help my wife babysit her siblings. (She has a LOT) It's a job she gets paid for because how labor intensive it is being that they are so many. My wife is the eldest. 
    I asked my wife if I could have shotgun with her mom. I open the passenger door to see papers in a yellow envelope. I know MIL is VERY picky about her papers. I see one on the floor, I pick it up and put it on top. I see cards shoved in the butt of the seat. Fearing they may get lost if they are important, I pull them out and observe to double check. They were business cards so I assumed nothing of it. But, they were cards for a very well known legal group. So I thought, 'oh, well of course these are very important, let me put them on top.' 
    We all knew of her on-going legal disputes between several businesses. That information was far from unknown to everyone. 
    So I stood waiting for MIL to come outside, retrieve the papers so I could sit, and for us to leave. I stood for a minute or two, just joking around with DW and one of the sisters. MIL finally came out, she walked to the car and sat down in the drivers seat. I say, 'HERE ARE YO LEGAL DOCUMENTS,' in my usual silly voice. Keep in mind, before I said anything, she was just fine. 
    MIL started going OFF! We thought she was playing around like she usually does at first. But we soon realized, that wasn't the case. She stated that I was reading her paystubs and going through her personal files. I told her the only piece I read was the business card and that I wanted to see if it was trash or just part of folder. She accused me of pointing all the papers at myself so I could read them. She said she seen me do it. I was standing straight up the whole time, talking to DW and SIL. So, even if I DID want to read her papers, there is no way that is possible with how visually impaired I am. I apologized for reading the business card and told her how I picked up the stray paper so it wouldn't blow away. She continued accusing me of this elaborate plot. We have never asked her for money, nor did I know the paystub was even in there. They is no motive let alone no way I could've done it.
   DW started aggressively defending me, also stating, I AM TOO BLIND TO READ THE PAPER WHILE STANDING UPRIGHT. MIL started talking to me like a child, 'how would you like it if I came into your house and read your paystubs?' I have spent my whole life arguing with people like her, so I didn't give it any energy. It was a quiet ride home, except for one more thing between DW and MIL.
   ""She didn't do it mom. You need to apologize""
   ""I'm sorry you feel like she didn't do it but, it's really not okay for her to be reading my paystubs""
    We went home and thought that she would cool down from her outburst soon enough. She didn't. She gossiped her own mother about it not but four days later. Thankfully, GMIL knows full and well that I am blind and could not have read them.   
    I am no longer going over there on my days off. I am avoiding drama by merely unfollowing her Facebook feed instead of unfriending and blocking. My wife still wants to work with her siblings. She is much more emotionally strong than I.
    Today, FIL, lazy piece of crap that just lays around and plays on his phone and kicks the poor dog, had the audacity to accuse DW of not taking care of her siblings. DW quickly resolved to just writing down a log of everything she does to combat these insane accusations. If things continue to worsen, we have agreed to withdraw from contact with MIL until things are put right. 
    I may have been wrong for reading the business card. I apologized. You may call me dramatic but, my own mother would steal and accuse me of doing it. I am deeply scarred by that. After coming home,I had flashbacks so bad I couldn't see anything in front of me for 45 minutes. I was wriathing in emotional agony. 
    Sorry again if I am redditing wrong. I just desperately needed to vent.",JUSTNOMIL
"My mom accused me of breaking my dad's heart because I told her if we cannot sort out our issues living together I would not maintain a relationship with her which meant I couldn't have a relationship with my father either  since he has said point blank that he will always take her side. This was my response. Did I do the right thing?

""My entire life you have always put your wants over the wants and needs of everyone else around you. From drug addiction and allowing me to be molested by xxxxx  (I told you when I was 11 and you told me I must be mistaken, probably because xxxxx's mom was your main source of drugs) when I was a child to adopting every stray teenager in -hometown- when your own teen daughter was struggling and now with your current behavior I really question why I ever gave you so many chances to be a mother to me when it is so obviously outside of your realm of abilities.  

It is interesting to me that for as far back as I can remember you've invited people down on their luck and trying to rebuild their lives I to your home even when they negatively impacted your own actual family members and never asked a thing from them in return. Teen boy got kicked out of his grandmas house for dealing drugs but he moved in and was given my bedroom for free despite his constantly bullying of me and his endangering of dad's freedom because if police had discovered he was dealing out of our home they would have arrested Daddy as well because a felon cant even be associated with that. Teen girl and other teen boy and their baby moved in and never contributed rent or groceries or housework but they were welcome and allowed to live how they pleased within their own private space. It seems like you are able to respect the autonomy of other people only so long as they are not related to you.

When we first began to search for a home together after your house was foreclosed on I wanted to be optimistic that you would be a better grandmother than you were a mom but the last 10 months have shown me that you lack something fundamental to having a family and that is the ability to care more for others than you do about yourself. I should have known from the first time you backed out because you refused to pay extra rent for my cat while you were fine paying extra rent for your dog. I see now that we should have just gone our separate ways then but you promised me that you only wanted to help us and that the baby would come first before anything else. 

You are constantly hassling us for money we don't have because you cannot keep yourself out of debt. You didn't like your old furniture so you went out and got rent to own furniture. You didn't like Grandmas truck so you went and got a new car payment to make. You have a land phone line that you never use and although SO and I have told you many times that just by using amazon Prime and Netflix and Hulu you could watch all the television you could possibly want without having to pay for a cable package you would rather the cable package. Dad and I discussed back at the end of March that I wouldn't be able to pay my share of rent for a while until I was established in a new job and as far as I knew that was still understood by all parties. I make 170 a paycheck which is just enough to have 30 dollars left at the end of the month after paying my car payment which I need in order to get to work and go on interviews. It is not my fault that you cannot manage your spending.

It is breaking my heart that you would rather cause friction between me and my partner and tear our family apart han admit that maybe just maybe you are the cause of this discord. We have never tried to control you, as much as we have expected you to stick to what you told us. You told us you wanted to help us and that we would all be equals but now you are trying to accuse us of taking over your space when we literally have the exact same amount of living, sleeping and shared space. You told us you were fine with SO managing the kitchen and that you would help maintain it and then had fits when old, broken and moldy dishes and appliances got discarded. You told us we would be able to have our own space but then you tried to force your old furniture on us and had a fit when we didn't want it.

The only thing SO and I are guilty of is being a struggling young couple who want to be able to live our lives bit happen to be related to you. I want to work things out and be able to have my father in my life, but I don't see how its possible. YOU are breaking dads heart by allowing your ego and lack of self control to be more important than his health and our daughters well being.""",JUSTNOMIL

I posted about RD a few days ago, she's ruining her daughter's wedding. RD is my MIL.



So this morning my in laws where baby sitting the grandkids from their eldest son. I came down around 11 because I had to leave for work around 12. I spoke with RD about the client I was meeting. A bitter old hag who I can't seem to cheer up. RD always fills in what she doesn't know, so she went on a rant about how she KNEW this client had difficulty with being old and shit. I said, can be, I don't know. Note, RD never met my client so she can never know, she can guess.  



So after a but of telling me how my client feels, she took it to herself. That she was old and had the same issues. I said, RD you're 66, above medium age, but not elderly. Well she thought I said she was elderly and fucking lost it. Infront of her 2 year old grandchild. Seriously guys... if I ever get kids, she's not watching them. Fuck she should be glad if I allow her to see them. FIL is bad in his own way, but by far not as unreasonable and toxic as RD.



I fled the house when she went off and went to the hairdresser after the client. For some reason RD thinks she does everything for everyone, while she always says she will help but then suddenly last minute I have to figure it out myself. 



I already told my BF that we will not marry until she has passed. In no way shape or form, does she get the chance to ruin my special days. She can try to ruin my relationship, as she has been doing all along. But she seems to forget I am smarter than her. And I will beat her in this game. I know the tricks, she doesn't know I do. And she doesn't know, this is war.

"&amp;#x200B;

MIL is due for a visit and I am DREADING IT! She's supposed to be coming in July but hasn't told us when. It's making me quite frustrated as I want to have time to mentally prepare myself and come up with a plan, as well as make other plans for the month. She wanted to come the week of our 3rd wedding anniversary this month and I said thats a HARD no.

&amp;#x200B;

Last time she was here, in March, she made me feel like I was unwelcome in my own home and that I was a worthless wife.

&amp;#x200B;

She went behind my back and told my husband when they were alone that she was worried I wasn't taking care of him and that he looked skinny (mind you, he's always been bigger and has been eating much more healthy than he did growing up, plus exercising daily. He's the fittest he has ever been and looks SO great.) Also, I had a cold and didn't want to spread germs so I let them cook- big fricken deal. Now that I think about it I should've spit in her food- lol I'm a terrible person. She comes in my house and basically takes over the cooking and planning, so next time I'm just going to go grocery shopping before she comes and plan everything out, she will LOVE that!!! Free groceries aren't worth her being in control.

&amp;#x200B;

She says whatever she can to make herself feel superior to me. It's like a battle of who does DH love more, and it's ridiculous. I don't even compete, but she does. She told him she thought I was bitter about a situation that she was not even involved in. I actually handled the extremely difficult situation with the UTMOST grace and maturity, so that was like a HUGE slap in the face. She also told him that it's good that I don't compare myself to others as much anymore (wtf- she asked me if I was still seeing my dermatologist for my acne scars and I said no, not right now- so this is where that comment came from). Like, um, ok, thanks for your input-----not. This is so funny to me because she's always flaunted her body and now that I'm more fit than her she refused to take her shirt off at the beach. Yet, I am the only one comparing myself to others.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of this visit in July, there's a possibility she might be going on our annual fishing trip (God forbid this, please NO) and coming for Thanksgiving. That's a tail I told in r/JustNoSO. But basically, BIL &amp; GF, MIL &amp; FIL might all be coming to our 2 bed 1 bath apartment for Thanksgiving. Don't forget our 2 70 LB dogs. No one asked me (thanks, DH). MIL is always on her WORST behavior when she has everyone together. Last time we were all together she put me on scale and told me my BMI was too high in front of everyone, just to humiliate me. It's only June and I already have anxiety about all this......!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm about to go back to school for my Master's degree and my MIL nosily asks my DH or I  about my progress when we talk or FaceTime then says things like ""oh, ok""  when we can hear FIL in the background saying ""good for her."" There is 0 support or encouragement on her end. I don't really care. I'm happy and I'm doing it. I'm going into the same field as her and getting the same degree, and she doesn't enjoy her job, plus I think she thinks I'm not cut out for it. I think SHE'S the one not cut out for it. Also, I think she's pissed that I'll have the same amount of education as her...jealous much?

&amp;#x200B;

Our current rules for her coming are that I'm not to be her chauffeur nor her babysitter nor her entertainer and that my DH has to take off work if I am home alone with her.

Last night I told DH during dinner that maybe if I'm lucky SO will come when I'm gone on my solo trip in July. He didn't respond and just kept eating and looking down. I laughed. He knows his mom's behavior needs to be addressed but he's conflicted as to how to handle her. Are there any other boundaries I should try to implement??

&amp;#x200B;

A HUGE concern is when we decide to have kids in the next few years that she's going to tell us what to do and be rude when we want to do things our own way. Just because my husband was a golden child doesn't mean I have to parent the same exact way. I want to nip all of that in the bud before I even get pregnant.

We want to have a sit down with her about her behavior but don't want to do it out of the blue. I think when she slips up again it's time for everything to just be laid out on the table.",JUSTNOMIL
"Okay, so for short recap of my stories here: Staples is my mother.  She is nicknamed for saying she would staple my knees together to keep me from getting pregnant.  She hates my FH, my abusive brother is her GC, and she has a fuck ton of FLEAs that she's kept for approximately 50 years now.

As title says, I've come yo a realization as to why I'm the scapegoat for Staples.  And quite frankly, it's because I take after Oma (maternal grandmother) more than anyone else in the family.

I have the same eye disease as Oma.  We've held high school graduation photos of Oma and I next to each other - we easily look like sisters.  Oma and I have similar builds and fashion tastes (or, at least what she used to look like and wear.  She's 80.)  And though I'm not Oma's GGC, she very clearly treats me better than she's ever treated Staples.

So essentially, Staples has me as her scapegot because it could possibly let her get back at her own mother for the abuses she lived through.  Which is about 100 different kinds of fucked up, and makes me glad that FH and I are solidifying plans to live together starting this fall.  Don't worry - I'm not informing Staples until a lease is signed.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hello! I'm new to /r/JUSTNOMIL, but have been lurking for the better part of 2 years now. 😊

I'm a foreigner living with my Husband near his home country. I gave up everything to be here with him, which I did willingly and happily. It hasn't been easy but after a couple of years together we're finally getting our footing. His family hasn't been supportive, which I don't mind except for the nosiness and nagging in lieu of their eldest navigating normal adult pitfalls.

Like most women, my biggest obstacle is my MIL. Two of the most aggravating and terrifying instances that come to mind include her colluding with the same bank as DH (we don't have proof unfortunately, just speculation and putting pieces of events together) to interfere with our loan to move a few hundred miles away for better work opportunities, and DH's parents pressuring him to share financial details. Of note: no, we did not live with them, nor were we financially reliant upon them. I've managed to pry DH away from his judgmental family to a certain degree but he's had a hard time letting go. I've by no means said he needs to cut them off permanently and am aware of his feelings on the matter... he wishes for the warmth and comfort of family... but am shell shocked by the lengths his Mother goes to keep treating DH like this. If this were any other person, including my own Mother, I would have pursued the situation legally to stop this harassment. I've told my Husband to down-shift their relationship and the amount of time he spends talking to his family or telling them anything of real importance about our life. This is a stark contrast to our first year and a half together where DH had a better relationship with them because I motivated him to spend more time together (even without me, in hindsight, a mistake), give advice to his younger brothers, and help his family out. 

So here's our timeline of my DH finally agreeing to address it:

August 2018: We move into our home, DH wants to focus on finding a job (which he did in 2 weeks), unpacking our things, getting to know the area, etc. He tells his Mother in light of what happened -- she showed up to our apartment 48 hours before we moved out, pounding on the door for 10 minutes straight and calling out my Husband's name, and then threatening (we assume) their bank to force a notarized signature for a loan (my Husband has $10K of debt including a car) to make them lower the amount we asked for (BY HALF!), he'd had enough of her meddling. She agreed to stop calling and prying. But she didn't. He made the mistake of sending texts every couple of weeks with pointed information; 'don't worry, have a job, things are good here' that was like feeding a snake mice guts and expecting it not to beg for the whole carcass. From the beginning, I explained grey rocking, setting boundaries and upholding consequences, etc. He was not interested in doing this, thinking he could have a functional relationship with his Mother and thereby the rest of his family after the shit she pulled. In January, behind my back and without my go ahead, although we'd had mock conversations, DH confronted his Mother about the bank thing. She completely denied it. I was furious because I hoped to collect information, contact his bank at a later date, and have this in our back pocket if we needed it or decided to pursue things legally. He showed his hand so she's probably gone back and covered her tracks. Absolute psycho tier shit, frankly. It took him another 4-5 months to accept and fully admit what she did. It's only as of April that he's put the story together and knows *she* tarnished their relationship, and the ones with his other family members in true Narc form. 

On top of it all, she's never stopped calling after being asked to on 5 separate occasions. The rest of the timeline looks like this: August - October, limited contact, no phone calls. October - January, DH unilaterally decides to 'normalize' the situation by pretending nothing happened, allowing her to call 3-5x per week and picking up once a week to answer basic questions. I think this is a massive mistake and tell him as much, explaining that he doesn't need his parents acceptance, permission or input. At this point he thought he was being kind by mostly ignoring her assuming she would get the hint, but nothing would stand in this troll's way. Someone's taking her baby away and encouraging him to be a better man than she did! Including DH no longer drinking, smoking, getting job training, a driver's license, losing 15 pounds and bulking up, eating healthily, all that GO YOU! stuff. You'd think a parent would be happy for their child, but not dear MIL of mine. *Nickname suggestions welcome.*

Anyway.

My Husband's work contract was up in March, and we knew a couple months in advance that this time was coming, so back to the rental sites I went. Unbeknownst to me, my DH confided all this in his family thinking that sharing personal information about our lives somehow wouldn't land us in more drama. We had a huge fight about it and he blocked his entire family member's phone numbers, which I told him was a stupid idea and that no-one better show up at our house again or I'd be pissed. ...His Father rocked up to our front door 3 days before moving, announcing his Wife (aka conniving MIL) is divorcing him. These two have been married for the better part of 30 years, they've had problems like financial scandals, cheating (FIL on MIL), tons of moving house, and other typical marriage ups and down. But you're telling me this bish looked at her calendar and thought ""Hmmm, yeah, around the time my son said they'd be moving is the perfect time to file""!? While we're getting our shit packed, stressing about finding movers, coordinating with new landlords, figuring out jobs in the area and so on, there's another family crisis? His Dad specifically asked DH to step in and convince MIL to stay with him. Like... just... my Husband is 30 years old. He doesn't need to be involved in y'alls divorce. Worth mentioning: DH explained they wouldn't get our home address after moving the first time because we didn't trust them not to show up. They demonstrated their respect for this wish by Googling our address and timing this all to the tune of Ursula's [Poor Unfortunate Souls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi58pN8W3hY). 

So this is a woman holding up her entire family to get her way and I'VE. HAD. IT. She's made other family members call my Husband after he blocked her number for a month, triangulated his brothers against him for guilt tripping purposes, timed her divorce to make a point and put the spotlight back on herself, she is r e l e n t l e s s! Considering she owns her own business and works 50 hours a week, I'm awed she has the energy to harass her son like he's a prisoner to his wife. I'm sure it makes for lively conversations in which DH's family members shit on me and blame me for my Husband pulling away. I'd be ecstatic to accept the scapegoat role if it meant they fucked off for some time.

DH has offered to change his number, but at this point I want the situation handled and that feels like a lateral move. He needs to face it head on legally (file a restraining order, harassment claim, whatever), come to some sort of agreement with his Mother (LOL i know this isn't really an option), or maybe consider cutting her off because she's batshit and hostile towards his wife and marriage? I think we've earned that. I'm worried because we now live in a country where if my Husband gets a phone number (basically inevitable), our address will be listed. I don't want the ~~hounds~~ family after us. The last time they spoke on the phone, MIL said 'I almost gave up on you' because my Husband didn't talk to her for 4 whole weeks. 🙄 She has some real balls to try and fuck her son out of better future prospects and then play the poor me card. I don't understand why this woman won't let DH live in peace and start his own life, checking in every once in a while like a well adjusted woman in her 50s should. Where are her friends? Why are none of his other family members holding her accountable or calling her out? Does nobody know how unhinged she is, or do they just want to avoid the line of fire? DH's made so much individual progress, I'm proud of him and simultaneously furious he won't choose a life with me over this insane woman that doesn't want him to be a functional, dedicated partner. How does he not see the obviousness of her poorly executed machinations and keep playing into her bs? Situations reversed, I'd cut my Mother out and throw a party knowing she'd never screw with me or my Husband again.

Advice most certainly welcome, I'm at the end of my rope. I drink like a glass of wine a year, and today's that day for me.

Signing off for now,

"Advice welcome, but not required. I've got things handled, so don't feel obligated to help me, but I'm always open to suggestions.   


Backstory: I meant to post some of these a while ago, but went and broke the one post per day rules (sorry, Mods, I truly am) and never got back to finish the story. But, the short version is this: Christmas was a meltdown that ended up in us getting kicked out of SiL's place in an effort to get the JNMIL out of there. Christmas was \*obviously\* not their faults. There was some back and forth, then a 2-hour one way phone conversation between JNMIL and DH. She ranted and ranted and ranted, and I transcribed the whole darn thing. There's a record of what she said. Then we went LC.   


One of the nastier things that JNMIL said during that conversation was a dig at my beloved, late grandmother. She said that my grandma pulled JNMIL aside at my wedding and asked how I had been treating JNMIL. According to JNMIL, Grandma said that she was worried about me, because I'm the most like my own JNM out of my siblings. This has literally shaken the core of my love for and relationship with my grandma, but she's dead, and I can't double check with her that JNMIL is (hopefully?) lying.  I decided I would not speak to JNMIL again until she apologized. She did the whole, ""We don't know what we said that was hurtful, can you tell us what we said that was so bad?"" So DH (well, I was the one texting) told her that it was all of it. She then remembered, word for word what was said, but didn't see anything wrong with it. I was done.  


End of January, my husband and I both promoted (military). They had been invited to the ceremony before the Christmas blowup, and then were asked not to come. We recieved a ""hope you have a good life"" text. Things have been quiet since. Last week, she texted DH asking to see my kid, and DH asked me. I said hard-no until JNMIL apologizes. She told DH that ""I'm not perfect"" and all that. DH thinks that kiddo deserves to have a grandma and deserves to have that relationship. This is about to affect my marriage, but that's a different story for a different sub.   


And then she decided to text me. God bless her.   


JNMIL:
Don't know if you saw the hangout appology I sent, but if you didn't, I am so sorry for hurting you by saying that about your grandmother. I also had a wonderful grandmother, and it was in the heat of the moment and not meant to hurt you. I am sorry.

ME:
My grandma and I were close, very close. She despised my mother but maintained a relationship just so JNM wouldn't cut her off from the grandkids. For my grandma to compare me to my mother would have been the biggest insult she could have ever given me, and I can't believe what you said was true. But, it gives me doubts in my grandma's true feelings towards me and my family, makes me question every time she said she's proud of me and for NOT following in my mother's footsteps. She was such a sweet lady to everyone - even to my mother. If the conversation you had with her really happened, then maybe she was lying to me my whole adult life. What you said shatters every ounce of belief that she had in me. She's dead, I can't ask her if she actually said those things or not. She doesn't have the chance to tell me you're wrong. Instead, your words have clouded my treasured memories and shaken my foundation in the most amazing woman I've ever known. I read everything. I've read the texts to DH when you couldn't remember what you said about Grandma, and then word-for-word relayed it but couldn't see anything wrong with it. This has gone entirely too far. I've put up with a lot of other things said ""in the heat of the moment"" and a lot of other drama in the 6 years DH and I have been married, but this one crossed a line that can't be taken back. Thank you for apologizing, I do appreciate it. It doesn't change how I feel nor does it undo the damage that was done. Never, ever, EVER dishonor the memory of my grandmother again. Ever.

ME:I heard the entire phone conversation that you had with DH when those things were said. If even half of what you said represented your true feelings and outlook, I think it best that we all keep our distance. You said, ""We're pretty happy with our lives, the only problem we have is with family"" and ""We feel so uncomfortable at your house. We can't wait to get out of there"" amongst other things. You're not an influence that we want in our home, and DH and I cause you too much pain. It's best for everyone to just let it be and live our own lives.

JNMIL:
I would just like to be a grandma to Kiddo. My grandmother and your grandmother were important to us. I know I can be a great grandma to her. She enjoyed being with us when you were deployed. We don't have to come to your home. DH said you were waiting for an apology. Would you consider letting us see our granddaughter?

ME
I've considered it, and I'm honestly not comfortable with it. You said that we (DH and myself, not sure if BiL and SiL were included in that) were the only negative things in your life and that you have a ""pretty darn good life otherwise."" You also talked about how much of a burden it was to help while I was deployed, so you are no longer on our family care plan - we fixed that for you. It is out of respect for you and your stated wishes during that phone call that we will maintain our space. Whether DH over-rules me or not is up to him. I hope this doesn't become another strain on our marriage. I'm done with the drama. It's been 6 years of this crap. There's no more yo-yo, no more back and forth, no blow-ups and apologies. It's not good for anyone involved and I'm not interested in participating any longer. You said ya'll are happier without us, and I will respect that.


JNMIL:
Please just stop taking things out of the heat of the moment so seriously. If we could talk like two adults, I just meant we have more drama with you guys than with any other areas of our life. That didn't mean I want to eliminate your DH and my granddaughter from my life. It just meant we need to fix things. Running away is not a fix. If DH has any love for us in his heart, this will wear on him as life goes on and it doesn't have to be like this. I know we don't get along, so what's wrong with just seeing DH and Kiddo when you are busy? If DH truly hates us, then he should be the one to tell us.


ME:
I take everything you say seriously, just as I would expect my words to be taken seriously. If you don't want me to take your words seriously, then don't say them. Restraint in the ""heat of the moment"" is a sign of maturity. We are talking like two adults - I've offered you the respect of adhearing to your requests you made during the phone conversation. The drama is not mine, it's yours. If you remember, you told us 2 days after our wedding that you never wanted to see us again but then suddenly wanted to see us the next day. It's that sort of back-and-forth that will not be tolerated any more. I'm not running from anything. I'm setting boundaries and eliminating strife and toxicity from my immediate family. It's been 6 years of this back-and-forth, and I'm done with it. I won't speak for DH, but I know that the strife gets to him, too. You've asked him to go between his wife and his mother, and that's not a good position for any man to be in. He doesn't hate you, he's just over the drama. What's wrong with seeing just them? We're a family unit. That's it. How would you feel if we invited just you over and not JNFIL? How would you feel if I told you that I didn't feel comfortable having a relationship with JNFIL, but wanted to see you all the time? That would be very disrrespectful to your family, and would be innapropriate for me to say. DH, Kiddo and I are a family unit. Respect us as a whole. It's been entirely too long since I've set some boundaries, and I apologize. Letting DH be the go-between has caused additional drama and strife, increasing the emotions and tensions. It was disrespectful of me to be unclear, and I am sorry for that. From now on out, I will be more firm and more clear instead of ignoring the issues.

I'm done. For real this time.",JUSTNOMIL
"Ugh, 9 weeks pregnant and frustrated. Living with in-laws for a few months to save money (read previous post in my history) and had my first baby appointment today. The little blob had arms and legs and was dancing around pretty adorable. Got ultrasound pics, love them. My husband was there and we're so excited to be parents.

Go to show pics to my MIL and she says ""Ohhh my grandbaby! She's so cute she's my little angel grandbaby.""

I realized today she hasn't once referred to the baby as mine, or as our baby (my husband and I's). She has exclusively called it her grandbaby, and keeps calling it ""her"". 

I replied, ""Yep, MY BABY.""

Oh and bonus terrible coincidence, my due date is my MILs birthday. We've already decided to just say ""New Years"" or a day not her birthday as not to give her anything else to claim as hers when it comes to our kid.

Nauseous, starving, and going a little crazy, I head for the fridge.. thanks for listening to me vent.",JUSTNOMIL
"So I had somewhat of an update when we made our move six weeks ago but everything’s been pretty hectic so I haven’t had a chance but I don’t think now is the time for that. Something else has happened and I want to give her a good smack to her fucking face. 

So FH and I are travelling and as such, we’re living in our car. Yesterday afternoon we were involved in a four car pile up and our car is absolutely totalled and unsalvageable. Because we were rear ended by an uninsured driver, it’s unlikely we’ll be able to recoup our enormous losses. We have no money for a new car and no place to stay. We got paid from our last job on Friday and spent most of our money replacing some shoddy stuff that came with the car. 

Long story short, we literally could have died. Our car was crushed like a tin can and we both have pretty moderate whiplash. Everything we had in the back was destroyed and all of our things were just strewn across two lanes as the back window blew out. We’ve managed to get a room for three nights while we assess our options as we don’t have a lot of money so for the time being, in that regard, we’re ok. To top it off, FH had a severe bug bite that had to be  drained yesterday morning which is now infected, so we’re not doing too great. 

FH called WitchBitch a few hours after it happened while we were still on the side of the road waiting for a tow. I’d been the one driving so I was still shaking trying to make sense of it all. FH showed her our destroyed car on FaceTime and all she had to say was a very flat “well I’m glad everyone’s alright. I’ve got to go I’ll speak to you later.” And that was it. He hasn’t heard from her since. She hasn’t texted him once to see how he’s doing, how he’s feeling, what’s going on, nothing. 

He called her tonight and I am LIVID. In a ten minute phone call, all she did was berate him for buying the car in the first place, for not having the most expensive insurance, for sleeping in the car in the first place (it had a bed in the back, we weren’t like homeless), for not taking anti histamines every day (???), for not informing her that we’d gotten insurance and which insurance we’d gotten when we took out the policy over a month ago, for not working hard enough before we left, for not saving more before we left, and because his sister (her step daughter) has offered us some money if we need it. That’s right - she’s berating *him* because his sister, of her own volition, offered FH money that he hasn’t even accepted. 


And not once during all of that has she asked him how he is. Nothing. 


He even began to say to her that we need to go to the hospital tomorrow morning for his infection and because we both have pretty bad whiplash and all she replied was “well, I’ve got to go I’ll speak to you later.” That was it. 


Somewhere in there too, she said for him to wait to hear from her because she has a lot to think about. A LOT TO THINK ABOUT. She’s literally punishing him for being the passenger in a no fault pile up. What the FUCK does she have to be angry about??? That we bought a car without her permission??? That we didn’t ask her permission or advice about anything??? What the fuck is fucking wrong with you?? Your son could have fucking died and you’re angry at him over nothing. You heartless, selfish, self centred, cold hearted cunt. 


In the meantime, my moms been on the phone to me multiple times a day, checking in on both of us, sending us some money so we can get a coffee or breakfast or dinner since it’s really not in our budget right now, she’s been researching online about our rights as foreigners injured abroad, combing through our travel and car insurance policies, going completely above and beyond. In the last twelve hours alone I’ve had texts from my mom, brother, sister in law, two aunts and a cousin just making sure we’re ok... yet this horrible bitch can’t get her head out of her own ass for thirty seconds to check whether her son is ok. Spoiler alert: he’s really not. 

You’re going to fucking hell and I will never, EVER forgive you for this.",JUSTNOMIL
"I'm usually a lurker but I feel so uneasy that I've decided to make an account and post. My DH and I moved to his country to live with my MIL and SFIL a year and a half ago because we had an unexpected pregnancy and needed support while we got on our feet. It was supposed to be temporary until we got our own apartment. But my DH sunk into a deep depression and can't work. A lot of it is caused by living with his family, so we have decided to move back to my country a few months from now. One, because we get along with my family a lot better and two, because we have a nice job lined up. This obviously isn't going over well.  


My MIL has had her moments of JUSTNO before this. For example, she told a lot of her friends a deeply personal medical procedure I was having. I know this because I've had multiple strangers inquire about it at parties. I also know she badmouths us in general because these same people will make sly digs and my DH and me if we happen to be around them. They've even outright talked crap about my husband at my birthday party, when I was sitting right there. The list goes on and on. She clearly has some choice words to say to us but prefers to play the victim and let us find out through other people. We haven't been to an outing with her friends around in months and prefer not to be invited.   


My DH just ignores it all and keeps to himself as much as possible. The one time we decided to confront her in a respectful way ended in her having a fit and telling us to find somewhere else to live, to which my DH replied, ""Evict us then."" That was about three months ago. He's admitted to me that he loves his parents but he doesn't like them at all. Which makes us moving away a lot easier for him. I certainly am not losing sleep over this decision. We told them three days ago and had my DH's father break the news to her. (He offered and said it was best if it came from him.) At first she was accepting and kept saying how she would be supportive of us and how she wanted to spend our last months together as a family, but it only took a day for her to start texting him links to apartments and offering to pay our deposit.   
My DH has told her again that our decision is final and that we just wanted this to be drama free. She said she understood and was just being selfish but left folders titled ""Apartments."" ""Driving courses."" and ""Jobs"" for us to see today on the kitchen counter top.   


The thing is we could have really used their help months ago but only now after we decided to leave do they start trying to help us? It just seems so manipulative. My SFIL is a huge narc and we are sure he's feeding into her delusional hope that she can convince us to stay here even after we've made it very clear that we are going. This is just the first week and I am worried that this will escalate as we get closer to the moving date. I am not sure at all how to handle this. I wouldn't put it past them at all to try more aggressive ways to keep us here and I am honestly on edge. I know my DH has got my back but it doesn't stop them from making us really uncomfortable. I haven't even posted the news on my Facebook in fear that they will get their friends to spoil it somehow and twist it into a personal attack on them.   


TL;DR: Boundary stomping MIL and SFIL make our lives toxic and is surprised we decided to move far away. Have decided to bribe and guilt us to stay and make our lives extremely uncomfortable.",JUSTNOMIL
"First time posting here. Sorry this is long or if formatting is weird, I'm on mobile. 

MIL has a bad habit of favoring other grandchildren over my son and it's getting worse. 
Since my son has been born MIL has always done more and more time with her other grandkids in general over my son. For example, for Christmas she got my son one dollar store toy to ""open"". My son was 3 months old at the time so he didn't really know what was going on of course but it was kind of awkward to sit there and watch all the other grandchildren and their parents open gifts while I just sat there. It was his first Christmas, so I thought she'd want to do more with him but I brushed off thinking maybe she thought DS was too little to know anyway. I continued to let go of incidences like this but recently I've reached my breaking point.

A couple days ago DH and I went to visit MIL (15 minutes away) because it had been almost 2 weeks since she has seen our son. She will not come to visit with us, we always come to her on her terms. We got there at about 11AM. I spread out a blanket with some toys to entertain DS, DH went outside with FIL. For the first 5 or 6 hours we were there MIL acted like we didn't exist. She went about cleaning up (the house wasn't dirty), walking around, basically like she was trying to find something to do. Keep in mind, she will call DH and complain about how she never see DS. Well, unbeknownst to me BIL and SIL come over. They have a 5 month old son. When they came in the door she immediately grabbed him up and kissed and hugged and loved all over him, and continued to play with him the rest of our visit, still ignoring my son until about 9PM. DH told MIL  it was late and past DS's bedtime and he was getting very whiney at point. MIL says ""Well can I see him before you leave???"" So DH husband hands DS to her and DS whines and figits a little bit. MIL say ""Ugh here, take him back he doesn't love me"" looks at BIL's son and says ""But *baby's name"" does, yes he does!"" Picks him up and goes back to playing with him. DH says ""Mom, why would you say that?"" She rolls her eyes and ignores him. Maybe I should have addressed it right then, but it was late, I was tired, DS was tired, I wanted to go home. I go to walk out and say ""It was good to see y'all"" MIL mocks me ""It was good to see y'all"". We haven't spoken since. I'm not sure how to move forward. 

I've been with DH for 8 years and MIL has been cruel to me in past but it never really bothered me until I had DS. I will not tolerate that kind of behavior around or directed at my son. I grew up with my grandparents playing favorites and pitting me and other children against each other and I have a whole host of insecurities/issues because of it and I will not expose my son to that toxic bullshit I know that for sure. What I don't know is how to approach this or even what to say. I want to be peaceful, I don't want to start some kind of big argument but I know I can't stay silent any longer because things will only get worse but I'm at a loss. Please, any advice will help.",JUSTNOMIL
"I'm a foreigner living with my Husband near his home country. I gave up everything to be here with him, which I did willingly and happily. It hasn't been easy but after a couple of years together we're finally getting our footing. His family hasn't been supportive, which I don't mind except for the nosiness and nagging in lieu of their eldest navigating normal adult pitfalls.

Like most women, my biggest obstacle is my MIL. Two of the most aggravating and terrifying instances that come to mind include her colluding with the same bank as DH (we don't have proof unfortunately, just speculation and putting pieces of events together) to interfere with our loan to move a few hundred miles away for more opportunities, and DH's parents pressuring him to share financial details. Of note: no, we did not live with them, nor were we financially reliant upon them. I've managed to pry DH away from his judgmental family to a certain degree but he's had a hard time letting go. I've by no means said he needs to cut them off permanently and am aware of his feelings on the matter... he wishes for the warmth and comfort of family... but am shell shocked by the lengths his Mother goes to keep treating DH like this. If this were any other person, including my own Mother, I would have pursued the situation legally to stop this harassment. I've told my Husband to down-shift their relationship and the amount of time he spends talking to his family or telling them anything of real importance about our life. This is a stark contrast to our first year and a half together where DH had a better relationship with them because I motivated him to spend more time together (even without me), give advice to his younger brothers, and help his family out. 

So here's our timeline of my DH finally agreeing to address it:

August 2018: We move into our home, DH wants to focus on finding a job, which he did in 2 weeks, unpacking our things, getting to know the area, etc. He tells his Mother in light of what happened -- she showed up to our apartment 48 hours before we moved out, pounding on the door for 10 minutes straight and calling out my Husband's name, and then threatening (we assume) their bank to force a notarized signature for a loan (my Husband has $10K of debt including a car, and decent job/credit standing) to make them lower the amount we asked for (BY HALF!), he'd had enough of her meddling. She agreed to stop calling and prying. But she didn't. He made the mistake of sending texts every couple of weeks with pointed information; 'don't worry, have a job, things are good here' that was like feeding a snake mice guts and expecting it not to beg for the whole carcass. From the beginning, I explained grey rocking, setting boundaries and upholding consequences, etc. He was not interested in doing this, thinking he could have a functional relationship with his Mother and thereby the rest of his family after the shit she pulled. In January, behind my back and without my go ahead, although we'd had mock conversations, DH confronted his Mother about the bank thing. She completely denied it. I was furious because I hoped to collect information, contact his bank at a later date, and have this in our back pocket if we needed it or decided to pursue things legally. He showed his hand so she's probably gone back and covered her tracks. Absolute psycho tier shit, frankly. It took him another 4-5 months to accept and fully admit what she did. It's only as of April that he's put the story together and knows *she* tarnished their relationship, and the ones with his other family members in true Narc form. 

On top of it all, she's never stopped calling after being asked to on 5 separate occasions. The rest of the timeline looks like this: August - October, limited contact, no phone calls. October - January, DH unilaterally decides to 'normalize' the situation by pretending nothing happened, allowing her to call 3-5x per week and picking up once a week to answer basic questions. I think this is a massive mistake and tell him as much, explaining that he doesn't need his parents acceptance, permission or input. At this point he thought he was being kind by mostly ignoring her, assuming she would get the hint but nothing stood in this troll's way. Someone's taking her baby away and encouraging him to be a better man than she did! Including DH no longer drinking, smoking, getting job training, a driver's license, losing 15 pounds and bulking up, eating healthily, all that GO YOU! stuff. You'd think a parent would be happy for their child, but not dear MIL of mine. *Nickname suggestions welcome.*

Anyway.

My Husband's work contract was up in March, and we knew a couple months in advance that this time was coming, so back to the rental board I went. Unbeknownst to me, my DH confided all this in his family thinking that sharing personal information about our lives somehow wouldn't land us in more drama. We had a huge fight about it and he blocked his entire family member's phone numbers, which I told him was a stupid idea and that no-one better show up at our house again or I'd be pissed. His Father rocked up to our front door 3 days before moving, announcing his Wife (aka conniving MIL) is divorcing him. These two have been married for the better part of 30 years, they've had problems including financial scandals, cheating (FIL on MIL), tons of moving house, and other typical marriage ups and down. But you're telling me this bish looked at her calendar and thought ""Hmmmm, yeah, around the time my son said they'd be moving is the perfect time to file""!? While we're getting our shit packed, stressing about finding movers, coordinating with new landlords, figuring out jobs in the area and so on, there's another family crisis? His Dad specifically asked DH to step in and convince MIL to stay with him. Like... just... my Husband is 30 years old. He doesn't need to be involved in y'alls divorce. Worth mentioning: DH explained they wouldn't get our home address because we couldn't trust them not to show up. They demonstrated their respect for this wish by Googling our address and timing this all to the tune of Ursula's [Poor Unfortunate Souls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi58pN8W3hY). 

So this is a woman holding up her entire family to get her way and I'VE. HAD. IT. She's made other family members call my Husband after he blocked her number, triangulated his brothers against him for guilt tripping purposes, timed her divorce to make a point and put the spotlight back on herself, she is r e l e n t l e s s! Considering she owns her own business and works 50 hours a week, I'm awed she has the energy to harass her son like he's a prisoner to his wife. I'm sure it makes for lively conversations in which DH's family members shit on me and blame me for my Husband pulling away. I'd be ecstatic to accept the scapegoat role if it meant they fucked off for some time.

DH has offered to change his number, but at this point I want the situation handled and that feels like a lateral move. He needs to face it head on legally (file a restraining order, harassment claim, whatever), coming to some sort of agreement with his Mother (LOL i know this isn't really an option), or maybe consider cutting her off because she's batshit and hostile towards his wife and marriage? I think we've earned that. I'm worried because we now live in a country where if my Husband gets a phone number (basically inevitable), our address will be listed. I don't want the ~~hounds~~ family after us. The last time they spoke on the phone, MIL said 'I almost gave up on you' because my Husband didn't talk to her for 4 whole weeks. 🙄 She has some real balls to try and fuck her son out of better future prospects and then play the poor me card. I don't understand why this woman won't let DH live in peace and start his own life, checking in every once in a while like a well adjusted woman in her 50s should. Where are her friends? Why are none of his other family members holding her accountable or calling her out? Does nobody know how unhinged she is, or do they just want to avoid the line of fire? DH's made so much individual progress, I'm proud of him and simultaneously furious he won't choose a life with me over this insane woman that doesn't want him to be happy. How does he not see the obviousness of her poorly executed machinations? Situations reversed, I'd cut my Mother out and throw a party knowing she'd never fuck with me or my Husband again.

Advice most certainly welcome, I'm at the end of my rope. I drink like a glass of wine a year, and tonight's that night for me.

Signing off for now,

"I've seen a lot of people posting on here about their MIL and weddings so I thought I would share mine!

DH and I had been dating for 4 years before we got engaged, but my MIL had always treated me like some fly-by-night girl he had brought home. She was shocked when we got engaged. Her campaign of passive-aggressiveness began in earnest.
 
DH and I both have social anxiety so we decided we wanted a small wedding (&lt;60 people). Since it was going to be small my parents offered to pay for it. MIL was NOT ok with this. She thought we should have a wedding EXACTLY  like hers: we should go to the courthouse with one witness (her) and then go to Red Lobster afterward! I politely told her that wasn't the wedding we wanted, but that didn't stop her from recounting her wedding story every time the wedding was brought up over the next year and a half, and criticizing my parents for ""wasting money"".  About a year before the wedding MIL begrudgingly offered to plan and pay for the rehearsal dinner after she finally realized we weren't going with her suggestion. This is important later.

DH went to his mom about the guest list a year before the wedding. Since we were keeping it small, he wanted her advice on who to invite. She told him then to let her think about it for a bit. 6 months before the wedding he asks her again. Her response is "" invite whoever you want, it's your wedding. Every one will just deal"". 3 months before the wedding he presents her with his final guest list, which is short because he only had one side if the family to invite and only invited the family members that he actually talked to regularly. She refused to even look at the list and repeated her invite whoever speech. 

3 weeks before the wedding it apparently became real for her. My husband called her up asking if she had picked a place for the rehearsal dinner. She started screaming at him that not enough of her family members were in the wedding party so she would no longer be going to the rehearsal dinner. She also would NOT be planning it, but my FIL still insisted on paying for it. Cue the first  awkward conversation with my parents, adding planning the rehearsal dinner to the long list of things to be done. 

2 weeks before the wedding MIL calls up my husband screaming at him over the guest list she refused to have anything to do with. She was mad because he didn't invite his Godparents.  He told her he didn't even KNOW who his Godparents were, and THAT'S why he wanted her to go over the guest list with him, but SHE refused to do so. Her response was to hang up on him.

The next day his sister got in on the action and picked a fight with him. She then went to MIL sobbing and turned the fight around on my husband. So my MIL called DH and told him he wasn't her son anymore, and she was no longer going to the wedding nor would they pay for the rehearsal dinner. Cue awkward conversation #2 with my parents, now burdening them with more financial responsibility. 

3 days before the wedding my FIL called to say he had calmed MIL down enough so that she was going to the wedding again. He also said they would pay for the rehearsal dinner like they originally planned. Cue awkward conversation #3 with my parents, who responded with ""we're just gonna plan on paying for it"".

Rehearsal day! My MIL only talked to DH's cousin (best man) and my MOH. When my family tried to be nice to her she literally turned her back on them and refused to even exchange pleasantries. 

Then came the rehearsal dinner...(thankfully this was all kept from me until weeks later)

The check comes. Both fathers go after it. There is a passive-aggressive exchange between the two that ends with my dad letting FIL pay. This sets off my MIL who decides to go tell off my mother. MIL accuses my mom of ""hijacking HER rehearsal dinner"", and ""throwing money around"". My mother snapped and told her ""I didn't hijack ANYTHING! YOU said you weren't going to plan it so we had to! And we aren't ""throwing money around"" because again, YOU said you weren't paying for it either, meaning WE would have to! Up until 3 days ago you weren't even coming to YOUR OWN SON'S WEDDING! How were we to know if you were even coming or not? This is not on us! This is all on you!""

On the wedding day she was pretty tame. Refused to talk to me or my family, and once the story about her telling mom off made the rounds it cemented her as a first class B to the rest of my family. 

After this debacle (added to all the others) my husband finally decided to go NC, which then extended to the family because they would either try and facilitate meeting between the two (""but you only get one mother! Family is more important than ANYTHING!""), or they would feed her info which he didn't want happening. We eventually moved 1000mi away because we lived in one of their apartments and they (understandably)kicked us out. With her history we knew if we stayed local it was only a matter of time before she showed up on our doorstep. 

Some good things came out if this though, my parents now treat my husband like he is their son, and our relationship is stronger than ever now that we don't have her stress piled onto it. If she hadn't been so crazy around our wedding I'm not sure that my husband would have gone NC when he did. So there is that.",JUSTNOMIL
"So I recently found out I'm a 34H bra. Like 2 days ago recent. I've never been heavy and am currently at my heaviest at 170lbs. Luckily for me a lot of it is muscle and I still fit in the pants I wore in high school and s/m shirts depending. So I'm heavy but don't look big.  Looks are important in out family as my mother likes to remind everyone she was a Calvin Klein, Eddie Bauer model. Growing up my mother was obsessed with being the smallest and most attractive in the family. For some reason her hair didn't grow past her shoulders and once mine did naturally she went and paid for a weave so her hair could be the longest kind of obsessed. She and my step dad would say that my mom was clearly skinnier than I was even though I was a size 6 and her a 18. I mean full blown competition. She would buy me larger clothing for me than she would for her and constantly wear booty shorts and crop tops. Tell me I was fat, hair was bad, legs too stubby etc. Now she's not super big (she's at 210lbs atm) but we are not compatible sizes but for some reason we hold weight really well (people usually guess my weight around 110lbs). Anyways the BIGGEST thing for both of them was my breast size. In middle school I used to sneak my mother's 36DD bras (she wore when she was pregnant)  just so I could have something I could breath in. Once they found out my step dad told me that 'my tits we're not as big as your mother's.' and 'they aren't even comparable and you shouldn't be wearing any sizes bigger than her'. This was my entire puberty and while I was bigger chested than most girls I still couldn't live up to my mother (who was measured at a 44DD but insisted that she was actually a 36C) and I wasn't allowed to go past a C cup without ww3 happening. And by that I mean getting screamed at that my breasts weren't that big and that my mom was simultaneously smaller, prettier and bigger chested. Well I lived under them financially until I was 23. (long story but basically they took my entire income so I couldn't save to move out) well I got out a year ago and went NC. I measured for a bra the other day since mine literally snapped (a Victoria Secret 34D not designed to unlock in the front snapped from pressure while I was at work) and surprise surprise I was wearing the wrong size. I was wearing a 34D when I should have been a 34H. Oh and my mother and I look like identical twins facially. I'm just shorter and naturally have a smaller frame than her. I'm 5'4 she's 5'10. Maybe that's why she always feels the need to compete. Did anyone else experience this? Especially the obsession with bra sizes? How did you deal with this?",JUSTNOMIL
"My MIL does exactly what title says. Her family owns rental property, that my husband will one day inherit, that we are currently renting at a slight discount (since my husband partially owns but the property does have a mortgage). My husband and I have been there for less than six months while we are saving money and searching for a home to purchase. The plan was to be there less than a year. We requested a six month lease with option to renew, and she said we didn’t need a lease since we are family and she trusts us. I know I’m dumb.

Some background, my MIL has severe narcissistic tendencies. She is on her third marriage, my FIL was her second divorce. She has 8 children, 3 of which rent nearby. My husband and I are the most stable of those who rent from her, but nothing we do is good enough for her. She hates the way our house is decorated, she hates that we choose for my husband to be the stay at home dad, she hates our dogs (and regularly “forgets” to shut the door when she leaves, so they get out). She lets herself in with her key all the time, and she has my husbands siblings meet her at our house for all of the rent collecting and general bitch fests. Our house is the central hub for custody exchanges, and she hates my FIL so much that she will drop the kids off and leave before he arrives. Two of my husbands siblings are not totally self-sufficient (they live together and have special needs diagnoses) and she refuses to help them in any way, despite being their payee, and leaves us to fill in the gaps. We do it because we want them to have the help that they cannot get any other way. My FIL helps where he can but works two full time jobs whereas she is retired. It has become a battle of the wills where my husband and I, and their other children, are the ones who suffer. 

She moved in with her most recent love interest two months into dating, and he’s generally terrible. They don’t get along, and she wants to leave him. Our house is her backup house, which in hindsight is why no lease. She came over today for god knows what, and let herself in. I was running exceptionally late for work and just did not have the fucking time for any of her shit. I told her where my husband was, that I was late for work, and would see her another time. 

When I got to work, I had a text message that said she’d talked to my husband, she had never been anything but nice to us, and she was tired of being treated like shit, and we needed to find somewhere else to live. There was a second message that said I didn’t speak to her and if I didn’t like her at my house, I don’t like her at all (wtf does that even mean?). I responded back, saying we get approximately 20 knocks on the door a day and I sometimes can’t deal with it, I was running late for work, and I was sorry she took it that way.

I called my husband immediately, who said she collected our rent and left for his brothers house-there was no conversation. He said she was probably picking a fight because she wants the house back and was hoping she could save face if we were portrayed as in the wrong. 

I am OVER IT, y’all. She feels like she gets a say in our life, and there are many more horrible examples of this. She disrespects our choices and belittles my husband. She makes the power dynamic between us VERY known. Because she wasn’t the center of my universe for that two minute interaction, she wants to evict us. My husband is supportive and on my side, and we are firm that we will not see her, barring holidays, once we are out from under her thumb. Financially, we are strapped until we save enough money for our down payment (we are already preapproved). Most days I can be the one to say, “it’s just a little more time, we are almost there.” But after walking into an 8am meeting in tears, I just can’t today. She sent that message to me instead of my husband solely to be hurtful, since he’s been desensitized after 27 years of horse shit.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hello again, I’m still on mobile. please forgive me, I couldn’t figure out the right flair for the eating disorder trigger warning, it’s a very slight mention but an important example for the story. Also this is long, you have been warned.

Through out my life, my mother (EV) and my Narc Sister have been very consistent about letting me know how much they disapprove of my housekeeping. They also tended to comment on things that I did different from them, such as my health, or finances or anything along those lines.

Notice I said comment. They made passive-aggressive backhanded compliments like “wow turquoise pizza, you look great for just giving birth, definitely not as skinny as you were before, but still great!”  Gee thanks, Nsister. 

Now I am just built small/average sized, I think it’s just genetics but I also try to eat well and drink lots of water, so it’s just how it is. 

Nsister and EV make more comments then necessary and ones that make very uncomfortable. EV once asked me if I ever throw up my food after eating, I said NO, she “oh well, I used to, I just thought that’s how you stayed skinny” (I am completely average size, no where near unhealthy looking) she continues on telling me how she used to be sooo thin when she was my age and I’ll probably get fat eventually. And what’s the point of saying that?!

My point is that I felt like they made it into this weird competition, but I wasn’t trying to compete and I think cleaning is where they felt they were really “winning”. 

So they are both very pin-straight everything must be perfect households, EV is diagnosed with OCD, I am unsure if Nsister is also but they are on the same level of clean. I would say I am fairly average for a person with kids and dogs lol nothing will ever be completely clean and I’m ok with that, I don’t often make my bed, there’s usually toys lying around and I could probably tidy up in general more lol but it’s sanitary, I sweep, vacuum and do dishes and laundry every single day. 

My husband gets annoyed sometimes because he is also more of a type A cleaner and I am far more lax. I tend to let the house get messy, then power clean instead of cleaning through out the day. Sometimes we bicker about this. 

Sorry for all the backstory but I think it was necessary to understand the real story.

So my husband and I had just got married, we already had 2 kids and we were just trying to figure out our flow. At this point, we both worked full time and had divided up the chores as I do everything inside and he did everything outside (we owned a large property so there was lots to do). My Nsister came over for a visit and starts nagging me how I need to clean this and that, I brush her off and head out to work, husband is still home and they were doing something (I honestly cannot remember the purpose for her visit, this was 4 or so years ago). 

So I get a call on the way home from work, it’s Nsister. 

NS: hey how was work??

*she says this in a chipper tone and it puts me on guard because she almost never asks questions like this*

Me: .... it was good 

NS: that’s good, ok I need you to do me a *big* big sister favour 

I’m thinking she wants me to watch her kid or drive mom some where so I’m already like ok no problem 

Me: oh sure! What’s up?

NS: I need you to do a bit more cleaning 

Me: what?

NS: like your house, I think you should just work on cleaning your house a bit better.

Me: uhhh Why?

NS: look I’m just worried ok your husband is really, really wonderful and you’re lucky to have him and I think he might leave you if you don’t pick it up on the cleaning, don’t be upset, I’m just *warning* you, he was super upset after you left today

!!!!!!!! *!!!!!!!!* 

Me: 

NS: you’re not mad right?

Me: no I’m not mad. Got to go. Bye.(Deadtone, I want to talk to my husband before this shit starts)

So I get home and talk to my husband and he says she started bitching about my cleaning to him, and him being like ok slightly annoyed because I hadn’t been the greatest with it, let her and basically said something along the lines of “ya I’m not the biggest fan of how the house is kept right now but we are working on it together” and you know what, I’m absolutely fine with him bitching about me once in a while, it’s gonna happen, we are going to piss each other off, I bitch about stuff he does once in a while too, I’m not perfect and don’t pretend to be. But he was slightly annoyed not “super upset”.

It was my meddling sister I was annoyed with. So I didn’t call her back. I just let it stew, husband was furious that she had tried to get in the middle of it and wanted to call her and scream but I said no please don’t.

Then. Then. THEN. My mother calls.

EV: hello darling how are you doing?? (She always spoke like this, dear,  darling, my love sweetheart, etc sickly sweet stuff that honestly made me feel weird)

Me: I’m pretty good

EV: Nsister told me she spoke to you about the cleaning

Me: ya that was a bit annoying 

EV: I understand that but do you maybe think she has a point, maybe you got your cleaning habits from the *other* side of the family. (She mentions a family member’s name in particular who is an absolute slob, I don’t want to say who or anything but this person is notorious in our family for their house being absolutely disgusting like old food, hygiene products, hoarding, garbage, you get the gist, my house was messy at best I swear but it did not warrant this and it set me off)

I hang up on her.

They both called me several times the next few days and I was NOT ready to talk to them, hubby and I talked it over and decided we would not trusting them to confide in at all!!! Especially with anything based within our marriage. 

I did eventually answer the phone and the first thing out of Nsisters mouth was “oh no, you guys didn’t get in a fight about the cleaning did you?!” In a sickly sweet, I’m-so-fake-sorry voice, No bitch, actually we didn’t, but she and EV were obviously trying to get us to. 

There was quite a few times when both of them tried to talk to my husband about me behind my back and also did it to me about him, trying to get us into a fight with each other but really we only got upset with them. 

We now have a wonderful cleaning routine and an even better marriage ❤️

These are red flags people! 🚩 family members who do this to you are toxic!!! This kind of passive aggressive behaviour is not ok!!!",JUSTNOMIL
"JNMIL and FIL have gotten wind that we were unhappy with someone in our family talking trash at our reception. Nobody to my knowledge has name dropped, but since she wasn't by any means subtle with her statements, they made the (correct) assumption that it was MIL. They have made several ugly phone calls full of accusations ranging from me just trying to drive a wedge in between everyone to me having hated them from the start. We were going to wait to have a discussion with them about it and go NC/VLC until the post-wedding stress had settled a bit, but kinda feeling like this has prompted an immediate response. 

I have written this out to send to JNMIL, as I feel like I express myself better in writing and want to leave no room for misinterpretation on our wishes. Just looking for a sounding board on whether I sound like a bitch or not. 

 ""Since you value direct confrontation, and since I am not cowardly by any stretch of the word, I will try to make this as respectful as possible.

The accusation that I have never liked you is ludicrous. Despite hurtful statements and actions on your part in the early days of mine and DH's relationship, I moved past it and have frequently gone out of my way, as has DH, to be supportive of both you and FIL, whether it was watching your house at last minutes notice or supporting you both through FIL's diagnosis. Let me remind you that we both called out of work, drove multiple hours, and spent 12 hours in hospital with you while he had surgery. I did tons of research and legwork to find you reliable care and ensure that he was receiving the best treatment options. I spoke to doctors and nurses on your behalf. I have intervened during ER visits to get him faster care. I am not the type of person to go that far out of my way for someone that I do not like. I will not waste that kind of energy. On the other hand, since you have moved away and we are no longer useful to you on a regular basis, we have both noticed how seldom we hear from you. I'm sure you can imagine how hurtful it has been to hear complaints that we never call or visit while you rarely reach out yourselves. I have watched DH hurt over why BIL and SIL seem to get so much of your attention while he receives so little. Despite encouraging him to discuss this with you, he has never felt comfortable doing so as he felt it would lead to more argument instead of parents hearing and understanding a very real need of their child. I suspect he is probably right. 

We were both saddened and hurt that neither of you showed much enthusiasm or interest in our wedding plans. I'll also remind you that we adjusted our plans for our dream wedding when we realized how sick FIL was, and moved the wedding a year forward and two states closer because it was more important to BOTH of us to have DH's dad present as well, and as you know, his recovery has never been 100% assured. However, given the weight of his diagnosis, we assumed that you were both preoccupied and didn't think too much about it. 

I have watched DH beat himself up trying to please you both. I have watched him bend over backwards for your approval. I have watched him cry and cried with him over things that have been said to or about him. We have both watched while BIL is praised for every move he makes, while major events in DH's life (like a wedding) go practically without notice. It says a lot that you refused the seat of honor traditionally given to the groom's family at the wedding, something that was noticed by many other guests. Whether or not DH told his father (and he did) about specific seating arrangements, there were two coordinators on hand to assist with seating who would have pointed you to the correct seats had you chosen to ask. 

During the reception, in addition to pointing out some of the more colorful comments that you made, several of our guests mentioned that you were quite rude to them when they tried to assist you in finding a drink. Many people also took notice that neither of you even spoke to me at the reception until you left, and asked me why you were acting so standoffish. None of our guests knew you, and none of them have any reason to lie to us about something that serious. Additionally, the fact that you automatically assumed that my statement, which included no names, was about you indicates to me that either you know you said something to that effect, or you don't remember and are worried that you did. Otherwise, why assume? My family was also present, and it could just have easily been directed towards one of them. A third option is that you were simply looking for a reason to be accusatory towards me, which also says plenty on its own. 

I have also been accused of slighting BIL during our pictures. Previously we had discussed only including parents in formal photos, because my brother, who is currently serving overseas, was unable to attend and we did not want him and his wife to feel left out. Hence my tone of surprise when we deviated from our plan. But hey, it was DH's wedding too and if he wanted it, that's fine. Apologies if you felt that was disrespectful. As you also are aware, we have received devastating news regarding our chances of having a baby, and have spent many nights crying over it, so interacting with heavily pregnant people (SIL) is a sensitive thing for both of us, though not the fault of anyone else. 

Whether or not you intended it, your words and actions have been greatly hurtful to both of us, and for the sake of both of our mental health, we feel that a break from contact between our families is best until a full apology has been made and we have received counseling on how to emotionally move past these things. As such, we will not be responding to any calls/texts/emails etc from you or anyone else regarding this. We will always be here in case of emergencies, but we wish to keep our distance otherwise until healing has taken place on both sides. Please respect our wishes in this. Also please take note that neither of us has called either of you names nor spoken to you harshly, and as we are all adults, we expect the same standards of respectful communication from you as well.""

Update: after discussing it following my vent/getting this off my chest here, we've decided a few things after reading all the advice given here. 
1. We are going to ignore the stalker-like calls and texts until things calm down.
2. Once they have stopped, husband will be the one to deliver the message.
3. It will be short, sweet, and devoid of emotion on our part.
4. We will be blocking them on mobile/social media following that until further notice and until we are ready to try open discussion with them.
5. We will, however, not block them on our land line because a) we don't know how, and b) we can screen calls easily with our vm setup, but they will still be able to notify us if/when FIL's terminal diagnosis reaches the end.

Update 2: I really appreciate the kind words. I'm new to dealing with this type of family dynamic head-on like this and we both have been feeling super overwhelmed and hurt, despite this kind of behavior being not-completely out of character for MIL. We're just not used to it being directed at us so forcefully.",JUSTNOMIL
"LTL, FTP. All that jazz. Between my JustNoMom, Mostly JustNoDad, and my totally, absolutely JustNoMIL, this was only a matter of time. As you can infer, my life is a shit show. Thankfully, my husbands spine is very shiny and we’re very much on the same page. This is mostly a BEC moment. TLDR at the bottom. 

I (formally) married the love of my life over the weekend and while it was one of the happiest days of my life, my mom knows how to really piss me off. We had a specific request for all of our guests not to take photos during the ceremony and until after our first dance. We also asked our guests not to post any photos on social media to respect the family and friends that did not attend and allow us to share our special day with them ourselves. My husband and I are very adamant about not posting every single little thing online and wanted to be the ones to share OUR special day. 

We paid a photographer to take photos and didn’t want those classic photos of people holding out their phones and iPads to take photos and completely ruining thousands of dollars worth of photos. None of the guests had a problem with this and everyone for the most part stayed off of their phones for mostly the entire night, which was awesome... except for my mom. 

I’m not sure what happened during the ceremony as I was solely focused on my D(ear)H, but while we were getting photos done onsite both DH and I caught my mom taking photos 3 separate times. Each time she would immediately put down her camera, knowing she was doing something she was asked not to do. I had even expressed to her the night before at the rehearsal where she was taking pictures, “you better get all the pictures you’re gonna get now, because you aren’t getting any tomorrow.” Knowing I needed to be stern with her because this isn’t the first time her taking photos and posting them online was an issue.

Cut to the reception, before our first dance and I once again catch her taking photos. To which I once again ask her to please stop. Since she wasn’t in the photographers way and wasn’t really causing an issue, I let it slide but told her I didn’t want her posting anything online. She then got snippy with me and childishly took pictures of me telling her not to take pictures and post them online.  

Later on in the night, when I was finally ready to change out of my dress (full buttons up the back and part of the sleeves), I had called in one of my bridesmaids and sister to help me get it off. DH tells me shortly after when coming into the room that my dad had actually told my mom to come in and help and her response was “she can struggle herself since she wants to be a b****.” Thanks mom. 

The rest of the night, nothing happens besides JNMIL making a complete fool of herself, but that’s another story in itself. The next morning I wake up to a FULL STREAM of photos my mom posted of the wedding. I immediately comment, “I specifically asked you not to post photos, please take these down.” Her justification was that she didn’t post any photos of my dress. Which totally wasn’t the point. She continues to try and argue with me and I finally respond with “you know what, it’s fine. Since you can’t be trusted to follow simple instructions, you won’t be invited to anything anymore.” Cue her deleting the post entirely. 

For the next few hours I am bombarded with texts from my sister and dad. Long story short, my parents have now cut me from their lives because my mom can’t follow a simple instruction and “I’m disrespectful” because “who doesn’t allow people to take photos at a wedding” and “how will we ever remember your wedding” when I said we’d be happy to share our PROFESSIONAL pictures with everyone when we get them back. I said that’s their choice and left it at that. 

There is a long history with me and my parents and them thinking I’m a spoiled brat because I don’t let them walk all over me. It’s been an ongoing issue for the last few years and I’ve barely spoken to them since moving 13 hours away almost a year ago. It doesn’t hurt my feelings any that they don’t want to be in my life over something so trivial. This is just one of her more tame, BEC moments. My mom is very manipulative and narcissistic. Reasons why I was able to spot those characteristics in my MIL from a mile away. 

TLDR; JNMom doesn’t know how to follow instructions and I’m disrespectful for being upset after asking her numerous times not to do something and her doing it anyways.",JUSTNOMIL
"This is my first time posting. So I will give you some backstory.

My husband and I moved in with my in laws. They asked us to do so after their only child gas a major career change. When we agreed, we did not know you basically have to wait for a resident to die before you can get a house in this school district.

Since we've been here, I've had some major health problems that have put a damper on our plans.

I am getting ready for a colonoscopy so I have to be on a liquid diet. I'm currently at 50 hours without food because I completely forgot to eat dinner last night and by the time i remembered it was too late.

I have an allergy to something I jello and the two juices I was allowed to have  So I have been barely surviving today on soda and tea. 

She knows I can't eat today and I have been cranky because of it. She made herself some hotdogs and just kept exclaiming how good they tasted. 

Maybe I am just hangry but it pissed me off so much. I'm clearly miserable and she just was being so petty.

I did end up telling her if she kept on karma is going to get her and she is going to choke on that hotdog. 

She glared at me.

I don't have time for someone that makes fun of my misery",JUSTNOMIL
" I moved into FDH’s house mid February, but I didn’t initially bring a lot of my things, because we knew what was coming in the next couple months. His job requires him to live on one of the properties he manages and we just downsized. It is a bit less spacious as our last place, but it’s much more functional. We got to gut it to make it what we wanted and added some high end tech-y things that makes it awesome. However, we only had 30 days to gut, remodel and move, so not enough time to go through everything and get rid of what we wouldn’t have room for. Our garage is so packed we can’t even walk into it. We’re making slow but steady progress. 

   
 

I’ve recently dropped the rope with my family, so when Mommasaurus Rex called me a couple weeks ago, on a Friday and asked if I wanted to get together, I asked her to come to me instead. I said she could come to our house this weekend to talk about the things I’ve been going through and help me with my rose garden. (So beautiful this year!) She said maybe, she’d let me know. Lol /s. 

   
 

I’m not changing any of my plans if and when she decides to come. 

   
 

On Saturday evening, I texted to see if she was coming because I wanted to give FDH enough time to plan to not be around if didn’t want to be. Much later that evening she said she still had to check with someone. Lol /s

   
 

Sunday morning she texted she’d come over around 1pm-ish. Haha, right. 1pm-ish means 2-2:30 in MR Land. I just asked her to let me know when she’s on her way. She texted around 1:15 and she’s bringing some of my stuff. That’s nice of her, but it’s her passive aggressive way of pushing me to move my things out. (I explained below why it’s taking a while to move my stuff.) So, it’s a 30 minute drive from her house to ours and over an hour later she knocked on my door. Lol /s

   
 

We go to grab my stuff out of her car and I commented on how it’s odd that she had parked a block away. MR said, “oh, I went to the open house down the street. I want to downsize from our (5 bedroom) house because it’s too big to upkeep (she has a maid) and you know how much work it takes to keep up all the gardens on our land.” (she has gardeners.)

   
 

Wat. 

   
 

There are several things here that are nails on a chalkboard. 

   
 

* She didn’t bother to let me know she’d be late or ask if the extended timeframe would affect our visit or if it’s ok with my schedule. Am I surprised by this? Absolutely not.  
 
* Mommasaurus Rex has been bugging me for the last several months to get the rest of my things out of her house and I explained that due to the medical issues I’m dealing with, that’s not really immediately possible. What I have moved over, FDH has been there to help me. FDH works 60 hours a week minimum. It’s going to take some scheduling. We’re doing our best! She didn’t agree, but reality is reality. I know it’s her house and I’m not dragging my feet. Her bringing me some of my things is nice but still annoying. I don’t have room for it yet. If she wants my stuff out, I’ve let her know that’s totally fine, but I’d need help. Help getting rid of things in our house and garage, and help getting rid of my things BEFORE I pack it up to move them. Does my Narc family offer to help? Of course not.   
 
* She stopped and went to an open house *in our neighborhood. One fucking block away from us*. Hell no! She wants to downsize and she also needs my room? I know this is just a controlling power play so I’m dealing with it as best I can. It’s just annoying because, leaving out her living room, dining room, kitchen, and master suite, she has: a guest room, craft room, family room, office, a huge play room with beds for when her grandkids come over, my old room, and a GUEST HOUSE filled with ALL my brothers’ shit and her antiques. But noooo, she HAS to have me clean out my stuff so she can downsize and have my room. For what? What other type of room are you imagining you’ll turn that space into while you’re also downsizing?? A dragon and unicorn grooming facility? 

   
 

Her visit was mostly tolerable, but very surface-y. I felt very judged and I clearly got the impression that she doesn’t think any of my choices are the right ones. 

   
 

Case in point:

   
 

While we were pruning the rose bushes, she said, “if you’re still with him in the winter, I can come over to help you cut back your roses for spring.”

   
 

Ok, I needed to take a deep breath at that comment to not blurt out our plans to elope in the spring. None of my family knows how serious we are. None know we’re engaged. I plan to keep it that way because they don’t deserve to know details about my personal life. They’ll just use the information to hurt me. It shouldn’t annoy me that she’s assuming we’ll break up, but it does because the last couple relationships I’ve been in were 5+ years long. Why she would think we’re not serious after I moved into his home is beyond me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to make it clear to her that besides the fact that I'm dealing with life-limiting medical issues, I'm financially starting over after back surgery, not working for a year, and recently quitting the job I did get after recovering, due to abuse in the workplace. I have an interview for a job I really want tomorrow morning, so I'm excited about that, but that is irrelevant. Also, my parents are wealthy and could afford to help, but they definitely wouldn't give me a penny even if it would keep me from starving.",JUSTNOMIL
"Characters are grandfathered in, been here a minute.  

So, backstory.  Pacha has been in love with Yzma's parents old house for umpteen million years.  I love the land more than the house, but we are in the process of renovating that out.  We tried to buy it 15ish years ago, but Yzma wasn't ready to let go.  Her father's clothes were still in the closet, we couldn't move any furniture, etc.  

Well, we purchased the house close to a year ago and we are doing all of the renovations ourselves.  Now is the time where the original hardwood floors are refinished.  Pacha has not quite mastered the information diet yet, so apparently told Yzma that the floors were getting redone.  I have had a vision of the redesign of this house for a million years in my head, that includes dark floors.  Yzma is a terrible decorator.  She hoards stupid collectible figurines and puts them in red oak china cabinets.  Everywhere.  She has like 20, and I'm not shitting you.  Titanic collectibles, local college collectibles, magnolia collectibles, etc.  All of the walls are white, with red oak trim.  

Cue Yzma saying ""oh, I'm sure it will look good.  Don't go too dark."" Don't go too dark you say?  Now, it's on.  I wanted dark to begin with, now, you have just cemented my position.  I have found some of the darkest possible stains and we have chosen [""Dark Walnut""](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Varathane-8-oz-Dark-Walnut-Classic-Wood-Interior-Stain-339744/305502026).

"The past two days I have posted and today it has come to a head. MIL took me aside today when I came to get my son after work. She went off on me about being immature and several other things. She also got very petty about my family. I am so stuck right now with how much we rely on them. This is exactly what I was afraid of and no one listened to me. I honestly question if trying to rebuild my marriage is worth putting up with MIL. We can't move, I can't get another childcare provider rn, and I need to work or else we lose our house. I'm at my wits end with this situation with MIL and I know if I just tred lightly for a while things will be okay, but its only been 2 months that I have been dealing with them on a daily basis and there has been so much drama and crap that I can't handle until February. I'm seriously just so done it makes me question if my marriage is worth saving if I have to continuously deal with this.",JUSTNOMIL
"So an update. Again, this will be a long one. 

Firstly I want to thank everyone who took the time to comment and advise in my first post (hit up BB, I'm not sure how to link posts on mobile), I let BF read the post and the comments and he says that he's glad I made the post to get advice from other people who have experienced the same, similar, and worse, and he thanks you for the perspective and advice as well. I've taken all of your advice into consideration and have constructed a long message to send to my mum after getting some input on it here. Thank you again, you've all helped beyond belief. Thank you also to the mod team for helping me out where the title was concerned.

After reading the message to BF, and sending it to my best friend, and now that BF's at work, I'm worried that I'm starting to JADE, which is another reason I'm making this post. You have to understand that my mum has never been like this before, so it's hard for me to see her as toxic, as she's been my only parent, but I'm trying hard to stick to my guns and support BF as much as humanly possible. 

Just a quick disclaimer for clarification; when I tell mum about consulting BF about spending time with DD, I do not ""ask him"", as it makes it sound like I am asking his permission, which I am not. We discuss with/check with/consult each other.

-------------

Onto today, I asked my mum to bring DD back for a certain time as BFs mum wanted to spend time with her. I'll transcribe the messages because we're Scottish and she types in slang and abbreviations, it's quite hard to read. 

Me; I'd like you to bring DD back for 1pm. BF'S mum is coming to see her.

Mum; Ok.

Mum; Had to buy formula, as what I had wasn't enough to last, so I will get the cash off you when I bring her back. Got it at X Supermarket for £7.97. 

Me; That's fine, I'll give you the money when you get here. 

Mum; If you could have it ready, as I won't be staying. I'll just be dropping DD off and leaving again.

Me; So you're not even gonna bother to talk to me to resolve this for the sake of DD? 

Me; I'm not having this, everything was fine when I was pregnant and now all of this bullshit has started. I'm not having DD being privy to this, because I refuse to expose her to arguments and shittiness, that's why I told you and your BF not to argue when she was there. This isn't fair on anyone involved, and the sooner this is resolved the better it'll be for everyone.

Mum; It's nothing to do with DD, or for the sake of DD. We are fine with each other, it's you two that are being funny (out of character) with me, as you two agreed I'd have DD Sundays and Mondays and now you're changing your minds to suit you. (Sidenote, even if that was the case, we're allowed to do that because we're her fucking parents)

Me; No, I told you that I had spoken to BF about you having her Sundays and Mondays, and he had her in his arms and he told me, word for word, that because of his work pattern he doesn't get to spend very much time with her, and that he would think about it. We never spoke about it again until Saturday when you brought it up, I will pinky promise you that because it's the truth. It's not been my intention to be funny with you, or changing my mind when it suits me. We've had 5 weeks to get into some kind of pattern and that's still developing around you and nana having her, BF's family and our friends wanting to see her too. This is still really early days so it's hard to have a schedule like this and stick to it completely until the ""newness"" of DD wears off and people aren't round as often.

Me; This is why I wanted to talk about this in person with you, because wires have obviously been crossed and messages can misconstrue meanings and tones, this only leads to more crossed wires and that leads to more issues. Please talk to me when you come here, this is hurting me like fuck and I want to fix it.

-Half an hour passes- 

Mum; Leaving here now. 

So she never bothered to respond to me asking her to talk to me face to face, so I think that maybe she'll choose to sit down and talk once she gets here and we can start to resolve it. If that happened, I wouldn't be here again. 

She arrives just before 1PM with my nana, who helps her up our stairs with the pram and promptly walks back out again, not even a hello, not a word uttered. My mum proceeds to tell me which bottles have been sterilised, and which ones need sterilised, ask me for the money for the formula, and walks out. 

You guys, I broke. In that moment I genuinely felt so alone, and I cried my heart out while BF held me together. She knows there's damage done to our bond, but it can't mean that much if she's blatantly refusing to talk to me outside of the required engagement. I'm absolutely devastated and heartbroken that she would act like this. I mean, at least the first time she gave me an excuse. She didn't even tell me she loved me before she walked out.

So after I had my cry, I got mad. Like super mad, and I read over all of the comments you guys had given me, and I wrote her a message in Docs that I haven't sent yet, I wanted some input on it so far because I'm not sure if it's too harsh, or if I've included enough. So fair warning, this is where it gets ridiculously long. 

--------

The message; (this is your chance to turn back, this is REALLY long)

This is incredibly difficult to do, but given that you refuse to talk about this to attempt to resolve it, you're leaving me no choice but to do it this way. 


The way that you have been acting is completely unreasonable; you've created this issue despite me telling you several times that it's not the case. 


1; BF and I did not further discuss you having DD overnight on Sundays and Mondays, the next time it was brought up was in our house on Saturday after family member's birthday. BF gave the go-ahead for you to take her, but I didn't hear him say that, which is why I said to you that I was fine with it but you'd need to clarify with him. And instead, you got pissy and told me it didn't matter.


2; Yours and Nana's blatant disregard for BF as a parent needs to stop. Now. BF and I agreed, on our own, before DD was born, that we would check with each other when it came to anyone coming over, having DD during the day, and overnight. This decision was made to avoid any crossed wires or mixed up plans. Just because I carried her for 9 months and I gave birth to her, does not mean that BF is less of a parent than I am. I understand that because my own dad was never around, you never had reason to clarify with him when it came to me, but BF made a choice to stick by me when I told him that I was pregnant, and he has. This is why I want him included in decisions where DD is concerned, because I never want her to feel like I did about my dad.


3; This blatant disregard does not just affect BF. We are a team, and a united one at that. You and nana saying ""you shouldn't have to ask him"" is disregarding his status as her parent, and you have made him feel absolutely awful. He feels persecuted because he wants to be a team with me, he feels like he is not considered, and that he is a problem. The audacity of the question, ""do you think he would ask you if BF's mum wanted to take DD overnight"" is astounding. Of course he would consult me, because that's what we agreed to do, and it's what we have done since before DD was born. He checks with me before he goes out with friends, he checks with me before friends come round, and I do the same with him. Why? Because it avoids any mixed up/overlooked plans. It is not asking permission, it's being considerate and checking first. This disregard for him also extends to me. He did not make this decision alone, so for you to tell me that I shouldn't have to ask him undermines a decision that both of us made, so you have also disregarded, disrespected and undermined me, as well. 


4; I refuse to be gaslit anymore. Gaslighting is when someone calls you out for doing wrong, and you make them into the problem so that they feel bad and apologise, and also question themselves any future time you've potentially done wrong, this is toxic, and it is also mentally abusive (Google gaslighting if you don't believe this). I told you on Saturday that I will not play middle man anymore, because putting me in between you and BF is not fair. You accused me of being in a horrible mood, when in reality, I was not. I'm just sick of this tension. So, I called you out on unfair behaviour, and you made me the problem, and made it my fault. 

Another example of this is you telling me that BF and I are ""being funny"" with you, and ""changing our minds to suit us."" This is untrue. As stated above, we did not discuss you having DD every Sunday and Monday night further until Saturday, but you've got it in your head that we have changed our minds after we agreed to that, which is untrue because we agreed on nothing. You, your BF and I discussed DD spending Sundays and Mondays, and I said that it was fine by me, but it would need to be discussed with BF. As I have, every time she has been requested overnight/during the day. I discussed it with BF that night when he got home, and he had DD in his arms and said to me that he would have to think about it, which I told you when I saw you next. It was NOT brought up between BF and I again until you brought it up on Saturday. But because this is not what you want to hear, you have made BF and I the problem for ""being funny"" when we have done nothing of the sort.


5; As for nana, frankly I'm hurt. The blasé way she acted in the house by just walking straight back out without uttering a single word has cut deep, and I'm honestly angry that she wouldn't even attempt to talk about this. Whereas you, I expected this sort of behaviour because you wait until I can't take it anymore and I run back and apologise for everything, this is also toxic and manipulative. You once said when I was younger and we had fallen out, ""I knew you'd come back when you needed something."" Did you ever stop to consider that I just needed my mum? You used to get so angry at me for running away from my problems instead of fixing them, and here I am, trying to fix a problem and you ran away from it. Twice. 


6; So the conclusion. As of today, because of how petulant, immature and childish you and nana have been acting, by avoiding this issue like it doesn't exist, because of disregarding BF and I as parents, and undermining decisions that both of us have made, and treating him like he is subpar to me, and gaslighting both of us to the point where WE feel like the problem when we know fine well we are not, DD will not be spending any more nights between you or nana. 

And before you accuse me of using her as a weapon against you, you need to realise that she is 5 weeks old. Despite my knowing that it was early days for her to be spending away from me and BF, and having clarified with the Health Visitor that it was okay to do so, I granted you that time with her because I knew that her having a relationship with you and nana was imperative. Look up object permanence to see how this can affect a child still developing. 5 weeks is not enough time to establish a well structured and permanent schedule, around family and friends coming over to see her, her staying overnight at yours and Nana's, and work patterns. We are first time parents, and I realise that through this we have made a mistake by trying to establish that permanent pattern too quickly, and now you have become entitled to my child. Despite complaining about how nana done the same to you where I was concerned, and you are now acting in like. 

Until you can come to me like an adult, and sit with me and BF to resolve this issue. Until you can treat BF with the respect he deserves as DD's father. And until you can treat me like an adult capable of making decisions for herself, and her daughter, DD will no longer be spending nights anywhere but at home. I am not saying you cannot see her or spend time with her, but if you'd like to continue spending time and bonding with your granddaughter, and repairing the damage between you and your daughter, you can come to the house, or I can bring her to you.

You have made me feel so isolated and alone, to the point where, because nana is acting the same way as you are, I feel like I have no family to turn to. You are the one I go to for everything, and you have taken that away. You have made me feel like the bond between you and I is insignificant, because if our bond meant anything to you, you would swallow your pride and talk to me and BF to resolve this. I feel like you are so inconsiderate to where I am mentally, because of how scattered my hormones and emotions are, and the fact that I am still in the risk percentage for developing Postnatal Depression, I feel like you don't care about any of that at all. You told me that when my baby was born, everyone's attention would be on her instead of me, and you're right, but I still had a support network for when I needed help. I guess I don't have that anymore. I never expected my own mother to cast me aside though, and that hurts me beyond comprehension, you've hurt me beyond belief. I never expected you to act like this, and force my hand into a decision that I never, ever wanted to have to make.

I don't really need to add anything to this post, so I'll conclude with another thank you for all of the advice I've been given.

"Right so my relationship with my MIL is very rocky. We've had a major fallout over my IL's controlling behaviour a year ago and she's been in my DH's ear ever since always finding a reason to complain about me. Lately, it seems to have calmed down and y'all she even PRAISED me to my DH (probably because he started defending me and finally told them that if they don't treat me right he'll go LC). So my DH and I went to a wedding in my IL's city (we live in a different country BTW) and stayed with them. He had to go back to work but convinced me to stay at my IL's for a week longer with my DS. I agreed because it's a chance for my DS and I to catch some sun (weather here is lovely compared to where we live) and my IL's work all the time anyway and I'll only have to interact with them in the evenings. So everything's  been going okay until today and I'm not sure if I'm overreacting. I've been craving a  traditional dish that I can't get where I live so I asked my BIL where is the best place to order from (and offered to order some for him but he declined, no one else was home then). MIL comes back and my BIL asks her where she usually orders from because I wanted some and she comes in and tells me that I won't be ordering anything because she's bought ingredients for dinner already and I'm going to eat it with them. I jokingly tell her dinner won't be for at least another 3 hours and I'll surely be hungry by then so she has nothing to worry about. She replies saying oh well eat something we have in the house then, don't order anything. Now, I get that she could be annoyed that she's cooking dinner and I want to eat a takeaway but once I reassured her that I'll eat it too I don't see what her problem is. Like I'm an adult. I can decide what I'll eat, you're not my mum and even my mum doesn't tell me what to eat anymore. It's not like she's going to pay for it either and I feel like she's told me to eat something we have at home just to provoke me to say something so that she can complain to my DH. Also it wouldn't be such a big deal if it wasn't for the fact the issue I had with my MIL and FIL was that they were telling me what to eat, how to spend my money and how to raise my son and basically kept complaining that I do everything wrong because I don't do it their way and I feel that they're starting to do it again. Am I overreacting? Was she right to say that?",JUSTNOMIL
"For starters, I have dealt with 4 years of foolishness from my MIL. I've read and reread various lines from this thread and finally things have come to a point that I feel like I need some advice.

When I met my SO, I had come from a seriously abusive relationship (think attempted murder type abuse). At the time my kid was 10.  My SO foolishly told this information to his family, because he didn't yet realize he didn't have to answer a million invasive questions. Cue the phone calls from not only MIL but the entire ""family."" They even refer to themselves as The Family. I was there for one phone call, hearing his grandma say I would just end up going back to the man that tried to kill me because ""all of THOSE people are damaged goods"".  MIL demanding he break up with me because she didn't want her son being around when my ex came back to finish the job. 

MIL finding out details of my SO and my work schedules just so she could call and grill him when I wasn't home. To complicate matters, my FIL was actively dying of a serious thing. It seemed to ramp up MIL anxiety, and she in turn wanted to dump that on my SO. He went LC.

Here's where annoying turned into WTF. My SO is military. She called his command and told them that FIL had died, call your mom. After having a grave discussion with his CO where they broke this news, he called his house and FIL answers. Surprise! Not dead. Mommy just wanted to hear his voice and knew she could get him to phone home if she lied to HIS COMMAND. 

It was a dramatic shitshow. We visited so he could see his dad. I moved sun and stars so we could get to the actual funeral when he did pass. The funeral was nuts, it was really just a monument to The Family and not to FIL. After the drama of the funeral and a pretty terrible thing said to SO from MIL, SO has gone completely NC. That was 2 years ago. We have been married since then (surprise elopement yall) we have a nice life and the NC remains. 

MIL sends a birthday card to me and SO despite us requesting her to stop and that has been the most communication for 2 years. She also called the chaplain of his command to tell them she was worried about him and believes that I am abusing him. They called him into their office and he straightened it out.

However, this month my SO was away from home with his job and not reachable by normal means. He emailed me to let me know that MIL had contacted the Red Cross to put through an emergency message claiming his ""Grandma has died. Call your mom."" G-ma is just as bad as MIL. But she's alive and well, it was some random relative he doesn't really know. I expressed a fear that her lying to the Red Cross will make them think it's not to be taken seriously if something bad actually does happen.

YALL. My mom died a week later. I had to go through Red Cross to contact him and get him home. It was scary and no one took it seriously as I had predicted. That was on memorial day. I'm still grieving. Here's where I need advice, he never actually told his mom that he didn't want to speak to her again.
He just stopped. I'm more than a little scared that she would go to such lengths, and keeps doing things to meddle with his job. Its stalking behavior. 

I believe he should do more to make it clear that this is unacceptable. Contacting an international aid society just to get you to call is psycho. Calling your job and saying your dad died to get you to call is also psycho. There's been years of stuff like this. I think he needs to tell her to never contact him again, either through a court order or a certified letter.",JUSTNOMIL
"Sorry for the length, I've just been thinking about this a lot and it just sorta poured out of me.

I have posted here before but I've deleted all those posts out of being paranoid of being identified. Not sure if anyone would remember, but she's the one that flipped her shit on me/SO because I got a tattoo and told my SO that he ""ruined Christmas"" by only being able to get to her house a couple days before Christmas (and stay through christmas, etc).  All of this started after one giant blow up, and now any time any of these episodes happen, she goes into a tantrum, cries and tells everyone that her family is ruined, and verbally abuses SO and the rest of the family, especially FIL. Whenever I do something that upsets her, she does this to my SO because she knows I'm not going to just sit there and take it, but he takes it really hard so I HATE that she does it.

Last year on his birthday, we had a giant blow up over nothing. They came to visit and we all went out with some friends for some wine, and she had a giant attitude the entire time. At one point, she was just sitting in the corner, INSIDE with her sunglasses on, looking at her phone and not talking to anyone. All because SO asked her not to share a story that he had just told her. We went home and they just had it out in their native language, while meanwhile, I'm sitting off the the side listening and trying to follow the conversation. 

This is what happens EVERY TIME she has a blow up. She yells at them. She cries. We have to have a ""family meeting"" that lasts for hours where everyone apologizes for hurting her feelings and she apologizes for freaking out. Then everyone is soooo optimistic that it won't happen again! She's learned her lesson and apologized guys! /s

Only this time, I had it out with her too. They had their talk, and then SO and I went into our room and talked. I told him I was sick of her treating him this way. I told him that all of his mental health problems have started since that first big blow up and if he went to a therapist, 90% of what he'd be talking about is her. And that I can't just sit here and watch her treat him like shit, make him feel like shit, make him cry and have anxiety and just be on edge all the time because he's afraid of what mommy is going to say about everything. I just can't take it. I was like crying-yelling all of this because I was just sooo sick of every single family event turning into this and no one doing anything about it. I've told him all of this before but this time it just came pouring out because I just couldn't believe she'd travel all the way up here for his birthday just to shit all over everything. 

After that, I went out and talked to her and told her everything I felt. How I was tired of her treating him this way, how I was tired of her being so mean and cruel to him whenever she was unhappy. And I asked her to come directly to me if she had a problem with something I was doing because she doesn't get to just yell at him about my behavior. If she wants me to be like her daughter then she can talk to me like one of her kids, but I won't deal with the abuse. She actually was receptive to it all, except for trying to side track into the tattoo conversation again lol.

So now I'm sitting here almost a year later. Nothing crazy has happened since. There hasn't been any big blow ups. There hasn't been any big fights. I do think she was dealing with some undiagnosed anxiety, (which is an explanation, not an excuse, I know), and has since figured out a better way of coping. But I still get mad anxious about telling her anything. And it's not about me, I could truly not give a fuck about what she thinks about my grown ass doing anything. But the abuse that she hurls at SO when she has these blow ups just throws him into such a funk. He gets depressed and irritable and is just hurting so much, which my heart can't bear. There is such a direct correlation between his mental health and his mom's behavior. 

So my question is....will I ever get over this anxiety regarding her? Her blow ups are sporadic enough to where SO doesn't think he needs therapy (he'll start feeling better and then say it's not a big deal...then it happens all over again), so I fear that he won't ever stop taking to heart what his mom says, which in turn is what stresses me out. How long without a blow up can I feel like the waters are actually starting to calm? Is she truly getting better or is this just an unusual lull??",JUSTNOMIL
"Sooo first time poster, long time lurker, all that jazz.

My partner (25M) and I (21F) have been together for a little over a year. Before I met his parents, I was thoroughly warned about his mom. Shes your typical JNMIL; controlling, overbearing, rude, negative, probably hates me. Im okay with that though because I hate her too. On top of being a typical JN, my partner's mom is a pathological liar, and Im convinced she suffers from borderline personality disorder. My SO spent much of his life growing up being extremely emotionally abused and occasionally physically abused. His dad was very lax and never stood up for him, and acted as though my SO was just a nuisance. 

Currently, my partner and I have a one month old baby. I also recently found out that he has been emotionally cheating for about two months. We are very broken right now but attending therapy and still living together, trying to make things work for our son. Of course, JNMIL has to insert herself into our problems. It has been a slew of demands, stressful phone calls on SO's behalf, and constant insults. My SO is ""a fucking idiot"" and she doesnt understand how he ""can be such a fuck up."" Apparantly I am also a bitch who is only doing this to fuck over my partner. I lost it. This morning I sat down and sent her three quite aggressive messages telling her to stay tf out of my life. I need to know what I can expect?? Here are the messages:

""I love your son. Point blank. I love our child we have together. SO hurt me, again, and he needs to make up for that. We are working together to build back trust and to make sure LO is as happy and healthy as possible. He is OUR priority, not yours. This is not your relationship, and LO is not your child. I could make a million comments on how I think your parenting style is wrong, but I know that it is not my place to say such things. Why do you think that you are allowed to tell SO and I how to parent? How to be in a relationship? It is not your place.""

""Never once while this was all happening, not even while I was sobbing alone on the bathroom floor, I never thought to take SO's son away from him. SO is a part of my life, forever, whether we are dating or not. However, I have no reason to keep someone who is consistently negative, never has a single positive thing to say, always makes me feel judged and uncomfortable, and emotionally abuses the father of my child. I am absolutely fed up with hearing you talk to SO like he is lesser than you, and I am absolutely fed up with hearing the negative bullshit you say about me and my family. My parents have taken SO in and love him like their own son. You, on the other hand, act as though I am a bitch trying to steal your son, act consistently over controlling, and you insult me and my family. I am not ""screwing over"" your son, I am not planning on making SO ""cater to"" me (what the fuck? Why would you assume SO making up for breaking my heart is him ""catering"" to me?). It might shock you, but instead of ""Sister and [I] ran to Mommy and Daddy and made you look like an ass,"" I actually didnt tell a single person until SO and I spoke about it. Why is it fair for SO to talk about this situation with you and FIL but if I try talking about it with my parents, Im a bitch who is just trying to make SO look bad.""

""I want you to stay out of my life. I do not want to see you, I do not want to speak with you, I do not want you to contact me in any way, whatsoever. I am documenting everything that has been said within the past two days. If you cause problems in my relationship with the father of my child, you will be held accountable.""

Shes already tried phoning him and me several times but we're ignoring them for now. Im terrified of whats going to happen

Tldr: I sent some aggressive texts to my JNMIL demanding she stay out of my life. Im scared as fuck.

"Not sure if there's a cultural explanation, but MIL went to one of her vacation homes to help out BIL and her daughter after BIL's mom died from a terminal illness.  A couple days after BIL's mom died, MIL posted a bunch of selfies of them having fun, going out, and smiling on social media.  This struck me as inappropriate, given how recent the death was. Am I missing something? Why would BIL be doing this either? Is this considered appropriate by any culture?",JUSTNOMIL
"I [have](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/92fi6t/spoke_to_my_exnarcs_mother_on_the_phone_first/) [posted before about this abuse-enabling ex-MIL](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/7usvol/update_xmil_wont_acknowledge_me_but_wants_access/) and I had allowed her to [start writing my kids letters again](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/92zerj/my_exns_mothers_response_to_my_email_setting/) around Xmastime when her daughter reached out to see her nephews (my kids) for the first time ever since I split with their dad. Anyway, she wrote me an email last week, saying that she'll be in town on certain dates this month, and would we (me, and my 2 kids) like to meet her on a certain day/time/place? I responded by thanking her for expressing an interest in seeing my kids for the first time in 3 years and I let her know that it's hurtful to hear how often she's in town (she lives on the west coast) and has never before asked to see her grandkids! Anyway, I let her know that we already had plans for the exact day and time she asked about (my older kid has his best friend's birthday party to attend), but also I wasn't comfortable with the location she'd selected (it's nearby where I used to live with my ex-narc and a half-hour drive from where we currently live). I proposed that we select another time/day and let her know that I'd prefer if she was by herself (i.e., don't bring any ""surprises"" since my kids' dad hasn't seen them in 2.5 years and currently has zero access to them) and please don't mention their dad to them or bring him up. She simply wrote back ""another time, thankyou"" and that's it! No attempt to give options or ask ""hey, when is a good time or day for you guys?"" or even acknowledge one thing that I asked to mentioned in my response!! 

 

I AM FURIOUS!! But I am trying my best not to write her anything back. And I am tempted to cut off her penpal letters to my kids again. WTF? Who wants a gramma to be a penpal but won't visit when in town? They'd get better value out of having a penpal like someone who is their own age, but lives in another country and culture! She's the worst. Worst enabler, worst pollyanna manipulator martyr, and worst gramma. Thank you for this rant - advice and encouragement welcomed!!",JUSTNOMIL
"TL:Dr at bottom. Also, gentle advice/encouragement please. So 6 days ago our second daughter was born. Completely unexpected, wasn’t due until June 25th. We had been at the car dealership picking up DHs new truck and spending a little quality time shopping and going to lunch together. I’d been having contractions off and on for days and just felt kind of blah this day. On the way home I noticed contractions every 5 minutes apart, my doctor wanted me to come in when they were 8 minutes apart...we went in around 6pm and expected the contractions to stop like they had been doing before, they didn’t. By 10:13 our little girl was delivered via repeat C-section. DH didn’t call his mom and asked my parents not to call her either, they respected his wish and I was thankful no one let the old hag know. She’s the last person we wanted around. My parents and daughter came to see her for maybe 15 minutes and then left, it was nearly midnight by the time we were in the room. After a day my husband said he felt bad that he hadn’t told her yet, he’d told everyone else and she still didn’t know. I was fine if he never told her and I think deep down he would be okay with that too but didn’t want the word to slip out. I said to go ahead and tell her but she is NOT allowed to come up here right now. We’re staying with my parents while we have a house built, there’s not any room for her and no one wants her hanging around. He agreed and said it would probably be three weeks at this point because he would need to be off from work to keep her in line. Here’s where she starts to become my BEC. She’s texting me, I’m not answering, I don’t want to be on the phone with her for hours listening to her beg to come up, WE ARE NOT READY for her to visit. She posted a picture online before I could share my own, she didn’t tag us in the picture and she was responding to everyone like she was the one who just had a baby. No, I did. She sent my husband a text that said “congrats DAD”, he was pissed because he is adopting my oldest, he’s already a dad in his eyes. (I posted earlier about how she said this baby was “special”). Every post my husband has put up she’s commented under saying things like “granny wants to spoil me.” Great, good for you but we don’t want visitors, my parents aren’t getting special privileges because we’re staying with them, my dad held her for 10 minutes the first day we were home and that’s it. The other issues we have with her visiting is her overly fake “omg my baby” waterworks shit, not YOUR baby, she’s MINE. I don’t want her to come here and zone out and try to baby hog. I’m not comfortable with anyone really holding her right now. My children are miracle babies, I have half of a uterus and my chances of getting pregnant and carrying a baby are pretty low. I’m very selfish with my kiddos and it’s my damn right to be. It’s not about anyone else’s feelings and I don’t want to have to cater to her whining because “she waited so much longer and drove so far” I DONT GIVE A RATS ASS. Also, she smokes, when she comes up she’s not allowed to hold my preemie if she smells in anyway of cigarettes. 
We have boundaries in place and she will be reminded before she gets here and once she arrives. 


TL:DR just had a preemie, MIL was told not to come up until invited, don’t know how she’ll act when she gets here, I don’t like her, she smokes and don’t want her to hold baby let alone try to hog my baby, don’t want to hear her whining about having to wait and acting like she gets special privileges because she was made to wait to visit. DH is supportive of whatever I want and will put her in her place.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hello everyone! Been lurking for awhile. We currently live with my Bipolar MIL, urgh y'all remind me that I really DON'T have it that bad and that I'll have to share at some point about her shenanigans.

However, this is not about her. This is the story about when my mom came for a solo visit when my oldest son was about 18mo, so about 3 years ago, when we were living in an apartment by ourselves.

(Side note: She doesn't pull stuff when my dad or brother are with her because they shut her down REAL quick, and since this incident I've done a better job of shutting her down, too.)

She wasn't even in the car for 5 minutes when she commented about how I hadn't lost the baby weight yet. Whatever mom, you've been commenting on my weight since I hit puberty. I just ignored it and rolled my eyes since I really didn't care. Since it didn't bother me, she moved on to a neutral topic.

Over the course of the next few days, she proceeds to give me a TON of parenting advice. Being a first time mom at that point, I'm actually kind of glad for some of what she shares. I remind her that lil dude is different from me and my brother and it might not work with him like it did with us, but thanks anyway. She seems appeased.

However, the WTF moment happened on the last day of her visit. I had been having some issues with my car and didn't feel comfortable driving it all the way down to the airport to drop her off, so the plan was to wait till my husband got home and trade cars. When my mom learned about this plan, she lost it, beginning to rant about how my husband was a bad provider for me and lil dude because he didn't take my car into get fixed and how dare he not keep the two of us safe.

Um what now? For one thing, he doesn't drive my car. He didn't even know it was having issues yet; he just knew I wanted to switch cars and didn't question why because he's awesome and was busy at work. For another, how does that relate AT ALL to his ability to provide for us?

I looked her dead in the eyes and very firmly but calmly said, ""You will NOT speak about my husband that way, and if you do, you will no longer be welcome with us."" She got real quiet and never said another word about him  the rest of her visit.

When I shared her comments with my husband, he laughed and said, ""I always thought she didn't like me. Now I know for sure."" So thanks, mom, for confirming our suspicions!

Have a happy day y'all, and may your spines stay shiny!",JUSTNOMIL
"Thought came up because of a comment that I made on someone else's post.  Staples, despite not being a narc, has never been able to accept the blame for her actions - a trait that I guarantee she picked up from her own justnos in her family.

See, Staples was all but formally raised by her German immigrant grandparents once her older sister passed away.  From that, I've especially noticed that in my childhood she was exceptionally similar to traditional European abusive behaviors that now she condemns (hmmm...)  This is relevant, btw, for later.

Anywho, was raised Catholic.  Hated going to church all the time, but what's important is that Staples and father were always strict about Lent.  Father is much more Catholic than Staples (adult convert), but in this case he was never as bad as Staples was.

When I was 10, I gave up chocolate for Lent.  Simple enough - only Lent began early February that year, so that meant one of my main supplies of chocolate was ""hidden"" from me.  Aka, everyone knew where it was.

Now, Staples and brother were particularly nasty the day after Valentine's, taunting me with their truffles and talking about how good they were.  Being 10 and severely depressed, I ran off crying - but not before I heard Staples scold brother for taking it too far.

Yes.  She blamed her GC for the results of her own actions.

Never got an apology from anyone - but the real kicker was that when Lent ended, all my chocolate was gone.  Staples replaced it (grudgingly), but openly blamed my father for it (I honestly think she dug into it, myself, but that is absolutely a father thing to do).  

Now, as to why the European immigrant raising is important: in the area where my great grandparents moved from, southern Germany/northern Hungary/eastern Yugoslavia (literally the border changed 4 different times when my great grabdfather was in school), the orders of parents were akin to the word of god.  You didn't question it, you didn't disobey it.  Staples has constantly bitched and complained about it since I was in highschool, because she was treated that way not just by her parents, but by her aunt and grandparents as well.  One of them apologized to hwr on their deathbed, but other than that Staples' family has never acknowledged that it was a terrible way to raise children.

And Staples adopted that behavior 100%.  I wasn't given an option about my religion (was literally forced into Confirmation, which if you're Christian you know is 100% against what the sacrament is even about), I had to claim I'm doing research for writing when caught looking up Pagan/Celtic/Wiccan traditions, I've learned to hide things in my room so that Staples won't go through them - fuck, I've stopped cleaning my room because Staples and co would intentionally go through it if it was clean.  Great lesson to teach a 10 year old, right? /s

Anyway, that's my rant about Staples acting like a narc while, hilariously, not being a narc.  Because when it's anyone but her kids pointing out mistakes, she *fucking accepts it like a normal person*.",JUSTNOMIL
"DH and I told our families we were expecting (YAY!). It's the first grandchild for the ILs, so they're understandably very excited. Without consulting us, they've started to refer to themselves as ""Nana"" and ""Papa"". JNMIL bought JNFIL a mug that said ""World's best Papa"" for Father's Day, bought baby clothes that say ""I &lt;3 My Nana"" and ""I &lt;3 My Papa"", etc.

I know most people would say grandparents should choose the names they want to be called,  but in my family's language, ""papa"" is what you call your father, not grandfather. ILs and I have a very fragile relationship. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's awful. JNMIL, especially, has a tendency to take every minor criticism or comment I have and turn it into a personal attack on her. Right now with the excitement of the baby, we're on good terms and I don't want to rock the boat. But at the same time, I don't want my child calling him Papa...and I don't really want my family to be confused as to why the child is calling their grandfather ""Papa"". Am I overreacting here? Shouldn't parents have a say in what their kids call their grandparents?",JUSTNOMIL
"I've been NC with my parents since last year. I have their numbers blocked, I delete their emails unread, and I throw away their letters unread. However, on very rare occasions, I will bump into a flying monkey who will inevitable ask about my mom despite knowing full well that we no longer have a relationship. 

That happened recently. I bumped into a flying monkey at the doctor a few days ago and she told me that my mom isn't doing well. She's apparently been in and out of the hospital since January and has been there for several weeks already.

I didn't pry. I grey rocked the whole time. But my guilt has been out of control since. I *know* in my head that it shouldn't matter because NC is NC is NC but it doesn't feel that easy anymore. I am overwhelmed with guilt and the urge to go see her and check on my dad. How do I ignore these extremely powerful feelings? How do you handle NC and the feelings that come along with it when a parent is seriously ill?

Life update: I am doing pretty well! I am home again. I can walk using a walker and take stairs *very* slowly. I get PT/OT in home 2x a week. I also have not seen or heard anything from Giada in months. Maybe she thinks I moved/died or maybe she moved on. I don't care. As long as the silence continues.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi, all. Thanks so much for all your kind words and advice! Much appreciated! This is just an update on the update I posted the other day: [https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/bvy9tg/just\_another\_update\_slightly\_stressful\_but\_im\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/bvy9tg/just_another_update_slightly_stressful_but_im_not/)

I just wanted to say that all went well yesterday - I made it to my ""novicing"" with the Franciscans on time, and it was a super evening! My step-dad did actually give me a lift in the end. Mother didn't come though. I asked him, ""Is Mum upset at missing it?"" and he said, ""No, neither of us are that bothered - we're not deep thinkers like you!"" Somehow, he managed to make it sound like an insult but I did appreciate the lift so fair play, I guess.

I appreciate I probably sounded pretty paranoid in my last post - or at least, very over-anxious. It's because I'm so used to being ""toyed"" with and let down. I also have a fear of abandonment from way back. I'm addressing this in counselling and am working on not fearing the worst all the time!

I can definitely say, however, that my parents and I are not remotely on the same wavelength - my spiritual director said that my Mum and I inhabit totally different worlds and it's true - we don't actually have that much in common when it comes down to it. I guess I just need to accept that &amp; understand that it doesn't make me an ""inferior"" person. Unfortunately, mother looks down on anyone different to her so I guess subconsciously I worry that she will look down on me, as we're so different. And I don't think they take me seriously at all. But it doesn't matter - I am embarking on a new direction in which I no longer have to battle to please them - a battle I was never going to win anyway. And I'm not the same as my parents, but it doesn't mean that I'm ""less than"", whatever they may think!

Oh - Mum now has a date for her hip replacement surgery - 15th July, so not long. Her cognitive dissonance is remarkable - she's still calling herself my ""carer"" (she's got a carer's meeting next week), but she hasn't given a thought to how me, as her caree, is going to cope with her being out of action for so long! (I'm not saying I need her, but as my spiritual director pointed out, they will have asked her if anyone is reliant on her before her op so heaven knows what's she said to them!) So it's like half her brain knows she isn't my carer, but the other half still thinks she is. My SD says it's a delusion at this point. But we all know that, so there's nothing new there.

But at least I am now officially a novice, and I did appreciate step-dad giving me a lift after all.",JUSTNOMIL
"My original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/bj6vuu/nmum_showed_up_on_my_doorstep_uninvited_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), the TL;DR being that my JustNoMum showed up uninvited at my door a few weeks before my wedding, wearing the bridal hairstyle I had chosen and insisting she was going to wear her hair like that. Thanks everyone for all the advice I received on my previous post! The wedding was a couple of weeks ago, so I have an update.

At the time of the last post, I tried to speak to JustNoMum about the hairstyle and pointed out that it was the same as mine and would look odd if we matched but she brushed it off, making all sorts of excuses about it being ""similar but not the same"" and ""we have different accessories"" blah blah. For my own sanity, I dropped the subject with her and instead contacted my stylist to clear things up. Stylist told me that at her trial, JustNoMum had showed him pictures very similar to my bridal style and said I was okay with her having her hair like that. So if you guessed in the last post that she'd lied to the stylist and manipulated him into doing what she wanted, ding ding, you win points.

I sent the stylist some pictures of a different, longer style and asked if we could try that on the day instead as I didn't want the same as my mother. He agreed to come to my hotel early, to do it before any of my wedding party showed up, then JustNoMum could turn up later in the morning none the wiser and too late to sabotage anything. So on the day of the wedding, that's exactly what we did. The longer style turned out beautifully on my hair and I ended up liking it even more than the original style. When I (gleefully) opened the door to JustNoMum later, she made a minor CBF and said ""oh! You've had your hair done differently!"" I cheerfully agreed that I had and immediately motioned her into the chair for her turn, where the stylist gave her what she wanted - the original style. She didn't dare complain as she had an audience of my best man, dad, stylist's assistant and the makeup artist, and JustNoMum doesn't like having an audience to witness her bullshit. 

The rest of the day went relatively smoothly:

\- JustNoMum laced me extremely tightly into my corset-style dress - not sure if innocent mistake or a petty revenge. I had to ask Husband to loosen it before our meal as it was making me feel nauseous.

\- In the car on the way to the ceremony she started giving my dad the wrong directions to the venue, but I loudly spoke over her with the correct ones - I later heard her bitching to extended family about me ""snapping"" at her. Eyeroll.

\- Later in the evening when Husband and I had slipped off outside to watch the sunset and greet our arriving evening guests, she came to find us and started awkwardly hanging around. She'd been following us like a lost puppy for most of the reception, so Husband was having none of it and politely told her to head back inside. She actually listened and left us alone for the rest of the night.

There was some CBF that I didn't pay much attention to her and was instead dancing and chatting with my friends, but if she didn't want me to have such a strong spine, she shouldn't have laced that corset so tightly!",JUSTNOMIL

Hey guys, 
Im on mobile so I apologize for any weird formatting

So my son was born a month early, and spent 3 weeks in the NICU. He is now 8 weeks old. So I have only had him at home for 5 weeks. I did not want any visitors at the hospital and most of my family respected that. My mom wanted to be in the delivery room and I said that was okay as long as she knew if I got too overwhelmed she had to leave. She agreed to that but when it came time for me to get cervix checks I asked everyone (even my dh) to leave the room. She got angry I asked her to leave for that and told me to stop kicking her out because she was going to be in the delivery room. I just went back to focusing on myself because at that point I was in lots of pain just trying to stay calm. So she called my grandmother on the phone and started talking bad about me, right in front of me. Then got up and left. After I had the baby I held him for about 30 seconds before they rushed him away to the NICU and I was freaked out worrying about him so I called my mom and asked her to come back in the room and she told me no and hung up. She came to visit twice in the NICU, (never to visit me, only baby) and got mad because I wouldn’t let her change his first diapers or feed him. I also do not want my baby to have a social media presence until he is old enough to make that decision himself and I get crap for it every day from her “oh my friends are always asking about him but I’m not allowed to post anything” “you know none of my friends know I’m a grandma” and recently (1 week ago) I had to move back home (baby, dh, and I) to save money and I’m already going crazy. Since we moved back she comes home from work and immediately expects to take baby for the rest of the night and pouts when I won’t allow it. Every time he cries she runs in trying to take him, and doesn’t let me take care of him. She will actually tell me no if I ask for him back, or get angry and again, start pouting. She also calls him “my baby” and “my boy” which drives me UP THE WALL. I haven’t tried talking to her about it because anytime I try to she pouts or goes to my dad and says she feels unappreciated/unwanted and starts a whole bunch of bs. I understand the whole first grandchild thing but jeez it’s my first child I want to have all these memories. I don’t mind her spending time with him but it doesn’t need to be all day every day. Sorry for the jumbled thoughts but does anyone have any advice for this?

Update: How easy is it to get grandparents rights? What if both parents oppose? We are in Illinois.

Update 2: thank you guys so much. You’re all so helpful and I’ll definitely be looking into a lawyer and setting boundaries.",JUSTNOMIL
"TW: Suicide mentions.

A few days back I had a weird uneasy feeling all day long, but I couldn't place what was it. Late at night it hit me that it was probably that Spider-sense like feeling that flares up whenever one kinda feels one's narc is about to attempt to make contact and break NC, because not even moving continents can stop Narcisa (My NMom) from being annoying.

Lo and behold, 15 mins after the realization I get an email notification that Narcisa sent a mail (Her last one was around 2 months ago and went unaswered, like usual, it was the usual finger pointing, guilt-tripping and martyrdom, posted about it in JNF, can look in my post history if curious. Also I don't block her because I need to know if she threatens my dad again, they live in the same city).

So, turns out Narcisa somehow managed to apologize, or should I say, fauxpologize? Apparently she wanted to ask my brother and I for forgiveness for *'splitting up the family and only thinking of myself when I divorced your dad and abandoned you both with your dad to go live my life. Also for whatever it is that I did that hurt you'* and then stating *'I'm not doing this out of interest or because I have to, just for my peace of mind.'* (Of course the email was laced with the typical *""I don't expect an answer or forgiveness but if you don't you'll live with that in your consciousness so you do what you want""*)

Well I don't want to be that bitch, but... it's too little and too late? I half wanted to reply just to send her a long list of all the 'whatever it is she did that hurt us', but I ain't fueling that fire, summer's hot enough for me right now and don't need extra heat.

I don't know, I half expected drama on Mother's Day, but when none happened I kinda called it happening at the end of May when her sister's bday would come up, since they enable each other a lot. I probably will get another mail on Narcisa's bday in a few months too.

Last time she wrote she was saying she owed no one no explanations and trying to guilt us into contact saying she was ill and might die soon, but then again Narcisa's been almost dying for the last 6 years or so, so by now I either think Death herself avoids her ass or she has more lives than a cat. 

I been seeing lots of news articles lately about how back in my home country suicide rates have quadrupled under the dictatorship because old people with health and/or debt issues feel like a burden and turn to suicide to at least die on their own terms because food, basic goods and most meds are basically non-existant.

I'm 100% sure she's indebted up to her neck because she's a MLM queen and has a booze, lottery and meds habit, I also know she has about 1 non-MLM friend because she drives people away from her life with her shitty personality, but I don't know if she'd be considering suicide or not out of desperation due to her situation, especially now that her boyfriend dumped her.

She did bad decisions, A LOT OF THEM, and she's reaping what she sowed, like we say back at home *""Plant winds and you'll harvest storms""*.

Am I the asshole here for not wanting to resume contact/answer/forgive and not really wanting to help at all? Like I really can't wait for her to finally die and be gone so me and my brother can finally be at peace and live without fear of her reappearing or doing anything insane (she has done stuff and threatened my dad, have detailed that in previous posts).",JUSTNOMIL
"This is my first post here. I’ve know since I was in elementary school my dad is abusive and manipulative, but it wasn’t until after college that I realized and cane to accept the fact that my mother is too. It’s hard to come to terms with the fact that the one person you thought was on your side and loved you in your immediate family was actually just as self-absorbed and indifferent at best. I have a support system now, friends that are quick to point out all bullshit and offer me advice and an ear if and when I need it. Don’t really need advice, but feel free to vent with me.

My sister and I have a complicated relationship which has gotten much better since her marriage. Her husband is a just yes and I’m pretty sure he’s been working hard to undo all my parents have taught us in the way of reacting to things (like the word no). I’m still trying to keep my distance but with the birth of my nephew two years ago, we’ve been getting closer because I feel the need to protect my nephew and make sure none of what my sister and I went through growing up happens to him. He deserves better.

A couple weeks ago my sister called me and told me she’s pregnant again. My initial reaction was anxiety, as always, but I was genuinely excited for her. Apparently my parents cried. They were out to dinner with my sister and BIL (again without inviting me. No special occasion, they just wanted to see them. On the other hand, they don’t remember or care about my existence unless they want to celebrate themselves, show off their shit, or looking like good parents) so that’s what I heard. They’re flipping their shit because ANOTHER GRANDBABY! I’m careful this time to not mention any of my worries about my sister or BIL, namely, are they financially stable enough for a second child? What will they do about the house (it’s not big enough but they just bought it a year ago)? Will my sister be able to handle taking care of a toddler and an infant (they don’t trust daycares so my sister is a stay at home mom and BIL works as a contractor for a roofing company)? When I learned about my sister’s pregnancy with nephew, I worried first and voiced my concerns to my mom who got pissed I wasn’t going baby crazy with her. She tried to call my unsupportive but I just told her I was excited but my anxiety wouldn’t stop. She immediately told me she had to go and we hung up.

Anyway, a week after my sister tells me about pregnancy #2, she calls again. I had to call her back later when I got off work, and she almost let me ring to voicemail. When she answered, she sounded so emotionless and stilted. It was really obvious she didn’t want to tell me the news, and right after, she said she really didn’t want to tell me. She hated having to tell anyone. She miscarried. She had a feeling she might have the day she told me, but she was really hoping she hadn’t. She and BIL waited until she had visited the doctor to tell anyone about it, which is why she waited a week after seeing blood. She and BIL had basically spent that week hoping she hadn’t but also adjusting to the possibility, and she said she just felt numb. There wasn’t much I could do except tell her to talk to me for anything, if she needed to, then talk to AIL who had been through several miscarriages while we were growing up, ask if I could request my catholic best friend and her family could pray for her (sister is very religious and Protestant).

I called my mom later to talk about it and went from the talk about my sister to how she’s upset she can’t harden where she wants cause it’s been raining too much and all the problems with their septic tank in the span of 20 minutes. Then she texts me later to ask if my best friend’s dad will build an outdoor cabinet for my dad’s grill tools because she thinks all the ones she’s looked at are ugly and expensive. I legit had a panic attack because she asked me to talk to him about it and she stopped talking to best friend during a conversation about the table and bench set her dad built for her when best friend responded to Mom’s inquiry about getting a set of outdoor benches made by him and best friend offered to give her his phone number so they could talk prices and design. Mom asking me to talk to best friend’s dad about this is her way of weaseling a free custom made, weather treated grill cabinet for free from the dad of someone who has helped me through their bullshit so many times. She doesn’t want to pay, she has the means to contact him, she thinks it’ll be free if I’m used as a middle man. In the meantime, my sister, BIL, and I are depressed because neither of them have been through this before, my sister and I were only told about AIL’s miscarriages fifteen years after they happened (too far removed at that point to really do more than, oh no that’s terrible), and nothing like this has happened to BIL’s family (he and his twin brother are the oldest and only twin brother, one younger brother, and his oldest younger sister have had kids aside from him). Mom hasn’t even gone down to see my sister since getting the news, instead she and my dad are antiquing and looking to furnish their new house and get BIL’s help in setting up new furniture and hanging pictures.

I’m honestly so disgusted by this. My mom never left my sister’s side when she was pregnant the first time and now she’s ignoring her. My mom just retired so she’s not impeded by work obligations or anything, and my sister and BIL have a guest room she can stay in if she wants to visit and lend emotional support. NONE of that has happened.

I’m living paycheck to paycheck and can’t afford to take time off to see her. I’ve been crying off and on, dozing at night, and yelling about my parents to my best friend. I can’t make them care for my sister when she really needs it and I can’t financially care for my sister like I want to right now. I feel so fucking helpless and frustrated, but I’m going to suggest spending Fourth of July with her and BIL and nephew, and then send her videos of Jenna Marbles putting on facial prosthetics. I’m going to get paid extra for working Memorial Day, so if I get enough, I’ll spend one of my off days driving down to see her.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hello everyone. 

1st thank you all for the continued support &amp; prayers. As you can imagine I get a lot of dms &amp; comments from a lot of you &amp; it truly means a lot. The last few months I sort of stopped replying to the majority of them. Mostly cause of time, 24hrs in a day really isn't enough. The other reason is because in a sort of indirect way it brings up a lot of emotions, memories, &amp; feelings, both good &amp; bad. Its emotionally, mentally, spiritually, &amp; physically draiining. The other thing is also my lack of updates. 
New things happen daily with my love's family. They don't let up when it comes to court &amp; when it comes to interactions between us, if I had the time I could probably write an update a day. I haven't taken the time to update cause my last few have all been flagged &amp; I would have to change an adjective or 2, or because I had to move my post to another subreddit because my post wasn't just about my MIL. I hope I don't come off as blaming anyone in this amazing community, infact what helped with this update was a message I got from an admin about my particular story. 

Now for the update. I'm still in court to get my boys. I continue to get them 4 days a week. We have court on 6-11-19, next week. I've been working like crazy(drafting this on a flight right now), I've been working on myself aswell(selfcare, therapy, R&amp;R days, I got to meet 1 of my favorite DJ's). The past few months have had some big days(good, bad, &amp; difficult), it was the 1 year anniversary of my love's passing, my boy's 1st birthday, our 3rd anniversary, mothers day, my love would of gotten her master's, moving to my new apartment, promotions at work, &amp; all the milestones of our little 1's. They started to walk about 6 weeks ago, they're also vocalizing more &amp; more. 

At mediation a few months back I offered grandma loco a lot so that we can just end court, it wasn't 50/50 or anything near that but it was a lot if she was willing to agree to keep her parents away from my boys while they are with her for her time. She wanted to agree but her father (this is the asshole of the family, the bankroll, the controlling MF behind it all) wouldn't agree. They had an argument infront of the mediator &amp; when it was agreed upon that mediation failed they stormed out still fighting. He was yelling at their lawyer saying that he wants a jury trial, Texas allows for jury trial in civil cases.

Since then grandma loco &amp; I have gotten a little better. We do talk about her daughter a lot more. She's broken &amp; lost from losing her. Now I'm not dumb or naive, I know what she has done &amp; said, but I am not going to sit back &amp; watch anyone decay mentally or emotionally let alone my soulmate's mother. Even if things went down differently &amp; we had been able to be a family from the get go the trauma from losing our loved 1 would be devastating. I know her loss &amp; I know her guilt 1st hand, I know the sleepless nights, the random breakdowns, the survivor guilt, the prolonged days of no appetite, continuous hours of reliving the past to just be able to build up the strength to make it through that day, the tears that won't stop, all of it, I also know because of her actions the fear of losing my boys. The truth is I do need her for some stuff &amp; losing her forever isn't an option for me, if that's what she wants that's on her.

With all that being said, once all the court stuff is over, my boy's are my boys &amp; she's just grandma. I will raise them the best way I can with her $.02 as a guide &amp; nothing more. The rest of that family is dead to me &amp; I can't wait till I don't have to deal with them anylonger. Let the dead bury the dead Matthew 8:22, don't give pearls to swine Matthew 7:6, If anyone will not welcome you, leave that home &amp; shake the dust off your feet Matthew 10:14. I know some of my language is a little harsher than usually from me but a long time ago I leaned to pick my battles &amp; to keep quiet when needed &amp; when to speak up at the right time. My faith hasn't changed, in fact its grain stronger in my continuous walk with the Lord. 

Thank you all, God bless, love each &amp; everyone of y'all..",JUSTNOMIL
"My MIL owed my husband and I an apology for something minor about a month ago. She apologized to my husband only- and instead of apologizing to me or addressing it with me whatsoever, proceeded to completely ignore me and avoid all contact. The more time went by, the more annoyed I got about it. My husband finally admitted this behavior was totally weird and ended up asking her if she ever said anything to me about the incident, she of course played dumb saying she wasn’t sure but she would check her phone. Couple days went by and still radio silence. He ended up getting annoyed about something else she did shortly after, and the next couple days he went no contact ignoring her calls and texts saying he just didn’t feel like talking. Well, this must have tipped her over the edge because she just issued me my apology. It was written well.... had all the components of a sincere apology.... but it took her son withholding contact (and grandbaby pictures) for her to give it to me and I’m having trouble accepting.... but I also don’t want to drag this out. The only response I can muster up is “thanks, [MIL]”.... does anyone have any other ideas? This isn’t the first time she’s been a dink and my husband has forced her to apologize.",JUSTNOMIL
"Long time lurker, first time post.

To make a long story short DH and I had decided to end all contact will MIL for many a reason, but mainly because she had kicked us out of our home in the middle of the night while I was pregnant. That was over 6 years ago. In that time she has called CPS us multiple times, told police I was poisoning DH, pressed false assault charges on me, shown up unannounced, and harrassed not only us, but close friends. We have done out best not to interact with her and her tantrums. When we have confronted her about the things she has done MIL would always claim it was never her. She accused me off calling CPS on myself! Or said that I had invited her over and changed my mind to make her look bad.

Time goes on and we continue to try to ignore MIL while she tries to claw her way back in. Then over the the holiday last year she makes another unannounced visit to threaten us. If we don't talk her and let her see our child she will sue us for custody. DH laughs and tells her well see her in court because he doesn't want anything to do with her. To keep MIL from saying that I'm keeping DH from her or puppeteering him I stay quiet and out of sight. Of course that still dosen't stop her saying so.

Fast forward some and the psycho actually sues us for custody!!! Neither of us thought she was crazy enough to do so. We scrounge up all we have, sold a few things, and ask our amazing FIL for help to get a lawyer. (They've been divorced for years.)  Then we are dragged to court. Psycho MIL is put on stand to tell her sob story and finally admits to calling CPS on us everytime they have to come to our home! Sorry to leave this open ended, but the hearing was stopped and scheduled to continue at a later date. Though DH and I are confident that she has absolutely nothing on us in her case against us, aside from her 'breaking heart'. 

My question is: as I understand it, filing a false CPS report is a federal offense. Now that she has finally confessed to it, is there anything DH and I can do?",JUSTNOMIL
"On Mobile, sorry for any spelling weirdness. 

Background: I don't know if I would say my Nana is completly just no, but my Nana is very just no to my Mum at times. Mum is Nana's scapegoat when things don't go right. Some of this I witnessed myself as it happened after the wedding, some I missed and my Mom told me about it afterwards because it happened during the reception and obviously, being the bride I was not paying any sort of attention. Also, I have posted about my own mother being Just No, but now I think my Mum just might be projecting on me as I've noticed a corilation between my Mum being JustNo to me and my Nana being in a bad mood so being a bitch to my Mum. 

Other note on the wedding, JNMIL was on her best behaviour and only caused once small upset. She wanted D(ear)H and I to get up and Dance however being that it was not the venue nor the space for dancing and I'd been on my feet since 7am I did not want to dance. We firmly told MIL we would not be dancing and she dropped it. I was actually so shocked. 

On to what this is actually about. MildlyJustNoNana, Mum, and my wedding. 

I am Mum's only daugher, and Mum is Nana's only daughter. My Mum is 42, I am 21 and neither of us have any experience planning a wedding what so ever. Mum was not alowed to help plan her own wedding as my Nana and my Nana's Sister took over and planned the whole thing. I am also 4.5 months pregnant and my Husband and I had planned to elope quietly until my Nana said no and gave us about 1/3 of the money needed for the wedding. 

Planning the wedding went pretty smoothly, except that my Nana hated the venue we had chosen because it was a Brewery and the whole Reception was only to be three hours. My Mum tried to explain to her that with only three months to plan a wedding and a budget of about $5000 this was what we could do. It was like we had reserved seats for 60 at a resturaunt but this resturaunt happened to be a brewery and that it was so short because they had another wedding coming in at 5:00pm and also given my mild social anxiety, and dislike of being the center of attention a 2h photo time, 1/2h ceremony and 3h reception was about as good as I could do without getting overwhelmed and crying (my Mom knows me too well). My Mom reassured my Nana that the venue looked very nice and that brewerys arn't trashy and told her to just drop it. 


Day of the wedding everything was going very very smoothly. My Mum, Dad and Brothers where 1/2 an hour late to photos, but that's just what happens when you are trying to get 3 stubborn little boys ready for somthing where they have to look well and be on their best behavior. It wasn't a big deal because everyone else was on time and we just started with the photos with Grandparents, Wedding Party and Grooms Side instead and left the photos with my Family to the end. All the photos got done and we even had time to spare before the ceremony. Of course though because my Mum was once again late (my Mom is kinda known within the family for being late to everything) my Nana yelled at her quite viciously for being late and made Mum cry with her yelling. My Dad stepped in and defused the situation saying that today isn't about my Mom or my Nana or who is late, today is about the bride and the groom and that Mum and Fam didn't miss the photos, the photographer was not rushed and that Bride (me) had expected and planned for them to be about 1/2 an hour late. 


At the ceremony we had one small hiccup in that I could not get my husbands ring over his weird knobby knuckle. The officiant laughed about it and let my husband just put it on himself because it would go on, but with dificulty. Nana of course bitched to Mum ""didn't they get their rings sized properly"" ""why did DH's get stuck?"" Nana also did not like our rings going on about why didn't we just buy simple silver or gold bands. Our rings are tungsten titanium cut and heated in a special process so that they reflect diffrent colours depending on the light. We had them made to reflect the colours of aroura borialis as we like to go up north on our vacations and we thought it was prettier then simply having silver bands. Nana insisted the ""fancy"" bands where a waste of money when we where on such tight budget for the wedding. *eyeroll* we like them.  Also on rings, I can no longer wear my engagement ring because my fingers are very short and the two rings together come up to my first knuckle, so it's uncomfortable. We plan to have my engagement ring re-sized at some point so that I can wear it on my other hand, but right now it's not a priority and given that I'm pregnent and its summer my fingers are quite swolen so resizing it now doesn't really make sence. Nana is insisting that I'm waisting DH money by not wearing my engagment ring anymore. DH understands why I'm not wearing it but as a couple we have prioritised buying me new eyeglasses over having my engagement ring resized. 


The reception went almost completely without issue until we got to dessert. Now, this is the part that I completely missed because I was off greeting guests and chatting with friends, but my Mom went to approach the staff of the brewery about pulling out the pies from the fridge. When Nana saw Mom coming with the pies she said ""what's with the pies? Where is the cake?"" Mum explained that DH and I don't like cake and wanted pie instead. So we went and bought pie. Mum asked for help from Nana cutting the pies and putting each slice on a plate and that each pie should be 8 slices to ensure we have enough for everyone there. Well Nana and Nana's Sister started bitching at my Mom up and down that 8 slices made the slices too small and we were being cheap and we should make the pies 6 slices. Mum put her foot down and said ""No. When we bought the pies we calculated the amount of pie we would need based on 8 slices. If we cut six slices there won't be enough pie for everyone. All this math has already been done and calculated. "" fine. Instert CBF from Nana and her sister but Mum got her way.  As predicted we had enough pie.  Only 2 slices of pumpkin left.  Nana insists we should have bought 4 chocolate pies insted of 2 which Mum agrees with but oh well, we can't go back and change that now. 


After the reception we (my husband and I) went back to our apartment to get changed and have a nap. About two hours later we went over to my parents house because I needed some help getting my every day endless hoop earings back in (I have 3 piercings and 2/3 I never change. My Mom put in the hoops on those as soon as I didn't need the bars anymore and my wedding was the first time i removed the hoops). My Nana was over at my parents house as well as her and Grandpa were staying in town over night.  We all got on the conversation topic of the cottage and, as I'm doing up my Baby regestry and I know my mom sent a lot of her larger baby items like the pack and play and high chair to the cottage after my brothers outgrew them to be used by my cousins I asked if they where still there or if DH and I should plan to lug things up to the cottage next summer when LO is 6mo.  Well apparently Nana threw all that away and Mom is pissed. The high chair that was up there was very nice and the pack and play was useful for sleeping babies and also for bringing to the lake and sitting on the deck to contain babies from crawling into the lake. Nana insisted they where taking up too much space in the basment of the cottage and mum called BS on that. The basment is completely unused because its unfinished and the things where just tucked in a quiet corner. Nana suggested instead we buy a clip on high chair that folds up for the cottage but those are expensive and with 10-15 people, 2 large dogs and everything else running around my Mom doesn't trust them. They don't seem sturdy to her when compaired to the old high chair that was there. Mom ended up dropping the subject, but 3 days later she is still butthurt that Nana threw away the baby things that Mom brought up to be used by any visiting children. 

Finally, and we are getting to the end of this wedding adventure, the day after our wedding DH and I just really needed to catch up on laundry and housework. Some of our laundry always gets done at my Mom's like delicates and sheets because either we only have a 1/2 load or they are nicer dried on the clothes line. Typically we drop our laundry off in the morning and my Mom does it and we pick it up after supper. Well on Sunday when we went over to pick it up my parents were not home. My brothers said they went to get milk and told me where the laundry was. As I was heading out the phone rang and I looked at the caller ID saw it was my Nana and decided to pick it up. She just wanted to say her and grandpa got home safe and so I left a note for my Mom and we left. Well yesterday my Nana called my Mom and bitched that she didn't get why I was always over at my parents and don't i have my own life and my own stuff to do at my own place. I live 20 minutes walk away from my parents. A person can only clean a 2 bedroom apartment and talk to their cats so long (I don't have a job but my Husband works long hours so I get lonely).  That's why I'm over at Mum's a lot. 


Hopefully this wasn't too long. Thank you everyone for reading about my Nana's WTFness.  Any advice you have for dealing with her arguments and bitchyness is appreciated.",JUSTNOMIL
"I’ve been bottling this all up, but now that I’m sitting at my desk bawling my eyes out, I need to get it off my chest.  This is going to be long and rambly and I apologize in advance if it makes little sense because I’m kind of a mess. 

My grandmother was a JustNo. Treated my mom horribly, my mom left home at 16 and didn’t look back. She barely had anything to do with me before she died. You’d think an upbringing like that would show you how NOT to treat your kid. 

My mother has always been a narc. Nothing new. I’m the only daughter and my whole life has been either not perfect enough for her, or competition. When I was younger she would screech at me if I weren’t in a dress with hair and makeup completely done for church, because it would look bad on her. As I got older, it was I couldn’t be skinnier, or prettier, or more knowledgeable about things. If people ask me questions (related to my job field) and she is around me, she will literally talk over me or say the opposite of me because she needs to be right. 

She’s always on me for what a horrible excuse of a woman I am because unlike her, I don’t dress like a nun clutching my pearls. (Id like to say I dress just like any other normal 30 something woman? But this is also the woman who called me a whore for wearing shorts when it was 100 degrees out lol) 

Anyways, my younger brother is seeing someone. One of my dads students. He essentially introduced them, and has said nothing but how sweet she is. I checked out her Instagram and she seems like a very normal, early 20s girl. She’s very pretty, and very blonde. (Important because my mother HATES blondes) 

I hear her going off about “that disgusting blonde slut” and I couldn’t roll my eyes any harder. She was also accusing my dad of trying to hook up with this girl because she’s such a whore (keep in mind has never met her and has only seen her Instagram) 

I stupidly interject and tell her to cut it out. She looks like a sweet girl and she should be happy her son is happy. She looks like a normal girl her age and her posts are no different from any other girl, hell she and I have a lot of similar posts. 

She turns and looks me square in the eyes. “My point exactly. You’re a slut and an embarrassment. Everyone talks about how much of a whore you look like online. You’re disgusting. It’s only a matter of time before SO gets sick of using you and leaves you just like the rest.” 

Now as you know, relationship wise I’ve been pretty traumatized. Dating has not been easy for me, and I’ve had my heart broken once since things ended with exFH. I FINALLY found a good man, who’s amazing, treats me wonderfully, gets my anxiety, and the biggest thing of all, I have not been anxious about our relationship since day 1. I feel such a comfort I’ve never felt before. Except now I’m obviously a wreck wondering if she’s right. 

I didn’t answer her so she kept going, saying how I was every mother’s worst nightmare. Every mother wants a wholesome girl next door, not a slut like me. I finally snapped and told her she was no different than peepad. She literally raged and started screaming every curse in the book at me and throwing things and “fucking how dare you.” But then turned around and said “I don’t blame peepad, I wouldn’t want a girl like you anywhere. “ 

I’ve grown very used to ignoring her crap. But she hit me where it hurts with my new relationship and now I’m curled up into a ball just wanting to die. 

Thank you for giving me a safe space to just get it out.",JUSTNOMIL
"I flaired this advice wanted but I don’t know what advice could be given so I guess I’m mainly just venting.

I’ve gotta give a little back story to explain how she’s screwed me up this time.

My sons father hasn’t been a part of his life since he was three.  Barely paid child support.  Well he’s currently over  thirty thousand behind.  Last year he was arrested on a bench warrant for failure to appear.  Had to pay a bond of over a thousand bla bla bla.  Well the court has been holding it since.  The state is now petitioning the court to have the funds released to me.

A while back I posted that Bitcho was being nice to me and that she was telling me she’d pay for me to get there and a room.  When will I ever learn because I should have known it was all bull shit.  A friend told me I could stay with them which meant I would only need gas to get down there and back and then food for the time and parking for when I go to court.  Well now she says she won’t give it to me because she’s gotta have her diet cokes and butterscotch’s.  So yeah, she tells me this last night knowing I have to leave tomorrow.

So because I can’t make it now I risk them issuing a bench warrant for me, possibly dismissing the bond and releasing it back to him, and possibly wiping out all his back support.  I’ve already called, they can’t reschedule it so they said.  That bond money would help buy clothes that my son desperately needs.

I’m just, can I give up now?

Edit:  I guess I worded something wrong, my issue wasn’t a place to stay, a friend has offered me to stay with her.  The issue was getting there from four hours away.  But that issue has now been resolved as well so thank you to everyone who offered advice.",JUSTNOMIL
"Back again with the MiL, small rant, advice always welcome!

If you’ve read my past posts, you’ll see that MiL has a habit of blowing up DH’s phone whenever she wants to talk. This could be when he is spending time with me, or when he’s at work. Either way, it’s not just one text at a time, it’s multiple complaining about her life and what’s going on with her. 

Over the past few days, DH and I have been at odds over a few things regarding his mother and his behavior. I posted to r/JUSTNOSO and didn’t get much from that, but a little bit from that post is this: DH often says he doesn’t want to talk to her, especially when she is texting or calling him while I’m around. He refuses to answer any calls, which is what I thought was him honest to goodness ignoring her because he doesn’t want to talk to her. Turns out, I was wrong. 

MiL and DH talk almost every night over the phone, calls and texts constantly. All of which is when I’m not around, because he works third shift. When I ask about what they were discussing, just curious because I want to make sure he isn’t talking about my pregnancy, he sugarcoats everything they discuss or says he forgets. I know this isn’t the case, because he mentions how everything they talk about is in the texts messages as well. (I don’t go through his phone usually, it was by accident I even found out they were still talking so often.) 

MiL has always had a habit of talking to him when I’m not around, and DH goes along with it. She would often get up early in the morning, when he was getting home from work, to talk to him when I was asleep. She would take him into other rooms to talk so I couldn’t hear what was being said, or text him at night when he would be at work. All this when we lived with her. 

Now that we have moved away, I figured things would start to get better, as MiL should be busy finding a damn job instead of blowing up her son’s phone. She still feels the need to be so wrapped up in DH’s life, that it’s starting to affect my marriage YET AGAIN! 

When we lived with MiL before getting married, things were okay. She and I didn’t get along all the time, but we never fought (like yelling and screaming). When we were finally married, MiL’s behavior changed drastically. This is when she started to throw more fits, would cry constantly saying how she didn’t feel apart of the family, and just overall treated me horribly. 

One example in particular is when she started to smoke in the house again, after we made clear when she moved back with us it was not allowed, and threw a fit saying it didn’t feel like her home because she couldn’t smoke. When DH and I finally got pregnant, I mentioned again how she was not allowed to smoke in the house, to which she started it up again. The amount of disrespect she has shown towards me over the few years I’ve known her is outrageous! 

Because of all that happened between me and MiL, my marriage has been affected in such a horrible way in less than a year of marriage. DH and I agreed we needed to work on our marriage to try and fix all the spots MiL intervened and ruined for us. But she still hasn’t stopped! I’m not sure she ever will at this point. Oh, and might I mention, she texts him, and he calls her, specifically when he is supposed to be at work. So, it’s not like she doesn’t know I’m not around at that point. 

I’m honestly concerned about my marriage, and the fact that it can still damaged more and more by MiL, even when she isn’t living with us. I don’t even have contact with her anymore, I went NC when I moved back to my mothers before finding our house. But yet, she is still affecting the trust I have in DH, pressuring him by texting and calling so often, and keeping it all from me. I’ve caught him in lies (i.e I mentioned how he calls her, which is clear from the call list, but he tried to say she is the one calling him) and how he doesn’t talk to her but once every couple of weeks. Again, obviously not true by all the calls made, received and texts exchanged. 

DH and I can’t afford to see a counselor right now due to being tight on money and a little one on the way. Trying to rebuild what was messed up by MiL now seems impossible. Ugh, why MiL?!",JUSTNOMIL
"This is my first post here and I'm new to this sub so I don't know all of the rules or lingo but I'll try my best and I apologize in advance if I screw up.

Background:
I have been with my fiancee for 2 1/2 years. We're living at his parents lake house while we save up for our own place and our wedding. His parents don't live with us but they and his sister both have rooms at the lake house. The first year I had lived there his parents had stayed with us for the summer and in the beginning I got along rather well with his mother despite being shy and guarded due to my own past trauma at my parents hands mainly my mother (its way too long to get into here but I will post a link to my sister's justnomom post at the bottom)

The problems first started when FSIL would stay with us for weeks at a time. She never lifted a finger to help around the house though she didn't mind making a mess and would often make belittling ""jokes"" about me. (My weight, the fact that I was quiet and whenever I would say something simple such as ""I'm getting a glass of water"" she would snap back with ""you're not allowed"") 

It made me feel very unwelcome but not being a confrontational person I didn't say anything. Apparently I dont control my facial expressions as well and FMIL saw my displeasure and has been hostile to me ever since. 

Last spring I snapped at FSIL after she made a comment calling me autistic (I told her it was unacceptable) and or course momma bear rose to her defense and berated me for it. FH and I left soon after. 

The next day FH went and talked with his mother about me and she told him that me being so quiet and rarely speaking up made her feel like I didn't want to be part of the family and that when I did speak I had a tone of voice that made her believe that I thought I was better than them (???) 

I didn't want to go back but FH was convinced that being around them would help them get to know me better so I reluctantly agreed to continue with FMIL's mandatory Sunday dinners (Any attempts to not attend by FH and I was met with constant bitching that we we're interrupting her family time and that I was pulling FH away from her)

The only thing that had changed was that we had texted FSIL and asked her to stop with the jokes as I found them hurtful and she had agreed. FMIL was still cold towards me. I told FH this but he didn't see it and swore things we're getting better.

Everything came to a head last Sunday. FMIL was saying she was worried about a trip to the beach we had planned with the family because of the tension with FSIL. (There hasn't been tension since the texts) FH told her there was no tension but FMIL said she knew we texted FSIL but didnt know what was said just that it had hurt FSIL. 

FMIL insinuated that the tension was caused by me and was bitching about me to FH like I wasn't sitting right beside him. I snapped at her and told her if she had something to say to me I was right there. She starts going off saying that should couldn't do that because I don't talk. (I talk when I have something to say) 

FH tired to explain that I was quiet due to my past and FMIL yelled that she was tired of hearing that and it was in the past and I need to get over it. She also chastised me like I was a child for ""giving her dirty looks"". I grabbed my dog and left to sit in my car while FH talked with her. FFIL came and talked me through a panic attack during this. 

During his talk FH learned that a friend of FMIL overheard my sister and I venting about our MIL's to our hairdresser and went back to her about it. 

I told FH that I want nothing to do with them until FMIL apologises (fat chance of that) and he agreed. 

FH is distraught about this whole thing because he loves his parents and for all intents and purposes they're good parents just not accepting of any of his past relationships. 

I'm just worried about what's going to happen after (if) we get an apology. I fear things will just go back to the way they are. 

FH just wants his family to be happy, which includes me and FMIL and I just dont want to have to fight everyday to be treated like a human being with feelings.

And please dont judge FH too harshly. Hes a very good man in a very difficult situation and is doing the best he can.

"So in my last post I described going NC with my JNmom after she insisted on coming for months long visits every year for years and refused to accept that I was finally establishing boundaries. 
After a few weeks of NC I couldn't take the anxiety any more and re established VVLC. This anxiety was due to constant stress that she would do something crazy if I remained NC, namely go for GPR. She is insanely entitled. Wouldn't have much of a case, she lives on the other side of the country so doesn't see my 3 year old daughter regularly but I literally couldn't stop panicking about it. Easier to just let her visit for 4 days. Also my daughter wants to see her. I don't know if this is the right choice but I am sticking with it for now. Also during NC she had FMs calling, which is  stressful. I hate that even when a number is blocked they can still leave a voicemail. Anyway.
She still came out for her 6 week visit but I firmly established that she cannot see us until the final 4 days. That starts Friday. She's been staying with various friends and relatives till then. Well, she was supposed to but texted me last weekend asking if I could find her a hotel room in my city early because she was no longer getting along with the cousin she was staying with (what a surprise). I said no, I literally don't even have time to sleep right now (husband and I both work full time in different cities). And don't come to our city early, we CAN'T SEE YOU UNTIL FRIDAY. She of course booked a hotel down the street anyway. If she shows up before Friday she will not be let in. So she's been at the hotel since yesterday and it's pissing me off. It feels like she is hovering invisibly. She keeps texting saying she's eating a restaurant down the street etc. I am not responding really and when I do it's nothing but grey rocking. She must really want a reaction because this morning she texted me ""just remember that today is the anniversary of your father's death. Always remember June 4th."" Ok....maybe a bit overdramatic? Yeah, I hadn't forgotten that he was dead. She constantly is sentimental about dates and the like to get attention, she really makes other people's deaths about her. Never mind that my parents had been divorced for over a decade when my dad died and they were not close. I feel like she is circling. I am not going to cancel the visit but I could use some advice on how to get through it. Sorry for any formatting issues and TIA.",JUSTNOMIL
"I almost feel bad about posting because, as previously stated, Dolostrich isn't nearly as bad as the majority of JNMILs I read about here. I think she straddles the line between here and r/raisedbynarcissists, while occasionally exhibiting some JustYes behavior. She's an odd duck.

That said, I've found posting to be kind of cathartic, so I'll keep it up from time to time.

In Dolostrich's mind, an accusation is the same as proof. If she thinks you've done something, you've done it and no amount of explanation or evidence will change her mind.

A while back, we had gathered at her and FIL's house for dinner, as SIL had recently returned from a weeklong camping trip with her church youth group. Fun, apparently, had been had by all. Before dinner, she and Wife had been talking about the trip and SIL had recounted an amusing anecdote.

Fast forward to dinnertime, and Dolostrich was saying the prayer. She expressed thanks that SIL had returned safely from camp. This was enough of a reminder of SIL's funny story that Wife and SIL smiled during the prayer. That was it, just a smile.

Dolostrich ended the prayer and immediately started yelling that she didn't deserve to be made fun of and it was really rude of wife and SIL to laugh at her. She then stood up and stalked to her bedroom, slamming the door. Wife, SIL, and FIL all tried to explain about the funny story, but Dolostrich wouldn't back down. She declared that until she got an apology from both SIL and Wife, then she wouldn't talk to them.

This wasn't too bad for Wife and I as we hadn't yet had to move in. SIL, on the other hand was a teenager and still living at home. Dolostrich was true to her word and pretended SIL didn't exist for three days. She wouldn't talk to her or acknowledge her existence in any way. SIL broke down and apologized. Dolostrich berated her again for making fun of her and ended the silent treatment. 

Wife lasted about a week before giving a half apology at SIL's request. Apparently, Dolostrich was still being salty to her and FIL because she hadn't heard from Wife. Wife did it to help out SIL and FIL.

Having gotten what she wanted, Dolostrich graciously allowed herself to interact with us again.",JUSTNOMIL
"I'm in my late 20s and my mother is the one who doesn't want me to move out but most of all, she doesn't want me to take it  a step further with my SO. We are in a serious relationship and would be taking the next steps but only if I finally managed to move out for good. I'm grateful for my bf's patience because we've been together for 4 years now and he has accepted my family situation up to a point. 

It's been rough sometimes because of this point of contention (my mother and how I respond to her) and I'm worried how this might turn out and what I could do to finally take the steps I want to take. 

Why don't I just move out? I'm not in a financially stable position at the moment. I'm studying as well as working (several jobs) and if I'd move in with my bf, I would probably find another job without much problems. 

However, I just feel a lot of guilt, a sense of obligation that's difficult to shake. Maybe I just have to accept those feelings but it's hard. 

First, my mother refuses to know anything about my SO, she refuses to get to know him, she disparages him without knowing anything about him and wants me to break up with him, says my life is going to be miserable if I stay with him  (her reason: him not being white). My SO wants to get to know her and can't believe she would behave as bad as I say she would. I've seen my mother react to other relatives' fiancées and it has always been a nightmare of disrespect and humiliation. Nobody is ever good enough for her. 

Second, my mother guilt trips me all the time. If I ever want anything for me, normal adult things like setting boundaries, moving out, getting a job, not having to do chores at a moment's notice, I'm called selfish, bad and ungrateful. Like I'm the worst child she could have. When in fact I have done everything to be a model child to her and cause as little problems as possible.

Third, she's not always that bad. Sometimes she seems to be love-bombing me and want to buy me gifts. But then again, she sees this as a sacrifice and that I owe her. I have refused her help and gifts in the last years, gradually.

I know she is not physically restraining me from moving out (and taking other important steps in life), but psychologically she is, and I just want to know from others who have had similar experiences? How did you manage to do it? How did you cope with the guilt? Where you prepared for the psychological part of this? 

Also: Could you manage to present your SO to your mother? How?

"Obligatory LTL FTP, on mobile so apologies for formatting issues.

Okay so back story! I have a 2yr old Son with my GF and we're expecting another baby in January so it's early day. My monster of a mother (MM) has been a classic JN my whole life, manipulating people, overstretching the truth and just generally twisting things so she's the victim. Also MM is severely sight impaired but is very well adapted to this and is usually very good with Son.

That brings us to recently, Son had to go to hospital on a Sunday because he had a seizure. We kept him off nursery on the Monday so he could relax after having spent almost 18 hours in the hospital. On Monday evenings my parents usually pick him up from nursery and keep him until Tuesday, I wasn't sure about letting this happen because of said seizure. MM called on Monday to check in and I mentioned maybe not sending Son to them that evening, she immediately took offence and started reeling off relatives that have epilepsy and how she is confident dealing with seizures etc. So I discussed it with GF and we agreed to let MM have Son overnight provided she followed some instructions, if he had a clinic seizure to immediately call an ambulance but if it was an absent seizure to call us when it happens so we can take him back to the ward where he had been treated previously, we told he this over the phone and confirmed it when we dropped him off that evening.

Tuesday evening rolls around and having heard nothing through the day I assume all is fine, WRONG! They arrive at my place and as I am getting Son ready for bed as he looks exhausted she casually informs me that he may have had an absent seizure whilst at a play group and fell to the ground, not moving for minutes. I freak out and ask her why she didn't call and she said she didn't think she needed to, this makes me see red but as I have a strict, no fighting in front of Son policy I told her that he needed to go to bed so she needed to leave. I didn't take Son to hospital that day because he was shattered but I took him at 6am the next morning.

Flash forward to the weekend, GF collapsed at work and had to be taken to hospital by ambulance, obviously I'm worried and want to be with her but don't want to take Son to hospital so I call MM and ask if they can watch Son for a while, maybe overnight depending on how GF is. This is where things get fun, she immediately starts laying into me about how I am Son's mother and he should be my priority not GF (the mother of my unborn child) and that I'm irresponsible and reckless and just generally attacking my ability to be a mother. This completely sets me off and I rip into her shouting about how she has no right to call me irresponsible when I trusted her to care for Son and he had a seizure and she didn't call me when she should have and that I clearly couldn't trust her etc, I also brought up other examples of her being a JN such as actively defying my parenting choices (refusing to take the side of his cot at their house even though he sleeps in a bed at ours, refusing to stop feeding him junk food, refusing to stop giving him a baby bottle and the worst one if refusing to be consistent in our efforts to potty train because it's ""inconvenient""). This was just the straw that broke the camel's back. She then tried to twist it back on me saying I shouldn't have left Son with a blind woman and that was reckless, I'm a bad mother etc etc etc and then lots of other generic yelling and name calling, it's been 30 minutes at this point and I am done so I tell at her to get lost and hang up. I then screen MM and my father's calls all day and even Dad sends me some pretty awful messages saying things you just shouldn't say to your child so I decide to turn my phone off and take a day to collect myself. 

The next day I talk to my brother who informs me MM has shredded all the photos she has of me and effectively disowns me, that cut deep so immediately I decide that's it, NC, block them on every platform I can think of and attempt to get over it. 
A week later she tries to message me acting like nothing happened (as always). I continue NC. 

I then start getting the emotional voicemails and texts with the occasional insult thrown in. The icing on the cake is them getting my Grandad who I love more than anything to call me (obviously having told him a spun and heavily redacted version of events) and tell me it's not fair to keep them out of mine and Son's life, guilting me into doubting myself. I pull myself together and get even more angry about how low they stooped.

It's now been 3 weeks NC and a few days ago my brother sends me a SS of MM's latest FB post. Which reads as a eulogy for my son, over the next few days I spent my time fielding calls from family worried that something had happened to Son. 

I'm so angry at MM and want her to stop this harrasment but absolutely don't want to open up communication for her to worm her way back in.",JUSTNOMIL
"I've posted before about my MIL but her JustNo behavior is far enough apart that I'm not a regular poster. See my flair for a super brief description of her. She's a wonderful babysitter for our kid, and overall she's great, but both DH and I are getting sick of her trying to control things. Just last week she guilt-tripped me into going to a birthday party for her sister that I really didn't want to go to but MIL was soooooo pushy about it I finally relented. Like I said I was too busy but then happened to mention that I'd taken my kid to the library that afternoon and she was like ""oh well looks like you're actually not that busy after all, so you should definitely go to the party!"" God dammit, now I have to. (I know I didn't really have to but...dammit I did.) My mom would never do that. She'd say ""there's a party for X family member, feel free to come but if you can't it's totally fine"" and never bring it up again. 

But anyway, on to today's story. My grandma died a few days ago so my siblings and I are traveling back to our home state for the funeral. It just so happens that one of MIL's siblings now lives in the small town where the burial will be (different place than the city where the actual funeral that morning will be). MIL said I should go visit Aunt while I'm in town. I said I really won't have time, it'll be a busy day and we're just driving over to that town really fast for the burial and then driving back to the main city again. She kept pushing, even saying she could have Aunt come to the cemetery to say hi! 

Um. Wut.

First off, that's creepy as hell to meet up at a cemetery.
Secondly, again, I won't have time.
Third, I'll be carpooling with my siblings so I can't waste their time seeing someone they don't even know. 
Fourth, I'M GOING TO A GODDAMN FUNERAL. FOR MY GRANDMA. THIS IS *MY* FUCKING FAMILY. Who I never see because I'm in a different state. Ugh it made me so mad. 

I ended up just saying that there's no way I'll have time so no I can't meet up with Aunt. But I just know that she'll go ahead and message her anyway to tell her I'll be in town but am not stopping by to say hi. And then I'll look like the bad guy.

My husband, bless him forever, agrees that his mom is way out of line trying to get me to do stuff with her family while I'm with mine. He asked if I want him to talk to MIL about it. I said no, I think I made it clear enough that I will absolutely not be visiting her sister during my brief funeral trip, but that if she brings it up again I would absolutely like him to step in. Let me know if y'all agree with that plan or if you think he should talk to her about it now. 

(Side note: I did end up messaging Aunt to let her know I'll be in town but won't have any time to stop by since I'll be busy with funeral stuff with my family, and that I'm sorry I'll be so close but can't see them. Just so they know about my trip from me rather than from MIL.)",JUSTNOMIL
"MIL called last night wanting to know if the family would be going to DH’s cousin’s baby shower in August.

Normally we would, but I’ll be 8 months pregnant, with an almost 2 year old and, oh yeah, it’s over 4 hours away.

She wanted us to share a hotel room with her too, and then have dinner with SIL while there.

Normally I would make the trip, but I’m not driving that far, that pregnant. On top of that, I’m super annoyed because she made a fit about driving 2 hours to our cabin for our gender reveal. 

Apparently she also told my mom, after seeing the pink glitter fly, “well... i guess EpicOwl got what she wanted, another girl.” My mom looked at her and flat out said “well it’s not like she had a choice... be happy we’re getting another heathy grandbaby.” MIL shut up.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hello everyone! I haven't had to post in a while. Navy Saylor has been pretty decent recently, a few BEC moments but nothing overtly just no. But last night she slipped back into old habits. 

&amp;#x200B;

To set the scene: I am pregnant but not pregnant. We are doing IVF and had a transfer 3 days ago. There IS an embryo inside of me, but we do not know if it stuck or not and will not find out for another week. At any rate, we are DEFINITELY not to the announcing to the public stage yet. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday we went to a wedding, my husband and BIL were groomsmen and my FIL was the officiant, we are VERY close to this couple and see them often. I was helping a little during cocktail because I knew where a lot of stuff was supposed to go and the workers were running behind. But I couldn't figure out where this one specific thing was supposed to go, I knew my MIL would know though so I went to ask her. She was standing at the bar talking to the SIL of the groom (and bride now too I guess), there were about 30 other guests in the general vicinity as that was the bar and where the apps were. So I go up to her and got there at just the wrong time... when she was ordering her drink. She says (louder than needed) to the bartender ""I'll have the red wine, \[spermbanks\] wont be having anything though because she's pregnant!"" 

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty much everyone in the area looked at me and started congratulating me, etc. I was super uncomfortable the whole time and this went on the rest of the night with random people coming up congratulating me and my husband. I felt SO bad for the bride and groom because its their day, they deserve to be 100% of the focus. I could tell they were upset so I went to talk to them about it and explained what happened and that I was sorry, they accepted my apology but its also easy to tell there was still some tension. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so annoyed right now and I don't know what to do. It wasn't her place to announce ANYTHING, especially when I'm not even officially pregnant, DEFINITELY not at a wedding because its very rude and hurt our relationship with the bride/groom.

Edit to add: us doing IVF isn’t a secret, we post about it often and even made a post on Friday about our transfer, so many guest knew we were possibly pregnant. I just find the fact that she grossly over exaggerated where we are in it at a wedding really awful. Especially since many don’t understand IVF and assumed I did know I was pregnant.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hello,

I’ve not been around so much- not because my mother has been behaving well but because I was really trying to get therapy to work things out.

She came to visit around 8 months ago.

She brought a terrible fiction book on abusive relationships as she believes my FDH is emotionally manipulating me into me telling her boundaries etc.

She complained in detail about my Father - “if he was dead, all my troubles would be gone....joking!” And “your father is the reason you still owe us money, I would clear the debt”, “your father uses his chronic illness to manipulate the situation” - I don’t disagree with all of this but...that’s my Dad? Why are you telling me this?

I told her I was bisexual and she’s still coming to terms with it. Not that I need her to. I don’t care. However, I do care she said “any mother would be disappointed to hear her daughter is gay”.

Honestly the list goes on and after telling her I don’t want to visit due in part to the above stuff she is telling me once again to let it go.

How am I suppose to let stuff go when she always says “you’ve thrown a lot at us over the years” (clearly not letting it go) and never apologising, never accepting accountability and plain rug sweeping? 

What the hell do I do now? I feel like I’ve picked a hill to die on and I can’t bring myself to let it go - is this my fault? Tell me if it is!",JUSTNOMIL
"TW: drug addiction

(using ex-FMIL and ex-FFIL because my FH died)

&amp;#x200B;

My ex-FMIL has made it very clear that she is a narcissist through and through. My FH died suddenly a month ago after relapsing on heroin after 5 years clean. Without getting into too many details - before this, I was not aware that he had an issue with heroin, only that he had a history of drug problems. As such, this has been a huge shock on so many levels - not even counting how my roommate and I found him overdosed twice in a week, before he died a few days later died in detox.

&amp;#x200B;

Before his death, I had a good relationship with ex-FMIL but my FH warned me that she was a JustNo and was VLC with his mother and her partner. She is VERY JustNo, and borderline Jocasta (said at his funeral ""in his next life, I want FH to come back as my husband"", RIGHT in front of me). On the other hand, ex-FFIL and his wife are great people who I love deeply and are used to dealing with ex-FMIL.

&amp;#x200B;

My and my FH live(d) on the west coast, my FH's family lives on the east coast. I flew to the east coast for the funeral, and spending time with ex-FMIL was good until ex-FMIL demanded I give her my FH's phone and the passcode to it when I was there. He was 36...and he did not want his mother to have access to his phone, which I knew before he died. She threw a fit because it was ""her right as a mother"" to have his passcode. I tried to leave with the phone, her partner chased me down 4 flights of stairs and forcefully held me until ex-FMIL could get downstairs to berate me more. So, I gave the phone and left.

&amp;#x200B;

The drama has not ended there. Since then, I've gotten nothing but demands. Demands to bring his art to the memorial his work is having for him this week, demands to pick up medical records (because me and my roommate are the only ones he authorized to get his records when he checked into detox, ha!), demands for passcodes and passwords, etc. When I haven't answered her texts, she will blow up my phone saying terrible thing to me to try and get me to reply. When I block her, she communicates in another way or through her FM. Despite telling her that I will respond to her within a day or two, as I'm working through my own grief and trauma, she is unable to respect any of these boundaries. Because of this bombardment of communication, I blocked her on everything except email and am mainly communicating with her partner.

&amp;#x200B;

My FH was a minimalist. When he moved into our house he moved all of his stuff in his small sedan. He has clothes, a computer, a few pieces of art (as he was an artist), some kitchen items, and a few other miscellaneous personal effects. She's demanded that I give her everything - despite the fact that her and ex-FFIL each have storage units full of his stuff and art from 2 other stints in rehab. I HAVE HARDLY ANYTHING OF HIS, minus his tee shirts and 4 pieces of art - but yet she feels entitled to all of it because he's her BABY and I was only his fiancee. I AM THE MOST COMPASSIONATE PERSON I KNOW, I WOULD GLADY GIVE HER ANYTHING IF SHE HAD JUST ASKED AND HADN'T JUST DEMANDED EVERYTHING. Same thing with grieving, I may be grieving and experiencing trauma but it's NOT AS BAD AS HERS. Obviously, ex-FFIL is empathetic, not trying to take everything I have of his, and is helping me, but the stress that ex-FMIL is putting me through in unbearable.

&amp;#x200B;

Which leads to today's issue. Since she's coming into town this week for the memorial service at his work, she wants to tour our house when she's in town (she didn't get to see it before he died, as he had only lived here for 6 months and she hadn't had time to visit) to see where he lived before he died and take all of this things (and, of course, rummage through our house and take anything she thinks is his). After everything that occurred, I did not feel comfortable with her and her partner just showing up BUT I didn't want to deny his mother and partner the chance to see his home. I don't like her, but I'm not cruel and I know I'd want the same grace (despite all of her boundary stomping). As a result, I sent a nice email laying out clear boundaries. I 1) gave a half hour window where she could visit, 2) told her that I would box up all of his possessions in advance and have them waiting for her, but that she was not allowed to rummage through drawers or go into my roommate's room (we've lived together for 4 years, and she has no business invading her privacy), 3) would have friends there to make sure these boundaries were enforced, 4) would not allow any temper tantrums, nasty words, etc., and 5) said she could only come if she was with her partner, ex-FFIL, and ex-FFIL's wife.

&amp;#x200B;

What was her response to this? She messaged my brother and said the following. ""Your sister is being so mean to me"", and when he said he wasn't getting into it. She proceeded to call me ""evil"", said that she ""never wanted to see me again because I was a horrible person"", said I was ""trying to steal all of his stuff (what stuff????) and didn't deserve it because we hadn't been together very long"", and the KICKER of all of this that I was a bad fiancee because I didn't go and see FH when he was in detox (which wasn't allowed/recommended by his therapist) and that's why he died alone.

&amp;#x200B;

Consequently, I immediately messaged her partner and let her know that ex-FMIL was NOT welcome to come to our house. That I would be boxing up all of his possessions (including phone and computer) and giving everything to ex-FFIL and they could sort things out among themselves. We also let her know that we have surveillance (we got a nest doorbell) and will have friends (serving as security), ready to call the police if she trespasses on our property. Additionally, I've made it clear to her that I never want to talk to ex-FMIL or see her ever again. Finally, I told her partner that I would only continue to give them any medical records I obtain if ex-FMIL stops harassing me and my family/friends. Is there anything else we should think of or be prepared for?

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to be DONE with all of this so I can grieve. I haven't even been able to grieve because the past month have been consumed with dealing with ex-FMIL and figuring out how to navigate this. I've been doing all I can to set boundaries, but she does not respond. Please, any advice you have I'd appreciate.",JUSTNOMIL
"Normally my FMIL is a BEC but recently shes started tipping the scales and I need to vent. 

First and foremost is the house. She wants to move out toward us (they're only an hour away now, I'm not sure why she thinks moving closer will make us visit more...) their house is paid off, close to her husband's work and not too big or small. I sure as shit will NOT be over there more than I am now just because shes closer. 

Second is that she babysits my 11 month old. Which is fine. She used to be a preschool teacher and we dont have money for daycare and until I can work from home (fingers crossed I find something soon) shes our only option. But God help me, she doesn't get him to nap AT ALL. ALL DAY! hes under a year. He needs a fucking nap!! When he doesnt nap, he doesnt sleep through the night. I know he cries,  hes a baby, snuggle him and put him down. He napped fine for me for the past 2 months why the f cant you get him to nap?? Even 10 min, whatever. Ughhh. 

I'm having a hard time with being apart from my baby, my fiance knows this, hes looking for better work but with no degree its proving difficult. She makes him feel guiltier by telling him daily that he should be doing better so I dont have to work (she hasnt worked since he was 2) so then I have to reassure him that we're both doing what we can to make this work until we both find better jobs. 

I feel so guilty leaving my baby, especially now that hes aware I'm gone (going back at 12 weeks sucked but at least he didnt really know what was happening) and shes just making it 10x worse. Finace is still majorly in the fog and has issues with both parents (long story for another day) so I ...really dont know where to go from here :(

"Hey there, fellow friends with Demon-In-Laws.

I posted previously in r/relationships about my (future) dragon in law, so feel free to check out that post for any previous history / context.

My twin flame proposed to me two weeks ago. I’m absolutely over the moon happy, and so is he. We can’t stop smiling, can’t keep our hands off each other, totally attached at the hip....(yeah, we’re That Couple, I know— ew).

The fine people over at r/relationships warned me about what would happen if we got engaged, considering FDH mom’s JN behavior. He and I had multiple conversations about this possibility, and he expressed clearly that he would be prepared to go NC with her if she ever became “too much”, so I felt prepared to take on this next phase of life with him as my partner.

When FDH called her to announce our engagement, I expected her to hang up immediately. Instead, we got about 30-40 seconds of silence, during which FDH tried to get her to respond. Then sniffling which progressed quickly into hysterical, completely insane sobbing. She pretended she could hardly get her words out through the wailing, then hung up and texted him “how could you do this to me?”

He didn’t respond to the text, told me we would just let her compose herself and go do something fun together / not let her dampen our day. We turned our phones off and went out to get in the pool at our apartment complex. Upon returning just over two hours later, FDH had 30 text messages and 23 missed calls. She left only one voicemail, surprisingly lacking in tears, in which she called me a cunt and said if he married me she’ll never see him again.

FDH just shrugged in a resigned way and said “well that solves one problem.” I asked how in the world this resolves anything, and he responded, “it looks like I’ll never see her again.”

I know she’s being hyperbolic and most definitely will continue to harass us, but in that moment, I’d never loved him more.

Any advice on how to prepare for / handle the havoc she will no doubt try to wreak on our lives in the coming months? Right now, we’re specifically concerned about how to go about inviting my FFIL and FBIL 1 and 2 (who I love dearly) to the wedding while excluding MIL (which, after this new outburst, my future husband is okay with).",JUSTNOMIL
"Long time lurker, first time poster. So here’s a bit of backstory for my JNMom. 

My mom was never really involved with me as a child. My dad was on the road all the time for work while she stayed home, but she still dropped me off at my grandmothers house all the time so she wouldn’t have to parent. Her and my father eventually split when I was 9, leading to her bringing numerous men around me. 

I’m talking to the point where I don’t even remember names. I’d call them by days of the week and that was it. (That was honestly a lot less exhausting for me as a child. Which is pitiful but whatever. I’m fine now.) 

Fast forward to now, I’m 19(F) with a little girl on the way and am completely independent from her, so whatever she decides to do with her life is on her. I could care less. 

Well now she has this new boyfriend. He has no children, and never will. They’ve only been together a few months and he’s already talked about melting down the family heirloom to turn into an engagement ring for her. He butters up my entire family. She has already moved in with him (that happened about a week into their relationship, which is nothing new for her.), and he “treats her better than anyone else ever has”. (If I had a penny for every time she’s said this, I wouldn’t have to spend any money on my child’s upbringing.) 

Well, needless to say I don’t like him. And it’s not because of her history or anything, I honestly gave him a chance at first. But he ruined it insanely fast, and from the way they have acted, he’ll never get another one. 

So my mother will never be watching my daughter by herself. I’ve never seen how she parents, and every time she’s babysat I’ve witnessed her not give a single care about the parents rules for the child. So I just simply do not trust her. Her father or I can be there with her, or she won’t see her at all. 

Her and her boyfriend have other plans, though. They’ve already bought a mattress, a pack-n-play, and other things for “their house” for when “they have baby.” 

*I have repeatedly told her that she will not have my child without mine or my BF supervision and there is no reason for her to buy these things. 

Like I said before, her boyfriend has no children. And ever since they got together, all of a sudden he’s telling everyone “I get to be a grandpa without even fathering a child”. Normally I wouldn’t care if he claimed my child. But I don’t know him. He’s a stranger to me. And it makes me uncomfortable (voiced) that he’s claiming my daughter. I don’t even post photos of my bump or ultrasound on the book of faces anymore because I cannot trust him or my mother. 

She will save the photos and send them to him without my consent. Where he will then spread them to his friends and family without my consent. And that makes me incredibly uncomfortable. Strangers having photos of my ultrasounds? With my personal information on them? No thank you. 

She has also dubbed him a nickname and told him that I was the one who thought of it. Which is a lie. And I informed her that if she wants a healthy relationship so bad, then to stop lying and tell him the truth. Spoiler alert, she has not. 

They also do not call my daughter by her name. They call her by a nickname that her boyfriend thought of (and it hate it.) 

Her boyfriend has also not said a single word to my child’s father (BF) in the 5 times we’ve been around them. He has literally sat 2 feet away from BF for 2 hours, and didn’t even make eye contact. Which of course, makes BF lose all respect and wants him to have nothing to do with himself, me, and our baby. (Understandable in my opinion) 

Her boyfriend also has a niece with some health issues that make her a lot different from other children. But she deserves the same amount of love either way, especially since she’s his blood. Mine is not. And I have overheard him mention “it’ll be nice to not have a ‘broken’ baby to play with.” And it made me absolutely sick. 

They both whine and complain because I don’t want anyone in the delivery room or at the hospital the first day that my baby is born besides her father. “Well I’ll keep calling to bug you until you let me come up. She’s *our* grandbaby, we deserve to see her.” And so on. 

My grandmother had told me several times that I’m overreacting. And that I’m “too stuck up my dads ass to give this man a chance.”
When in reality he makes me uncomfortable and won’t listen to me when it concerns my own feelings about my own child. Same thing with my mother. 

I’m to the point where I want to refuse to let either of them see her until they can learn to respect my boundaries. Or just not let her boyfriend see my baby at all. 

I’m also afraid that if I let this slide, she will act the same way when she inevitably gets a new boyfriend. And I’m not going to sit back and let her do the same thing to my baby that she did to me. 

I’m not sure exactly what I’m wanting out of this post besides to hear what others has to say about it. Plus, it was nice to rant about this to someone else who isn’t my therapist (who also agrees that this man is creepy)",JUSTNOMIL
"My adoptive mother actually sent my adoption records, and I recieved them today. Most of the information is as I remembered it, but there were a few things that really stood out to me, now that I'm older.

This has always been something that seemed like wanted control over. I couldn't have my records. The photo album that had my biological parents photos was kept in their closet, so I had to ask to see if (which I of course couldn't really do). And so now I'm left wondering if this is really the end? I thought I had accepted losing a second set of parents already, but a little flame of hope was still lit. But now, that flame feels a bit dimmer....",JUSTNOMIL
"Okay, so I posted yesterday, but this came up today. As you can see with the bot, the story yesterday was about me coming clean to my husband about having our son vaccinated. My husband and his family are antivax so I hid the truth from DH about getting our son immunized, but I couldn't hold onto the guilt any longer and told him. I also revealed to my husband that my boss at work has said some inappropriate things to me when I first started working there about 2 months ago.

Now, obviously having your spouse hide anything from you will bring about some trust issues. I understand what I did wasn't right, but I had my reasons and DH and I are now on the mend. This all happened about 3 nights ago that all this was revealed. The last 2 days, my husband and I have been discussing the matter. All of a sudden tonight while further discussing the topic, he suddenly asks me if I have ever cheated on him, especially with my boss. At first, I kind of understood that the new found trust issues would cause this line of thinking, but then he goes on to say, ""Sorry, but all this makes me question it, and some other people have questioned it, as well.""

Then I remembered back to this morning when I dropped my son off at my inlaws house so I could go to work (currently working on getting that changed). One thing that MIL said was quote, ""You really have to think about if you even care about your family,"" when I mentioned how I was emailing a man about another job opportunity (one my inlaws told me about and gave me the information for) who happens to have the same name as my current boss.

I really didn't want my inlaws knowing about what my boss said to me because I still don't quite know how to process this since I have never been in this position before. Also because of a cultural difference (my boss is Indian) I wasn't quite sure if he was just being a bit overly friendly or if something was up. But because DH is more of a mama's boy than he likes to admit, he told them about it when seeking their advice. I'm not really mad at him, but he has been informed that in the future I don't want him revealing more info about me like that to them.

I know my husband hasn't discussed the issue with anyone other than them either because when I asked ""who have you talked to about all this"", he said just his parents. So, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that MIL planted the seed in his head. I will admit I kept getting our son vaccinated and my boss's behavior a secret, but I have never and never will cheat on my husband. I have crippling social anxiety for God's sake, I can barely make it through a normal conversation with a stranger let alone have sex with one.

In the past I have had inklings about MIL telling my husband I was cheating on him despite having no proof except for my ""wierd behavior"" (which is code for literally anything from picking a different flavor of ice cream at the store to actively avoiding her for  comment she made). It honestly is infuriating because there is absolutely no proof at all but once that worm is planted, its nearly impossible to get rid of.

I am so done. I am going LC from now on because this is honestly some major bullshittery that I will not stand. As soon as I can get my son into other childcare services, I am doing so.",JUSTNOMIL
"Ok, I have scrubbed this account so that I can have a clean slate to finally talk about my JNMom. 

Some background on her: I'm fairly certain that she is a narcissist, with me growing up as a Golden Child. My older siblings are (were) 14 and 12 years older than me. My oldest sister (14 years older), died of a drug overdose (SG, and now forever SG because she is dead). My brother and I are estranged, which I partly understand--as someone who heard how wonderful I am (especially in regards to his wife), it's easy to see how it is easier to consider me the enemy instead of my JNMom. 

Anyway.

I finally realized my mom was a JN when I got pregnant with my first baby girl. I suddenly had all of this anxiety and fear that I would end up hurting my daughter. I still get some PTSD flashbacks of my JNMom's abuse (mostly getting smacked around, uncontrollable rage on her part, jealousy, etc). I had married a really wonderful man, and she is all over him. He is just the *perfect man*. She is on her best behavior around him. She calls him ""son"" (it makes him very uncomfortable). 

Some choice examples of her JustNO behavior:

* she wanted to give me the ""wedding of our dreams"" but refused to give us a budget, thereby allowing her to complain about the cost. A few weeks before the wedding, she called me asking to change the menu to add LOBSTER because, ""Well it's *my day too!*"" 
* At my wedding, she leaned over to me and accused my D\[ear\]H's grandparents of infidelity because, ""How could you be together for over 60 years without someone cheating. I bet he cheated on her."" I was disgusted--my DH's grandparents are so sweet and amazing and she is fuuuucking bitter.
* I became pregnant with my first baby the year we got married. I was talking to her about how sweet the baby was, and she said, ""But what if she turns out to be a bitch when she comes out?"" 
* Show insisted on paying for the baby shower--same story as the wedding. As soon as everyone was gone, she bashed my friend who had a little more wine than usual, calling her a sloppy drunk (she wasn't), and then complaining about the cost. 
* I told her the name of my baby--she was one of the only people who knew. She bragged to my (estranged) brother that she knew the name, causing him to attack me via text message. I haven't spoken to him since. 
* She and my In-laws visit for my first baby overlapped. She refused to eat a lunch that was prepared by my JYMIL because, ""I wasn't invited."" ... We were all staying in the same house, but she wanted a special invitation to lunch. She pouted about it.
* When I became pregnant with my second, she was visiting. ""You're already looking puffy."" she said to me, at about 11 weeks pregnant. I did not. 
* She also pointed to my belly and said, ""I don't know how I will ever love *that one* as much as I love \[DD1\]."" 
* I brought up her abuse on one of her visits, and she (of course) had a huge breakdown, ""I had no idea that you *thought* that you were ABUSED!"" Me: You hit me as a kid, Her: You were doing scary things! (coded: you deserved it)
* She also told me that she *wished* I would have told her, at 11, that I had father issues (my bio-dad left when I was 2). My key phrase back to her in these conversations is ""I was a child. You were the adult."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I am in counseling pretty regularly, and now I have baby 3 on the way. She has transformed from an angry, domineering presence in my life, to one that I mostly dominate, tolerate, and gray rock. She is passive aggressive, highly strung, and deeply afraid that I will cut her out of my life, as she saw me do to my brother. I won't lie and say that I have used that fear against her, but I am trying not to as I move forward. 

She won't change, and I know that in the 10 days that she will be here to ""help"" with baby #3, I'll have lots of fun antidotes about it. My husband and I have taken to making bingo cards on her visits, marking off some choice phrases, casual racism, and other things she does that grate on me in an attempt to laugh it off. 

So welcome to my hilarious JNMom! I'm so glad this forum exists!",JUSTNOMIL

"So this is an old story but a goodie.  It should have been a big clue as to what my future had in store for me...but you know how it is when you are in the FOG, naive, and in love......

So back in the day when I was still fully in the FOG and a total people pleaser  when it came to family anyway my DH of 2 years proposed to me.  It was wonderful, simple, intimate but special. He told me to get dressed up, took me to a special spot, got down on one knee.  My heart was pounding and I don't remember a thing he said but I said yes and we are happily married now for 5 yrs.....  Little did I know that my FMIL Turditzen was plotting in the background to be involved in the excitement and moment of her baby boy.   When we called to tell her the news she said oh yes we (FIL and I) went down to \[public but intimate proposal spot\] earlier in the day hoping to see it!! And goes on to tell us about her day there and how she sat on a bench and became best friends with some stranger sitting on it too.. Luckily storms had come through that day and future DH had delayed things so we were not outside in the rain all dressed up and we missed each other time wise.     

She then tells everyone when we retell the story about how hilarious it was that she tried to witness our proposal uninvited.  This diverted attention to her during the story re-telling of course.  Everyone mainly rolled their eyes at her and it annoyed me greatly.  (Bigger warning bells should have been going off in my head than the ones that did  imagine a mini toy police car vs the real thing lol)  Why can't JustNos let their boys be grown up and butt out of their lives during adult moments?!?!

"My mom's first email was a total fake, she accepted full responsibility and said she would honor my boundaries, and she would stop guilting and controlling me. 

She sent this as a follow up two days later when I didn't reply ""Can I ask if you are ok ..... I cannot ever express enough my love , worry and concern for you and I want to help you in any and every way .... 
I can accept and live with my own guilt and regrets but I can’t come to terms with having you feel abandoned at this precious time in your life . 
Love mom""

My therapist explained it as she is projecting her OWN fear of abandonment onto me and she needs a reply to PACIFY her own emotions. Also, she wants to get me back close to things can resume to normal.

Everything inside me tells me to respond and make it better but i'm not gonna do that.

Im sticking to my boundaries. I'm going to reply acknowledging her email and letting her know I will contact them when ready. 

Heres the kicker, me and DH have my mom and FM dad blocked, by some fluke a text from my dad came in today on DH computer, a text he sent two fridays ago.

This is the same FM dad that deleted me off FB after I asked for space in January.

""DH, is anything wrong? My text to [my daughter] are green and messenger is turned off. Im very worried.""

""Sorry, ignore my text as apparently i'm out of the loop. [MOM] tells me i'm not suppose to contact you guys for a bit...and I HAVE TO FUCKING IDEA WHY and she informed me she will tell me later. Anyway, so sorry I reached out as I am apparently out of the loop about the latest contact restrictions. 

Anyways, I'll take my frustrations out on [Mom] for NOT keeping me updated""

"Thank you to everyone that replied to my last post. It really helped and I used the advice on how to move forward. Execution didn't go as well as I planned. I even had my SO there to help me stay on track and keep the conversation going.. That woman is like a freaking pro and I have been trained well to let her just talk and talk when she is. Anyways, on to what happened..

That day after I posted, I decided to call her again and explain why she was out of line, how accusing me of lying isn't the way to go and explain why this shower is the way it is. One of you guys gave me a very useful text on what to say, even SO said it was perfect and explained what we were both saying in a very clear way. I wanted to add the bit of her accusing me a lying at the beginning and then lead into that. So we sat down together, put the phone on speaker and called. She, as always, answers with ""Hey Sweetie"" which is really getting on my nerves. I am getting tired of the pet names from this woman. So I ask if she has a minute to talk, she does and so I start going in. I explain that accusing me of lying wasn't a good way to start the call. She interrupts me and says no she didn't do that. I said yes she did.. She said nooo I was said I was trying to find a way to say it without upsetting you.. and I pointed out ""and ended it with 'and I am wondering why you lied about that?'"" She the goes, ""well its not like I called you a big fat liar"" I am rolling my eyes and SO is like WTF off to the side and trying to help me get back on track. I try to take the conversation back over and she interrupts me again, ""well if I said lying it was because it was the first thing that came to my mind about it.."" and I am thinking what the hell is this woman on and I said ""Let me finish talking. I wasn't done"" But she kept going on and on. I will be honest, at this point I was getting emotional and I don't have great recollection. She was mouthing off and SO was trying his best to help me as I referred to my notes. So I mute the phone so he can talk and she starts to go, ""Well the lying might have been mentioned because at Thanksgiving you said you were out of town but you weren't and went to Friend's"" and I hung up. 

Now when we loosely patched up, we said we weren't going to hash out past events. I was even told it was ridiculous to bring up my birthday party after 3 months. Not only that, but she started to drag some other BS into a conversation. This is what the woman does, she derails, derails, derails so the attention isn't on her aggression but on how she's the victim. It drives me nuts. Well she calls back and leaves and pause heavy voicemail. It was literally 35 seconds long and she spoke for like 5-10 of those. After talking with SO, I decided to send a message about why I hung up. I will go ahead and copy below. (Shout out to u/[Luminous\_Kells](https://www.reddit.com/user/Luminous_Kells) for the message)

""I'm glad we had the phone conversation yesterday. The following is a recap of my thoughts about it all.

First, we cleared up your confusion about Friend's shower not being for my friends --- 95% of the guests are my friends. Friend who is hosting simply asked her mom for some help regarding venue and such --- that doesn't change what the shower is all about and more, it really isn't any of your business how Friend handles the shower SHE is throwing.

Second, now you and dad understand that I have and will maintain connections to the rest of my family separate from my connections to you. You and I weren't talking when I invited Grandma to this shower, but I still wanted her to be included in some of the celebrations anyway. This was the best fit. At that point, adding Friend's Grandma was a no-brainer. Think of this as a natural consequence of the problems you and I were having.

I can see where you and Dad are coming from but you know I'm not ""leaving you out"" of anything; you're throwing one of my showers, for crying out loud! It's just that not everything that has to do with me and my baby has to do with you, grandparents or not. You are a part of my life, but you aren't the only part. And it's great that we are establishing these kind of clear boundaries now, before LO is born.  

Finally, I hung up because you started to add things into the conversation that were not involved. We agreed less than a month ago that we were starting ""new"" and not bringing up past instances. If you had an issue from Thanksgiving, you should have brought that up at Restaurant. It's ridiculous that would bring something else into this from that far back after you and Dad sat there and said I was for bringing up my birthday. That isn't constructive in anyway as you both pointed out. So I will not be discussing anything that has happened before May with you or Dad. I was discussing the conversation from yesterday, and nothing else. I appreciate you sharing your feelings, but I was trying to explain why we made those decisions and what happened. Your feelings do not trump all talking points in a conversation and when new information is added, doubling down on more reasons why your feelings are the way they are without taking into account anything I said. That said, I'm not comfortable with you guys coming over next weekend. You have a habit of interrupting me when I am in the middle of explaining myself over the phone or in person and pick apart pieces of my points without getting the full picture. I'm tired of being interrupted and not able to fully explain my side without you arguing some tiny point and the whole conversation being derailed. So I am done talking about all for now. We can try again next week. ""

She couldn't help herself and responded with this nice message, with names redacted: 

"" You say you are glad we talked, but your actions say something completely different.  

If you would have listened to the rest of what I said instead of acting the way you did, I don't think you would be upset right now. The conversation was not going where you thought it was.   

I am trying so hard to talk to you as an adult  but you are making it so hard. You asked me once if I talked to Mom's Friend a certain way, well I'm going to ask you, do you hang up on Friend?  

Why do you feel the need to punish us every time you get mad at us? Is this what you think adults do?  I'm ready to have a healthy adult relationship with you.  Not a relationship where I have to listen to everything you say and you have the right to hang up, storm out or drive away on me. ""

Followed with:

""I am sorry if I continuously talk over you. I did not even realize I was doing it. Please let me know as I'm doing it not later. ""

I haven't responded to these messages. I said I would try again next week and fully meant it. I also had a baby shower to attend and a lot of work to do. But she doesn't even mention a thing I talked about and that apology is crap imo.. SO even said I said multiple times to let me finish and talk but she just kept going. He says that next time I just need to keep talking, but my reaction is to just shut up and let her have the floor after so many years of dealing with her rants. The next day she sends another message with a picture of a jacket and this "" Came in the mail. An OshKosh sweater jacket for this winter.  Too dang cute "" I also ignored this, because WTF.. like I said I would try again next week, stop pushing! So the shower happens and Grandma comes but she came with even more BS from mother. Mother sent a present along to shower.. but Grandma is supposed to give it to me afterwards and not let me open it up in front of everyone. It's like she is just trying to be the damn victim in this. Why not save this for the shower that will happen later? I really don't get it.. At the point I was between NC or just letting it go and going VVVVVLC. I honestly want to tell her that she obviously won't be the mother that want/need and I won't be that daughter to her, so lets just cut the crap and be cordial but quit trying to force interaction. I don't agree with the way she acts, what she says or what she believes.. I can't fake it anymore and don't have the energy. At this point, I sent a text through a group with Mom, Dad and SO thanking them for the present they sent. I wasn't about to call her to thank her.. seemed like a trap. Haha! 

&amp;#x200B;

But yeah, that is the update. The shower otherwise was wonderful and I had a blast with all my friends. I was worried that the mix of groups from SO's friends and my friends would be a little awkward but it turned out great. LO got a good haul of presents and I can't wait to go through them this week and set up his nursery more. :)",JUSTNOMIL
"Hello, all. This is mostly BEC, but it’s a small victory so I’m taking it!

My and FDH’s wedding is in about a month and a half. Things are coming together quickly. FDH is rather handy, so he made the arch and is keeping it in the garage at MIL’s house. We bought some fabric to decorate it today, and he convinced me to go over there “just to check and see that we got enough fabric.” 

MIL is home, of course, because where else would she be. She’s salty that we bought the fabric rather than letting her buy it, and keeps hovering and telling FDH what to do. She’s repeating herself and really not helping at all. She starts snapping at me, telling me how to “help.” I roll my eyes and ignore her, and now she’s cranky that I’m not listening. FDH snaps at her, saying “OP is doing just fine! She’s doing what I need her to do! So don’t tell her what to do because you’re not helping!” Cue CBF from MIL. FDH and I get everything situated, and it looks great. 


Now MIL starts to change her tune, and play nice. I get suspicious. And after a while, she asks me where to get her makeup done. I told her it’s only $50 at Sephora. She replied “Oh great, would you mind texting the information to me?” Aaaaaaand, there it is! MIL is still blocked on social media, as well as her number. FDH mentioned the other day that she’s mad that she’s still blocked. However, I never said that I would unblock her. So I just grin and bear it, and start asking FDH questions about the arch.


A little while later, MIL comes in and asks FDH and his best friend who’s now joined us if they want anything from the store. FDH says “a Snickers,” FDH’s best friend says “a Reese’s.”


A little while later, MIL gets back from the store. Hands FDH his Snickers, and asks best friend “And you had the Three Musketeers?” And tosses him a Milky Way. (Wtf? And no Reese’s.) 
Before she leaves the room, I hand her a piece of paper, where I wrote down the link for the Sephora website. I told her, “Here you go, MIL! I wrote down the store for the makeover for you.” 😁

Now, the CBF flashes over instantly, but I gave her the information she asked me to, and I gave it to her in front of FDH and the best friend. No being able to say she didn’t notice the piece of paper or whatever; too many witnesses. She puts a pitifully fake smile on and goes “Oh...oh, well thank you!”

Only about a month and a half to go. 😈",JUSTNOMIL
"I feel like I’m constantly being attacked in this community because my spine isn’t steel and I’m gradually working my way to it. There is obviously some background to why the way I am but I don’t have to tell anyone my history. I ask for gentle advice sometimes and that’s all I should have to say. People who are just attacking me, look at yourself in the mirror because you’re honestly a JustNo yourself.



This weekend was our monthly visit to Snatchys home. I almost didn’t go and didn’t have to but I did. My BIL is going back to NY to do his residency and this trip would be very short. If I didn’t visit yesterday, I probably would have been asked to commit to a whole day another weekend so I just said yes to this one. 

It wasn’t as annoying as the others but Snatchy is Snatchy. Just a few things that irked me this time like Snatchy trying to put DD to sleep in a stroller. DD only will take a light bouncing and then she goes right to sleep but Snatchy has had this fantasy of strolling around DD in a stroller for months. She actually bought us a gift from BIL and when we found out it was a stroller and wanted to return it since we had one, she insisted that we just keep it there and my DH didn’t talk her out of it. It was like it was not a choice and that stroller has NEVER been used until yesterday. She tried to push DD around in the house but the stroller kept hitting walls. 

I let her do it to prove a point that DD would not go to sleep in that and eventually after DD stopped being intrigued, became fussy so I came, got her and took her to the back spare bedroom and put her to sleep.

During lunch, Snatchy asked my DH about our day at the park. She only spoke in her mother language the whole time and I kept asking what was being said. DH is suppose to ask Snatchy to speak in English from our marriage counselors advice but he did not. 

Anyway, Snatchy apparently told us we need to be careful at the park because there are “baby snatchers”, I laughed and she told me that she had some alerts on her phone the previous week. I told her they are most likely to be FAMILY MEMBERS and I said it with such a look, I’m sure she understand that I meant her. 

Btw I know strangers snatch babies too but most of the amber alerts in our area are from domestic disputes.  I know it can happen from strangers too.

DD has been teething and she has thrush so she’s been a bit whiny lately. She cried 2x when picking her up from Snatchy. She never cries like this but like I said, she did and Snatchy took this as DD couldn’t be separated from her so Snatchy was super excited that DD KNOWS her sooo much and cries for her 🙄

When we were leaving and going to walk the 15ft from the front door to the car, Snatchy ignored DHs request that she didn’t need a blanket (it was just windy but it was fine) and walked her out wrapped in her own robe (kangaroo style). I was irritated but DH allowed that to happen. When I tried to remove DD, she was wrapped so tightly and began to cry because Snatchy had a death grip on her. Again, Snatchy took that as DD did not want to leave her and her home... 

I almost elbowed Snatchy in the face who was screaming over my shoulder to DD as I buckled her into the car. I told my husband about some of the crazy but of course he just remained silent. I actually told him yesterday that I hated her. I’m sure that’s not going to help our marriage but I was so irritated.

Last night I just found out I was pregnant. I took some home tests and they were unclear but this test was from the doctor’s office. 

I’m sure I’m hormonal but yesterday I couldn’t wait to scrub Snatchys scent from DD when we got home. I’m also freaking out because I don’t want Snatchy to think this means she has more access to DD since we have another baby on the way.

ALSO Snatchy throughout my pregnancy kept hoping DD was a girl and that girls are the BEST. She emphasizes on this every single visit. It makes me wonder if I have a boy this time around, will he always be considered second? Should I even care since that means Snatchy will leave him alone?",JUSTNOMIL
"Please read my previous posts for an idea but basically I had to rush my son to hospital recently and had to reluctantly ask mil to watch my 2yr old.

I told her that miss 2 yr old was also under the weather so only take her to our apartments bbq area ""we are within walking distance to the mall and i was taking the pram with me"" mil knows shes never to walk next to the busy main road with my daughter unless she is in a pram.

While in hospital she calls to say she walked to the mall with my daughter. I was furious and ended the call, my partner was fed up with her so he left work early to come home and find our daughter on the balcony by herself while mil was on the lounge watching TV. He lost it, I then came home to find my daughter with pen in her ear, all over our lounge which mil tried to hide with a massive beach towel and the pen and paper my daughter was drawing on was on the bench ""mil had left before I arrived home"" I left it to my partner to confront her which she lied through her teeth and accused us of attacking her. 

Fast forward a few more days and she msgs me about winter clothes for the kids. I wasn't letting her rug sweep this time so I was fairly blunt in my reply. So she calls playing dumb asking why I'm annoyed. I laid out why I was annoyed and this narcissist monster in law chucked a 10 year old tantrum told me none of those incidents happened and even told me I never told her not to take my daughter anywhere but the bbq area. I had enough by this point and let loose, I tore her apart and told her that she had lost all babysitting privileges permanently and we want nothing to do with her until the lying and appalling behavior is rectified and she takes accountability.

This morning I received a call from my dr saying my mil has contacted the clinic saying shes concerned for me that I'm unstable and irrational and to intervene!!!

I have never seen so much red! I contacted her telling her shes the most manipulative piece I've ever met and if she ever came near me again I'd knock her on her arse.

She replied saying she did it out of love because my lying and made up thoughts and situations aren't normal etc etc.

My partner lost it and we have both blocked her and agreed she is never allowed back in our lives.

UPDATE: I contacted the police who were understanding and amazing and said they can't do anything just yet but if it results in her harassing me or going to CPS to call them again and they will intervene. He also informed me that to make a false accusation with say CPS is a federal offense and she can be arrested and charged.",JUSTNOMIL
"Lurked here for a while and posted once under my primary account that my FDH knows. Switching to this one to keep things private for now.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll lay it out straight: I thought I was getting a great FMIL. A little set in her ways and a strong personality, but a nice enough person. She hugged me goodbye after only knowing me a few hours, for instance. But things started coming out, especially after FDH proposed. She tells me she used to want to be a wedding planner, and I can see she wants to help me plan and design everything. I'm incredibly grateful for the florist she found who is effectively charging us nothing. But things just keep happening:

&amp;#x200B;

\-I'll mention I like a certain color or style, she'll all but spam me with Pinterest links or other things in FB Messenger.

\-She constantly makes me second-guess myself or just denies something I say (recent example: I don't think we need longer than about 10 minutes to seat our wedding guests, most of whom are adults and should have no trouble finding seats. She would not let me outline this completely and kept cutting in about how we need at least 20 if not more. I know some older people need longer, but she just would. Not. Shut. Up.)

\-She recently told FDH that she always thought of marriage as gaining a daughter and she's afraid she's going to lose a son instead. It's about us starting a family, lady, not you getting another kid!!

\-She constantly puts me on the defensive when we talk. It could be something as simple as whether or not the ceramic measuring spoons she gave me for my birthday are usable or just decorations, she always has to be right and it's exhausting to try explaining my viewpoint.

\-She's joked before that she would disown her son (FDH) if he voted for a candidate she didn't like. She was joking, but who jokes about something like that?

\-FDH has seen the same behavior and says that when he confronts her, he always gets told she didn't mean it like that and he's misinterpreting things. Once or twice, sure, but a constant stream? He didn't seem entirely convinced when I told him there comes a point where it's no longer you misinterpreting but the other person trying to make you ok with it.

\-She agreed to contribute to our already low-budget wedding, but instead of contributing toward something we actually agreed we wanted and planned for, she's insisting on throwing a rehearsal dinner or get-together and paying for that as her contribution. So, basically she's increasing our budget, covering the increase, and calling that helping. It honestly infuriates me. I never wanted a rehearsal dinner and I hate the fact that she won't just accept that and try something else.

&amp;#x200B;

To the inciting incident: FDH and I were having a talk over the phone about wedding planning last week and it was going well. We were making plans, comparing two different venues, flirting, and giggling. He asked if we could involve our moms and I agreed, though we had to wait since both moms were out of the house. His came home first and he put her on the phone...and I sat there for about twenty minutes, mindlessly scrolling on my computer, while the two of them talked and barely spoke to me. FDH was apparently on the other side of the room because all I could hear was her responses to him and to me when I tried to say something. Every idea was nitpicked or shut down by her. When my own mom eventually got home and we talked to her instead, I was so frustrated I could barely talk even to her (mostly JYes at least in regards to wedding stuff). My excitement for this new venue turned into dread and I told FDH that the idea of a minimal courthouse wedding (which he doesn't want) looked real appealing.

&amp;#x200B;

That was when I realized I couldn't marry him if this continued. I could not live with that woman constantly sticking herself into my life. I tried to tell him then but I just couldn't and said I wanted to talk again after having slept on it.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I slept on it. My mind never changed. The next night I called with every intention of ending the engagement. I won't repeat our entire discussion here, but he agrees with me that FMIL is overbearing and he's relieved he's not the only one who sees it. That said, he didn't want to break up and he doesn't seem like he fully sees what his mother's behavior is doing to me. I do not have a strong personality, and faced with opposition like she gives me, I shut down. I can't keep going like this. I love him and want to marry him, but I can't stand her. We ended up agreeing to postpone wedding planning until tonight, when we'll have another call and see where we stand.

&amp;#x200B;

Also: the call tonight will partially involve her to lay out some of the problems. I honestly have no idea what to do to keep her from turning this into a pity party for her. Help?",JUSTNOMIL
"My mind is spinning as I’m 33 weeks pregnant &amp; very hormonal. So I’m sorry this isnt very detailed I just need to get it off my chest. I’m also on mobile. Would you take both of the following comments as hurtful/inappropriate if said (by the same person) about your unborn child? 

1. If you’re greedy with the baby and don’t let (abuser) see him God will get angry. If he gets angry something bad will happen to the baby, he could take the baby from you.

"Hey All 👋 I need more help with my MIL drama. (TIA!)

How do I do family events when hubby and I are no contact with my Narc MIL? 
There are some milestones in my husband’s family and his narc mom is at the center of everything. I’ve gotten advice not to let her be the gate keeper but I also have no desire to listen to her BS. Most family gatherings all go the exact same way: MIL (is single), her sister, sisters husband, my BIL w/ his wife and baby, an adult cousin or two, and my husband and I. Sometimes my MIL’s brother &amp; his wife come and bring their adult children. We all gather at the grandparents’ house. We usually eat the same foods and it’s pretty routine after 8.5 years. It has been the place where my MIL and I have gotten into arguments. 

So we have been no contact for less than a month and we are trying to figure this whole thing out. We want to see some of the family but it would compromise the no contact. Yes, we can take the grandparents out for lunch or hang out with cousins but we also want to join the group from time to time. What can I say to the family members we still want a relationship with without escalating things? Is there a way I can deal with my MIL and be there or is it really best to stay away!? Also, my MIL’s sister always takes her side and is very similar to my MIL so we may become and issue. We just don’t know yet. 

Sorry of this is jumbled. It’s late but my mind is racing. She’s trying to Hoover and it’s stressful. Thanks for any help! 💕",JUSTNOMIL
"The long and short of it is: 
Since Y2K my JNMIL has been a problem.
 
-She was 2 hours late to a bridal luncheon and because I didn’t gush and fawn over her when she finally arrived, she called my DH crying  that I was nasty and cruel and refused to speak to her. (Naw, bitch, you rolled in 2 hours late, and I didn’t worship you like DH used to- so I’m the bad guy? I think not.)

-2 weeks after our wedding she started talking about “practicing to be a grandma” I said to her face- because in my family you are honest- we never said we were having kids, let alone right away, so you might want to ratchet it back a few notches. I got an email (nasty grams are her fave way to communicate) telling me I DID promise to have kids right away.  

- She barged into the L&amp;D room while I was in labor with MY first despite strict orders to the contrary. 

-she asked us to lie to her own son so she didn’t have to invite him to Christmas.

-Her grandchildren are her only joy and we are cruel and awful to not allow her unfettered access. (She currently has zero access, after about 10 years of very little access.)

-this past winter she sends a nasty gram to DH and his bro saying “fuck off and die” lose but accurate translation. DH’s brother 2 months later.... Died.

We’ve been no contact for 7/8 glorious months. DH is now attempting to establish contact with his father. I think this is a terrible idea- he sat back and watched, joined in, etc each time she went full narc on our asses... whatever makes DH think he is reachable or worth saving is completely beyond me...

I want to strategize and discuss and DH is like “I don’t want to be anxious going in”. But I want to shake him and say “It took you 35 years to realize the way you were raised was abusive. You’ve been woke for 8 months and you think you can go into the belly of the beast and keep your wits about you?!?!

I was hoping to never deal with these manipulative morons ever again. I find myself unable to bite my tongue from trying to give DH pep talks about things he could say, things he might consider not worth engaging in, etc.  He is now getting annoyed with me about it.

I wish I could bite my tongue- but his mom told his brother to fuck off and die and then he DID and the ONLY thing she wanted to talk to DH about was how she was a good mother. 

Strategies for keeping it to myself? So I don’t come across and pestering when I’m trying to be empowering? Ways to keep DH from being drawn back to the dark side? (They don’t have cookies just piles of sadness).",JUSTNOMIL
"I’ve posted before on another account about my MIL that likes to send DH nasty emails about me and me special needs/rescue animals for three straight years now. Basically telling him she hopes we all die (except DH of course) and although I’ve paid for both our houses, and all of our vehicles I’m just using him for money. Oh and that he needs a woman “just like her.” 

Also sorry for formatting, I don’t even know what that is so I’m sure I’ve screwed it up! 

Most recently my son (not biologically DH’s but he’s raised him since he was a toddler) went on a week long trip to visit my awesome family. I stayed at home to care for the critter portion of our family and DH went at the end of the week to pick him up. 

His mother lives in the same city as my family and he stopped by to see her and take her for lunch. She was of course wasted when he showed up and threw a massive fit that he wouldn’t be spending the night at her house as kiddo had missed him terribly and wanted him nearby. He ended up going to see her two more times on a one day trip only for her to say God knows what about me and my son.  Why he kept going back I will never understand...

Anyways, once they got home his phone would not stop going off. Turns out she had been texting and emailing him the entire 25 hour drive. 

The contents of all of those? 

“That kid is a pawn” referring to ds. 

She’ll  never support this.

I’m “an opportunistic freak” (honestly surprised she even knew that word) 

that he is a willing victim and I’m setting him up? 

That he’s no longer her son and writing him out of her will.... Guys, she’s never owned her own home, only one year ago has she even gotten her own vehicle so she basically only has debt.  

She’s dead to him now and he doesn’t give her the time of day. 

Of course she later texts a couple empty “I’m sorry I was drunk” then tried to rug sweep by saying no one will hang up her “blankey” for her.... 

DH just says “I love you mom.” 

Jeez I’m mad.


Edit: a word",JUSTNOMIL
"…at least for the next month until my in-laws visit, then I can get drunk on less since my tolerance will be laughable.  Much easier to hide my drinking when it only takes a glass or two to get me plastered. 

First, before I jump into our upcoming adventures with the in-laws, I wanted to thank this community from the bottom of my heart.  A few of you encouraged me to get help after my not so minimally traumatic birth and the twins’ NICU time and I was able to find someone who has helped me tremendously with my PPA and Postpartum PTSD (both of which I didn’t even know existed prior to this).  DH (who has worked his way back from damn to dear husband after a disastrous visit with the in-laws) continues to make progress with his therapist.  He’s read and participated in every post, even my last one, and y’all have really helped him get perspective on everything.

Ok, now onto the MIL nonsense!

In early July we will be getting the band back together to celebrate the twin’s first 100 days (or in this case the first 100 days out of the NICU).  Yes, we (alright, mostly me) have in fact lost our damn minds.  But y’all…I saw the cute outfits they could wear and my brain short circuited and decided to insist we have a party.  Logical and reasonable.

As I mentioned in previous posts I am white and my DH is Chinese/Vietnamese, so everything I know about throwing a 100 day party is from google.  Y’all remember when I said my brain short circuited? Yeah…well I decided to reach out to my MIL to 1. Make sure I wasn’t doing anything culturally offensive, 2. Find out what means the most to them to include, and 3. Make her feel like she’s a part of it (mend fences and all that).

I’m happy to report that the conversation actually went well!  (that is until she talks to DH and he tells me what she interpreted from what I actually said)  Still taking the win!  I actually had good responses/back up plans to everything she brought up:

-She wants to make the red eggs for the party.  I said sure, why not?  I mean, I know how it’s going to go, she’s going to stress about making 24 red eggs for the 3 days they are visiting prior and won’t really enjoy her time with the kids.  She will also try and make them at the last minute.  DH wanted her to have one thing she can do so she feels like she’s contributing. Cool, but our compromise is that she has to finish the day before or we won’t have red eggs.  I’m fine without them, and my kitchen will not be a disaster because she can’t get her shit together the day before.  I absolutely will unplug my oven the day of if she tries to make it that morning.  Sad when ovens just break like that 

-She wants to buy the kids jewelry for the 100 days.  In fact she told me not to buy it. Eh, sure, why not?  If it’s ugly the chain may just break that day and they can’t wear it.  Tragic.

-She wants to buy the roast pork.  What a nice offer.  Except of course it’s at the place near us that doesn’t sell the other food we are picking up.  So of course that means they will be panicking the day of stressing about picking up the roast pork.  I put her off this at the moment saying that the restaurant we are getting the food from might be cheaper (probably a lie), but I may just let her go ahead and get the pork.  Then she’ll be out of the house the morning of and I can start openly drinking earlier. (don’t worry I have a lot of other food lined up if this falls through)

I also have a few surprises for her (insert devilish grin here).  She does not know that I plan to do all the decorating before they arrive, a whole week before the party.  Is that crazy? Absolutely.  But me being the sweet and considerate DIL that I am, I just want to make sure they have enough time with the babies.  That also means I get to decorate without any input from anyone.  Huh.  Who would’ve thought?

Speaking of which, we have fun outings planned to the Aquarium and the butterfly exhibit on the days leading up to the party.  Just because the babies are still potatoes shouldn’t stop us!  It’s important to get out and learn at an early age. MIL and FIL don’t like aquariums or expensive museums? What?!? Color me shocked.  Too bad we aren’t spending all day at the house while they make a mess, nap and talk about how bored they are.  And wait…Chinatown is nowhere near the museum district?  God maps are confusing.  I guess MIL will have to live with not going to a Chinese food restaurant where she orders for everyone and I sit and stare at the food (I’m not against all Chinese food, but the stuff she orders doesn’t settle well).

And for the grand finale: our new nanny!  She is a gift from above and the kids ADORE her (seriously if I have to choose between DH and new nanny I would choose nanny…sorry hubs).  New nanny needs hours since she goes back to school in august, and wouldn’t you know, these outings are a lot of work.  We know how tired the in-laws get here with the heat and we don’t want to inconvenience them on their vacation. Can’t have them overdoing it.  After all, we’re supposed to take care of our elders.  Guess the new nanny will just come over during the whole visit to help out.  It’s unfortunate that she’s soooooo good with the kids and doesn’t need help caring for them.  Between her and me taking care of the babies, there won’t be any babies left to care for. Sad. 

While the thought of their visit fills me with dread, I’m happy to report that DH and I are shining up our spines and outlining our strategies.  We’re also stocking up on alcohol.  Basically, we’re prepping for it like we prep for a hurricane.  That way if the house blows over and the power goes out, if every worst case scenario hits at the same time, at least we’ll have enough alcohol to drink all of our fucks away.

Tl;dr Alcohol drowns all the fucks we have, new nanny is a super hero, and OP has contingencies for her contingencies, a titanium spine, grey rocks for dayssssss, and a couple of surprises up her sleeves – the perfect storm to defeat a MIL.",JUSTNOMIL
"The more I talk about my childhood with Vacuunt, the more I realize how messed up it is. Therapy is helping me unpack a lot of my life, and I appreciate that. I guess I finally feel safe enough to remember things that happened to me, things that make me do seemingly illogical things that now suddenly make sense. Things that come in flashbacks that make me sick to my stomach. Things that come from triggers I haven't yet identified, and I don't know how much I don't remember still.

&amp;#x200B;

You know the list of behaviors that are warning signs of abuse? That was me, to a T. I stopped bathing, had an eating disorder, pulled out my hair, etc. ad nauseam. Somebody should've paid attention. Somebody should have cared. I tried to tell my teacher but they told Vacuunt and that just rained shit on me when I got home. I tried to tell a relative that I loved and trusted and they just called me insulting names, when I was a child who shouldn't have known what I knew.

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn't even allowed to meet with my doctors privately. I now see that was intentional. Just like their unwillingness to let me get involved in activities outside of school, or making friends that I hung out with outside of school.

&amp;#x200B;

SO pointed out that neither Vacuunt, nor my EFather, nor FM, ever show me anything approximating affection. I wasn't allowed to hug my parent past puberty because it made my parent uncomfortable. They may give a fist bump, but most of the time it's freaking awkward. They knew my fears and they tailored my punishments to align with them, to the point I still feel fear around certain situations.

&amp;#x200B;

They're never affirming. I can't even disagree with their outdated and prejudiced views before being berated. Everything is always my fault, and I'm talking everything. E.g. it's my fault they read my journal because I wrote about them and they're entitled to know what I think about them. It's an endless litany, an endless loop, and I can't take it anymore. So I've taken to saying, very calmly, No, that's not my fault. That was your choice. At least that makes me feel like I'm sticking up for myself.

&amp;#x200B;

" I’ve been lurking here for almost four years now, but I think it’s finally time for me to post and get some of the supportive advice you all are known for. FYI, I will be fudging some unimportant small details, since I posted on a different (but similar) sub over a year ago and my BIL found it. He didn’t for SURE realize it was me, but sent it to my husband and said “haha this could be OP!” If he were to find this post I’m not sure how well it would go over. DH knew I posted and was completely fine with me asking for advice, but didn’t want to see the post or the comments. Please let me know if I have broken any rules!

&amp;#x200B;

OK so there’s a TON of backstory here. I don’t know that it’s all pertinent so I’ll keep it to the basics and elaborate if necessary. I’ve been with DH for 12 years, married for 6, two kids DD3 and DS1. DH warned me about MIL right from the beginning, saying she was overbearing, sometimes crazy; I’d give him flack for ignoring her texts and calls (yeah, so naive). Things were OK until our wedding, mostly BEC type things but then MIL started in on how my family was so wealthy (not true and is frankly insulting given their vacation property and full ownership of their home, buying new cars every 4-5 years, etc, whereas my parents are teachers), she said they were trying to take over the wedding and called it the ‘OP family reunion’ - I do come from a large family and they from quite small families, but DH made it clear that all of BOTH OF OUR uncles/aunts/cousins were invited regardless if that number was ten times larger on my side than his. He did give her an ultimatum that was basically, we want nothing from you because we want this wedding to go our way, we appreciate anything you will do but it has to be with zero strings attached or we will not accept it. Ultimately FIL talked sense into MIL and they hosted the rehearsal which was lovely, but insisted on inviting some of their family friends to even out the guest list, since my family was so much larger than his.

&amp;#x200B;

Post wedding I’m told MIL was speaking negatively of myself and my family, particularly my mother. My bridesmaids showed me FB messages she sent them doing so. I figured it’s in the past and DH and I were moving to the opposite coast so why start stuff now? Well after the move (both families now on one coast and us on the other) she began saying unkind things about me to DH, innocent enough at first like “I feel like OP doesn’t like me, doesn’t want me in your home (she visited WAY TOO OFTEN so she technically wasn’t wrong), OP shows me how much she cares because she hasn’t cleaned well enough for my visit”, etc. She’d say it all to DH and then say, “but don’t tell OP”. Really ramped up when I became pregnant. Announced the pregnancy on FB at 11 weeks before I’d even told my friends or extended family despite being told not to. She started claiming we preferred my family over hers and were trying to exclude her family from our kids’ lives. We returned to the original coast and this only became more frequent. You’d think you’d be happy to have your son and grandkids back nearby!

&amp;#x200B;

After our return to original coast, she really began her tirade against my family. Saying we preferred them because they had money and nice things (again, my parents are teachers, and ILs own a vacation property and only drive new cars, the irony is ridiculous), saying that my family was trying to poison my DH, myself, and our children against her and FIL… crazy stuff. After much back and forth with DH, him constantly defending her and me telling him that this isn’t normal - he finally saw the light. He was telling me how she understood and was going to change and five minutes later she sent him a hateful email just doubling down on her accusations and explaining that he really shouldn’t be telling me all of this, and just generally inserting herself into our marriage.

&amp;#x200B;

We tell MIL no contact until you’ve been in therapy and made progress (FIL and BIL were welcome and still invited to things) and the next time we’ll talk to you is in a therapy session. After a few months we go to the session. We do a few and I feel she’s just justifying “her feelings” as the reason she did things and she really never admitted that they were wrong - just kept saying “imagine how I must feel”. But her feelings just made no sense - she kept saying she felt my parents were pushing them away, pushing us away from them (ILs), but there was no truth to any of that, and it certainly didn’t excuse the lies she told about me and my family. I ended up delivering my son and stupidly allowed them to come visit and pretty much put it behind us. I told my husband I wasn’t happy, that she never acknowledged wrongdoing or remorse, and certainly she never apologized, but he said that “they’re not an apologizing family” and that I should be able to move forward with change in behavior as evidence enough.

&amp;#x200B;

Well it’s been over a year and I don’t think I’m over it. Her behavior has improved, but we also pretty much grey rock and keep relatively low contact. I totally dropped the rope and don’t really communicate outside of happy birthday texts and the like, though I don’t ignore any time they do reach out. BIL has got himself a lovely girlfriend, and the times I have seen MIL, she tries to gossip and basically says the same things about the new girlfriend and girlfriend’s family that she used to say about mine! I totally grey rock and change the subject but it’s really been making me think that she hasn’t changed at all, she’s just been hiding her behavior because she knows if she doesn’t she won’t be allowed access to the grandkids.

&amp;#x200B;

Summer is approaching and the ILs keep asking when we’ll be going to their vacation property. They pretty much live up there June-September, and honestly I think they expect us to visit at the frequency of every other week. We’ll plan to go up maybe twice, for one-two nights each visit, probably max. And that’s only because the kids love it and my husband is attached to the place. I am VERY uncomfortable on these visits because the camp is SMALL. Two bedrooms, one bath, and not even proper walls so you can hear literally EVERYBODY snoring. My kids are light sleepers and they get exhausted due to the late nights and early mornings and lack of naps. I have nowhere to escape. DH has offered to go up alone with the kids, but I actually fear the kids being there without me. It’s on a lake and either of my kids could easily wander down to the water if you look away for a second, and neither are swimmers yet. It’s also right off a highway on the other side. I know DH likes to visit with his brother and have a few beers while fishing or whatnot, so I worry if I am not there and DH is off with his brother that the ILs won’t be responsible enough to look after the kids themselves. DH says he trusts them and that should be good enough for me. But FIL also has health problems he hasn’t addressed, he falls asleep all the time and has passed out a few times; MIL is way too into FB and her phone and gets distracted and I’ve found my son climbing stairs 15 feet away from her when he was 8 months old and she was just staring at her phone. MIL begs for alone time with the grandkids but the thought makes my mom alarm bells ring.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I’m asking for help is because I’d love some advice - should I just let everything she did to me in the past go? It’s true we all did therapy, it’s true that she has either stopped with the gossip and lies or at least kept them away from us. Her behavior has been modified to what we asked for during therapy. But I’m still mad, I still don’t trust her, and frankly I don’t love being around her, yet I really don’t feel safe with her around my kids without me there. Am I being crazy? Should I just let DH take the kids up to the camp and stay home? My kids are special needs and require lots of care and attention and I could use a day or two to myself but I think I’d worry the whole time. And I wouldn’t put it past her to put negative thoughts/words into my kids ears or into DH’s ear with me not around. It bothers him that I don’t trust his family. This is one of the ONLY things we argue about. Probably THE ONLY thing we argue about because the other difficult discussions we have are around money, we sometimes struggle but at least we are on the same page.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh also, I did individual therapy years ago and discussed some of my MILs habits and such with my therapist, she sounded horrified and asked why I continued to let her in my life. This was prior to family therapy with MIL but sometimes I wished I just dropped the rope then!",JUSTNOMIL
"My MIL, Emotionally Stunted Emma (ESE), has been put in an indefinite time out. You can read my post history for the full story but basically DH and I tried to do counseling with ESE to clear up our past issues. It was difficult just to get ESE to attend one session and she quit saying it was too painful for her. She completely blamed me for all of our conflicts and tried to get DH to have a relationship with her ""outside of his marriage"". Then ESE tried to rug sweep everything and asked me to planned a family vacation next year that DH and I already said we wouldn't attend. We decided to put ESE in an indefinite time out and told her we need apologies and acknowledgements of her actions before we would communicate further. 

&amp;#x200B;

ESE didn't acknowledge the message we sent her and I didn't expect her to. After that she sent a weird message to DH saying she's sending him a ""message of encouragement"", that she's proud of him and he makes a difference in what he does everyday at work. 

&amp;#x200B;

We passed Mother's day and ESE's birthday and obviously didn't contact her but also didn't hear from her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Next was my birthday, a week after ESE's. DH and I both have her blocked on social media but ESE managed to wish me a happy birthday on my mom's post. Not sure why she bothered because I had no idea until my sister told me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then DH's birthday, a week after mine. ESE mails him a birthday card. It's simple, the card has a prewritten message about love and support, and she wrote ""Love you always, ESE &amp; SFIL"". 

&amp;#x200B;

We have done other unofficial breaks from ESE before and she doesn't really love bomb. This is usually her tactic, small gestures that seem extremely inadequate in my opinion but evoke a strong emotional response from DH. He told me it makes him feel sad because he knows she's in pain and is also sad. This sounds cruel but I find it really pathetic and I think that's what ESE is trying to do. I think she's trying to look and act pathetic so her sons feel bad for her.  

&amp;#x200B;

Whatever, she's not going to get a response from us for a long time. I'm going to try to get DH to flesh out his feelings related to mom more during our next counseling session.",JUSTNOMIL
"I have posted this week about my in laws and their demands. They have truly topped themselves. 

After visiting Saturday, and pulling guilt trips and tears with my DH, they had the gall to send an email yesterday that was unbelievable to me. They told my DH he's a bad communicator while saying they love him. They blamed him for the status about relationships while refusing to accept any responsibility. 

I'm so fucking done. They insult us, belittle us, and blame us while also saying we should do activities as favor for them. 

I need boundaries to stay sane. I'm not sure I've been honest with this sub or myself. I'm happy with my husband, but when his family gets in our lives it seriously pushes me off the edge. My depression and suicidal tendencies get triggered by them. Their attitude completely overwhelms me and plays on my fears of worthlessness and fear of disappointment.

Here are my boundaries. Can you all help me calibrate my sanity? Are these boundaries appropriate? My fear is that these do harm and cause pain. I'm lost and I need validation. I don't want to search for it from DH because his family has just painfully accused him of abandoning his family. 

1. Ability to end an interaction

2. Do not enter my bedroom or the room I am staying in

3. No discussion on personal subjects that are personal to me. They include: my religious convictions, my family, potential for children, my job satisfaction and my point of view on politics. If this happens, I will leave the room.

4. No belittling my accomplishments, specifically my education and job status. If this happens, I will leave the room.

5. No belittling my ability to be a spouse and a wife. If this happens, I will leave the room.

6. Ability to take time out as needed, unquestioningly and without judgement, to reduce anxiety and limit depressive episodes. 

Just asking. Are these appropriate?",JUSTNOMIL
"Ive been having a lot of issues affording to pay for Drs appointments and my medications that I need now that my insurance was cut off after my son died. My darling MIL takes the same meds as I do and does not even use them. The other day DH went to the ILs house to do their brakes quick and he asked if she had a few of the meds I needed since I cant afford to get a refill til next week, and the meds wont be in stock til then. No big deal right? Yeah. Right...

She says she doesnt have any and shes been fighting with her doctor for a refill herself cuz apparently he switched her meds on her and the new ones did not work. Ok. fine whatever Ill deal.

Ive been massively sick and in and out of the ER without my meds to help me so Ive been miserable. This morning MIL calls and leaves another voicemail for DH and Im freaking dumb struck at how fucked she is using my shitty health for her own gain knowing I have no choice but to agree.

MIL: Hey, I found about 15 of those laying around on my counter (Lies cuz her counter was bare when we were there.) and I know Cheshire needs them, But I need to ask for $150 for them so I can pay dads fine cuz we have court on X Date or theyre throwing him in jail for Xdays. Lmk. LOVEEEE YOUUUU""

So he tells my mom about the voicemail and she says she can give them 100 so i can feel a little better until I get my check and can pay for my meds. I feel like shit having her do that. So DH calls and she agrees thats enough and shes gonna give me the 15. We go up there and they trade but its not til we leave that he realizes she didnt give us all of what she agreed to. Now hes pissed off and shes using the excuse we didnt give her enough money for all of them. Thanks MIL. I can literally die without my medications but all you care about is money.",JUSTNOMIL
"Edited to make it easier to read. Sorry for any confusion!

I went out to lunch with my family today. It was for shits and giggles, I guess. My mom was talking to me and my relative(L) and she pulls out her phone and shows us a picture of our relative.

Before I get into this, I’d like to say that this relative(S) has been working her fucking ass off these past four years of high school and has been on honor roll the whole time. Anything below a B causes her to have breakdowns, and just B’s themselves make her incredibly upset. She’s about to graduate and is probably very stressed with finals. She lost weight before but has gained it back, seeing it in the picture.

Honestly, I didn’t notice anything (was looking at her hat) until my mom said, “She put on weight”. I wasn’t listening and asked her to repeat it but L cut in and said, “She said that S got fat again”. I was horrified. I looked at the picture again, shrugged, and said, “Okay, and what? She’s probably very stressed with school. Even then, who cares?” My mom stuttered and took her phone back and my relative got quiet.

So, I decided to be a shithead.

My dad hates not being told things that are going on, especially concerning our house and the family (me, mom, brother, Mr. Snuggles).  I knew for a fact that neither my mom nor L told my dad that L’s sister is flying in this week. I decided to play dumb and I asked L, “Hey, does my dad know your sister is flying in?” and she said she didn’t know, so I looked my dad in the eye and asked, “Did you know ____ is flying in?”

The table went quiet. My dad’s eyes got big and were full of surprise and anger. My mom looked at me then back at her phone. He asked when, and I looked at L and mom for them to answer. He was PISSED. He was asking them questions and trying not to lose his shit, they were freaking out trying to avoid being caught in their lie, and I was sitting there sipping my water scrolling through Reddit. 

Was it immature? Sure. Do I care? Not one bit.

I definitely could have handled it better by asking him privately, but when the two people that are hiding secrets from him are sitting with us and have all the answers, why not make use of the opportunity? Right?

My dad deserves to know what’s going on. Hiding shit from him doesn’t do anything but cause problems in the future. Besides, I know my mom and L would have been bitter towards me the whole day had I told my dad privately and would have treated me like shit. Since I did it with my dad in front of them, they know that if they treat me poorly, my dad will know why, and they’ll have to deal with my dad yelling at them for treating me like shit for trying to be honest.

He knows I did it to be a shithead but he’s grateful.

Not gonna lie, I was pretty mad about my mom’s comment about S gaining weight. It happens. We need to stop shaming people for these things and instead offer support to them. Yeah, she gained weight, but look at what cost: Honor roll. Good universities. Good grades. Then again, I’m a bit of an optimist, so that’s probably why I think like that.

I’m also not an asshole.",JUSTNOMIL
"My MIL is the most controlling, petty, ridiculous woman i have ever had the misfortune of meeting . Her and I have been through a fair share of issues which stem from her need to control and me not giving her what she wants. Yesterday we were on the phone talking about my 9 month old son (first grandchild) and she felt the need to tell me ....and i quote ""we let you name the boy but we get to name the girl."" what the actual F**k????? First off im not even pregnant. Second of all the lack of respect for boundries  never ceases to amaze me. I wish she would f**k off into oblivion.",JUSTNOMIL
"My mom has always been overbearing. Shes a classic Asian helicopter mom, and it never got better as I got older. I've struggled with the FOG since I realized  it existed. And I WANT to leave home - I lived at home through college and now that I'm earning money, I can leave. But it's hard, and I'm scared. I know plenty of people have left home with less and were less prepared but I'm scared of how she'll react, even though I'll be gone, and I'm scared for myself.

My SO has been my best friend since we started college (24 now), and hes always called out my mom for what she is, and encouraged me to get my life together so I can leave. He finally got fed up last night, and ultimately decided to take a break, although it very narrowly wasn't a full breakup. This is all over him asking me to move in with him; we agreed a while ago to look for a two bedroom in our city so that we could both have our own space, for personal and school purposes, save money, and still see each other every day. He was offered the opportunity for one this past week, in the same building as his aunt, nice neighborhood, safe, and it's a two bedroom priced very well for our city. Even after our fight last night, the invitation is still extended, and I want to take it, for my own sanity, to live my life. This is the SECOND relationship shes ruined, or almost ruined. My first ex broke up with me because of her too. If I lose this one over her, I will never forgive myself. I just need to prepare myself and find the motivation within myself to stop putting what she thinks over all else. I'm absolutely devastated and a mess and I want to cry.

EDIT: I just wanted to say, as I continue to reply to comments, that I truly appreciate everyones support - I'm reading everyones hard truths and kind words, and I cant thank you enough. My boyfriend and I patched things up and I told him I would move in with him. He let me know, firmly, that once I committed, I couldnt back out. But like I said above, its an ideal first home - we can afford it, we're close to family and our friends, the landlord is confirmed not a dick, we're near the supermarket, laundry, public transportation, everything we need, and its the safest part of the borough. His aunt lives basically next door and showed him the apartment last night, and he said it was amazing, eat in kitchen, large living room, and two decent sized bedrooms, which we specifically want so we have places to retreat to and study in (we're both pursuing post grad courses and programs, and also enjoy our space, lol). I'm putting off speaking to my parents until after we get a move in date, which we're hoping will be pushed off a few months so we can work on our savings. 

I also wanted to talk about my mom a little more; my parents adopted me as a baby, and I'm the only child. My parents got me later in life; they met and got married in their mid-30s, and got me in their early 40s; theyre young senior citizens now. My mom in particular is a bit unhinged; she has her moments of clarity and love bombing, then the next minute or day its stretches of anger and depression where her behavior is totally unpredictable and she will lose her shit over something small or nonexistent. My dad is JustYes, for the most part, despite being an enabler of her behavior a lot of the time. He puts up with all of this because he wants to avoid her getting angry over nothing. They both support me being independent - they aren't exactly holding me hostage but the sequence of events and my moms need for control has led me to become cowed by her, just like my dad. I wasn't allowed to hold a job in college after a certain point, or hang out with friends or my first ex, or join clubs, because i had to focus in school. I didnt fight back against this sort of thing because i wasn't paying for my schooling, and they were right - my grades had dropped significantly due to a traumatic event, and eventually, I was forced by her to stop attending therapy for that and other mental issues. I had zero autonomy over my life. So I really needed this reality check when I got into that fight with my boyfriend - I know, logically, this situation WILL work out for me and I NEED to do it for myself before I die in this apartment, but I can't even comprehend how to go about it. Its disorienting!! But I feel a motivation that I havent really felt before, and I'm working on shining up my spine :) Love you guys!

Edit 2 electric boogaloo lol: the landlord gave us a move in date of August 1st; I think I'm putting my deposit down this weekend after we view the place. Still replying to comments - thanks again to everyone!",JUSTNOMIL
"Background- my MIL is very toxic and abusive. I've been with my husband for 8 years and she always treated me as if I were some fly-by-night girl he brought home. She would randomly call him up and scream at him for various things (usually made up stuff), but two weeks later acted like the fight never happened. The final straw came when she spent the last three weeks before our wedding trying to ruin it. There was a huge blow out where she told him he was ""no longer her son"" among other things. My husband decided that he would be going NC, and since we were living in an apartment his parents owned they understandably kicked us out. We decided to move 1000mi away and not disclose our address or new phone numbers to anyone in his family. My husband got rid of all his social media and I blocked most if his family off of mine, after we found out she had been logging into his uncle's Facebook to keep track of us (AIL's husband). We found out because she sent a message from the man's Facebook accusing my husband of being a horrible son and reiterating that she was disowning him two days after the man had died. I then blocked the rest if his family...

Except for his aunt, my MIL's twin sister.  Aunt In Law was actually the only one in his family that has been super supportive of us. He felt bad blocking her because she had honestly never done anything bad to us, unlike a lot of his other family members. I agreed to keep her on my friends because she was so different from the rest if his family. Then I kept her because I felt bad that her husband had just died, even though she started sending messages saying his mom was wishing him a merry Christmas,  happy birthday, etc. When my husband told her that he wanted NC from his mom she said she totally understood why asked if she could still talk to us. He agreed.

However,  recently I have been getting messages from her that don't sound like she wrote them. They sound a lot like messages his mother would write, seemingly trying to check up on my husband. (For example, AIL would always ask how WE were doing, the questionable ones only ask how my husband is doing) Around Easter we got a ""Happy Easter"" message 3 weeks beforehand that sounded like MIL fishing for info, and then another  ""Happy Easter"" on the day that sounded like his aunt. I have resorted to only responding to messages coming from AIL Facebook with comments on the weather and nothing else because I'm not sure who is seeing it and I am uncomfortable with my MIL knowing anything that is going on in our lives. I've become afraid to even update my Facebook because I don't know who will be seeing it. But I have no concrete PROOF that she is allowing my MIL to use her Facebook, so I feel like a jerk if I block her without it. But I would also like to use my Facebook again. I need someone outside of this to help me decide.",JUSTNOMIL
"The good news is I am getting married in 20 days. I have a good FMIL (sometimes a bit over attached to FDH) who is throwing a nice rehearsal dinner. I’m avoiding Bridezilla antics and keeping things chill. 

Cue E-Vill....my JNM who makes me have fantasies that I’m adopted. When I called to tell her we were engaged she spent half an hour making me feel like crap. No congratulations, just pure bitterness and venom. 

For the next year E-Vill works overtime to ignore my wedding. If it’s brought up she changes the subject. Social media postings are ignored. When it is acknowledged it’s minimized, mocked or greeted with disdain. FMIL has been the go to parental this whole time. 

Until E-Vill gets the invite for the rehearsal dinner three weeks ago. 

Now she is insisting on throwing a brunch the day of the wedding because ‘something should be done for the bride’s side of the family.’

ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? YOU HAVE HAD YOUR PHASERS SET FOR IGNORE FOR 15 MONTHS! Now that you see his mom is an active participant you are throwing an additional event at the last minute? 

I’m not dumb. Her narcissistic ass is doing this because she is concerned she will look like an asshole to his family. News flash. They’ve watched her behavior for the last year. They KNOW she’s an asshole. 

Please don’t let this woman fuck up my wedding. If I get blood on my dress from chasing her with a chainsaw, that would totally suck. But so help me God if she embarrasses my new family, I will end her.

Edit: Thought about the morning after but she is flying out to be a presenter at a Catholic Seminar.  Took the advice of letting her throw it but informing her that I will be too swamped to attend.  She can do her pretentious bullshit without me there as some verification that she is not the AOB (asshole of the bride).

"I got married yesterday and it was perfect and made me so so happy. However, my JNMIL said a few things as we were all lined up to walk down the aisle that made me go ""really?""

First, when she saw me in my dress for the first time, she says pretty sarcastically ""well, you look kinda nice."" 

Next, my maid of honor was speaking kinda loudly and my day of coordinator asked everyone to quiet down and JNMIL goes ""of course it's (MOH name). It's always been her. Y'know, we all thought MOH and D(ear)H would be the ones getting married"" seconds before walking her son down the aisle to marry me. She's been saying things like this about my MOH the whole time DH and I have been engaged. MOH and DH have been really good friends since kindergarten, but nothing more and MOH and I were best friends in high school. She introduced DH and I and I love her to death. 

I didn't hear this last comment luckily. I just heard about it from others after the wedding. Everything else was perfect though.

&amp;#x200B;

I see a lot of posts about sharing living arrangements with MIL, but my situation is a bit different.... When I met my partner 4 years ago, he had moved back into his mom's house. Originally, that was to give him somewhere affordable to stay while he was working on his masters thesis. My partner is an only child, and he and his mom are quite close. Living together worked well for them - he kept things to the cleaning standards that she wanted, and they ate meals together, went on diets together, and kept each other company. He always saw that living arrangement as temporary and was deeply embarrassed and ashamed that he wasn't supporting himself. MIL's husband (my partner's dad) died approximately 8 years ago, at a fairly young age, after a short fight with an aggressive brain cancer, and I think that drew them closer together as they coped with their grief. Anyways, shortly before I came along, MIL had the idea to give her son her full-size, very nice, fully-paid-for house - IF he paid for a 500sqft suite to be built in the backyard for MIL to live in. My partner had agreed to this, but it hadn't gotten any further than that. After my partner and I became serious, they told me about this housing plan. I was very nervous about this plan, because my family upbringing was rocky, and I learned not to rely on family and not to enter into financial arrangements with family. However, the house is very nice and way more than we could afford on our own, and if it worked, it could be nice to have family nearby. I also didn't want to cause turmoil as the new girlfriend by being the reason that this idea got cancelled. So I moved into my MIL's house with my partner after a year of dating, and plans began for the backyard suite.

&amp;#x200B;

It took almost 3 years for the suite to be finished, and in the meantime, MIL and I struggled to get along in the same house. She is a very loud person, who likes to talk AT my partner and I (her political opinions, what she did that day, what she had for lunch, all about her friends who we've never met). I am a quieter person who doesn't like to have to fight for conversation time, so I mostly try to politely listen. She rarely asks questions about my partner, and she almost never asks questions about me or my life, and when she does ask, she is a terrible listener (will start reading something on her cellphone and interrupt us with something she reads). I find this quite rude, and it also really bothers my partner. On top of being annoyed, my introvert self just wants to run away and find some quiet space with less constant talking. She is very opinionated and quick to anger about something she sees on Facebook, so it gets stressful listening to her anger about Trump or her sisters, etc, etc. MIL also has a very high standard for cleaning, and tidyness and presentation is valued above almost everything else. She's one of those people whose bedroom looks like a hotel room, and who buys products because the packaging is nice. I try a little tiny bit, but I dress much more casually than she does (no makeup, very casual clothes, don't often style my hair), and my partner is like me. I have a hard time not judging her as superficial. She really struggled if we left our downstairs space messy (blankets unfolded on the couch, bed unmade, cup on the coffee table), and so she would come downstairs and make our bed and do our laundry. I was really not okay with this, so my partner talked to her and she begrudgingly stopped but would still occasionally have slip-ups. I was paying for all of the utilities/insurance for the house ($750/month), so in my mind, we were basically renters and had rights to our own space. She also occasionally threw things out of mine if I left them upstairs. To be fair, they were small things, but I found this really upsetting without asking me first, or at least moving them downstairs if she didn't like them. I would get upset and run to our bedroom and cry (I'm not a huge fan of conflict, and prefer to try to cool off and talk when I am less emotional). She would also move things around, like deciding that it was no longer winter, so putting our winter coats and boots away in places we'd never stored them without telling us, and then when we were trying to leave, we wouldn't know where our stuff was. She would also move our artwork and stuff around sometimes. I didn't feel comfortable that it was my home too, because I was lacking control. I have depression and anxiety (for which I take daily medication), and every day when I came home from work, I would feel so anxious when I came in the front door and my coats and shoes weren't there, or my 3 potted plants had all been moved into dark corners in new pots, or the kitchen cupboards were rearranged and now I couldn't find my food. I realize those are small things, but she tidied/rearranged almost every day, so it was very cumulative for me. While she was still living in the house, it was still HER home, so I didn't have a right to ask her not to rearrange the upstairs living areas. But I couldn't turn off my emotional response to it (which is my problem, not hers). I did try once to explain that I felt intimidated and uncomfortable speaking to her about my issues sometimes, and her response was a firm ""Um, NO. I have been MORE than accommodating with you moving in with your things. NO.""  And after that, I really didn't want to talk to her about issues ever!  She then started texting me reminders that I should do my laundry and clean off my dresser (""My son worked so hard to renovate that room, and it's a shame that you both can't enjoy it because of how messy your dresser is"" -- we BOTH renovated that room TOGETHER). And casually mentioning during dinner that ""You would feel much less stressed if you got rid of things and kept things more neat"". She bought me a chore organizer notepad. I told her, politely but firmly, that these suggestions by her were bringing me stress and making me upset, and were not having her desired outcome of ""being helpful"". We opened the christmas presents from her on christmas eve last year. She bought me some nice, considerate things, but she also bought me a book on ""How to Clean Your House"" and ""How to be more kind (she included a notebook with that one so I could record my progress). I cried myself to sleep because I was so offended that she would rather pester me about cleaning AT CHRISTMAS than consider my feelings. I emailed her thanking her for the gifts and saying how much I liked certain things, but that I really didn't appreciate the book about cleaning. She didn't respond to that section of the email. These issues extended to the yard and garden spaces. We both like to garden, but have extremely different tastes. She likes plants to look very formal and pruned and she doesn't like any leaves or debris anywhere. I am a biologist and would like to have a more sustainable, ecologically-friendly garden and lawn - I want to have leaves in the garden beds, and I don't want to spray everywhere like crazy for weeds (except for the extremely aggressive ones), and I don't want to spend a bunch of time pruning every shrub into a ball shape. Of course, we have butted heads over yard maintenance - she has weeded vegetables that I grew from seed because she thought they looked messy, and she has torn out some of my plants due to her excessive raking in the garden beds. She moves my potted plants around almost daily. It is upsetting (I am admittedly very attached to my plants), but I've tried to swallow it because it was HER house.

&amp;#x200B;

I knew that we were going to have issues with boundaries, and I have been so worried about this. I tried to address the issue 2 years ago by asking if we could all sit down and discuss what our expectations and priorities were for the new living arrangement, and see how we could come to understandings and compromises. I thought maybe we could try to figure out how each of us envisioned the new arrangement, and make sure we were all on the same page, and write down our agreements now while we are level-headed so that we can refer to them in times of conflict. I gave examples like ""We want to get a dog, and what if we let that dog go into the backyard sometimes - would that be okay with you?""  Up until then, MIL would just say ""I'm sure everything will be fine"" when we tried to have those conversations. Her response to our ""let's try to get on the same page now"" idea was ""This is ridiculous, I'm not signing some contract. If you guys think we need this, then this isn't the right arrangement for you"", and just walking away kind of chuckling.  I have been very worried about not having any gardening space to truly call my own. My partner and I tried to preempt that by asking MIL if she would be okay with us taking full gardening/lawncare control of the front yard, and her taking full gardening/lawncare control of the back yard. She didn't exactly formally agree to anything, but she did say that we could do whatever we wanted in the front yard.

&amp;#x200B;

Now she has finally moved into the backyard suite (she's been there for 2 months). Her clothes dryer isn't working, so she has been coming once a week to use ours (she asks and schedules a time, which is great). But while she is in our house, she tidies and rearranges decorations, and last time she did a load of my laundry and folded other laundry. My partner talked to her about it, and then I also texted her about it, to try to explain that it really makes me very anxious, and I know it sounds silly because she is being helpful, but I would really appreciate if she didn't do stuff like that. She replied that ""I'm sorry you have such a low opinion of me, I was doing it as an act of love"". I replied ""I know, and I don't mean this as a personal attack against you, but I'm asking you to find a different way to show that you care"". She never replied.

&amp;#x200B;

She has suggested a few times in the past month that she could mow the front yard for us, and we have kindly and politely expressed that we would really like to take care of it ourselves. Last week, she weeded in the front and mowed the grass, even though we had asked her not to. This caused a huge blow up. She said that she absolutely refuses to follow any ""rules"" like that, and that she is 50% owner of this property (she added my partner to the title 2 years ago), and the yard WILL be maintained to her standards. She announced that this arrangement was not working out and she was going to contact a realtor about selling everything. She said we had put way too many rules upon her  (""I can't even go into the house and fold fucking laundry"") and that she would never set foot in the main house again because we had made her feel so unwelcome because we asked her not to move stuff around. That she is 70 years old and demands to be treated with the respect that a 70 year old should be given. That she might as well rent the main house out to strangers for the little amount of time we spend with her (we see her every. single. day. We don't always spend a lot of time with her, but she asks my partner to do something or talk to her about something every day.  It is very common for him to wake up in the morning and already have a text from MIL (""Can you lend me an egg?  I don't feel like going to the store."")  And we spend time with her or have dinner with her at least 3 times a week.)  Anyways, then she stormed out and when she came back, my partner went to talk to her. He was so upset, he felt like he had failed everyone for trying to make this arrangement work, and he's under so much stress from it. After MIL saw him crying, she agreed to the terms. She sent me a text that said ""I love my son more than life itself, and it pains me to see him in pain. I will follow the rules"". I responded that I was sorry that we had made her feel less than valued and respected, and that I hoped in time we could develop a compromise that allows everyone to feel respected and considered. She never bothered to respond. I'm not saying that our stipulation of having complete control over the front yard is the greatest compromise, but I wish that she would try to compromise with us. She won't acknowledge the issues in any of her actions or opinions, and she never seems to think that she is at fault at all.

&amp;#x200B;

In summary:  My partner and I now live in MIL's former house. MIL put son on the title for the property (so now they are both on the title).  My partner and I paid to build a suite in the backyard for MIL (MIL's idea). My partner and I agreed to pay all utilities and expenses for both houses, and to handle all maintenance issues. My partner and I are stating that we want complete control over all the gardening and maintenance in the front yard, because gardening is very important to me, and MIL and I have very different gardening practices, so this is a way to avoid us butting heads constantly. We have given her full control of the backyard and she has designed and implemented a garden that is very much her style.  She thinks we are being excessively controlling, unreasonable, and disrespectful by asking/telling her not to touch the front yard. She is also very offended that we asked her not to move our stuff around in our house (despite us explaining many times that it really sets off my anxiety and makes me upset).   Are we being unfair and unreasonable??

"I've posted about my MIL here before. She typically acts like she's on your side and then gets swayed by someone else in their opinion and uses everything against you. She's a therapist and uses all her dirty tricks. I started calling her out for it but not everyone dares to. Also one mobile so sorry for the wrong format blahblah

So let's get started about ruggsweeping dramaqueen



I'll start at the engagement, SIL and her BF have been together for 20 years and finally her BF popped the question. MIL and FIL weren't consulted since her BF is sick of their bullshit and kind of and idiot. So immediately MIL was insulted, that FIL wasn't asked for his daughters hand. Like wtf, this isn't 1930's and they have been together for 20 years. Let them be happy.



Then SIL her now fiance, send out a text with the date of the wedding so everyone could plan a day off. But they hadn't talked to MIL and FIL yet. So MIl called up SIL to rant. Fiance picked up and she started cussing so he hung up promptly. Then she called again and SIL picked up. She yelled that SIL wasn't part of the family anymore and a disrespectful cunt. This fight went on for hours. Until MIL came to her senses and realized she had stepped out of the wedding herself and now can't make it all about her. 



Idk how, but she manipulated SIL in such a way that they made up and MIL can still come and do her part in the wedding. SIL and fiance are untraditional and have their own ceremony planned out. MIL got a part so she wouldn't make a drama. But ofcourse she is making a drama. So SIL was smart and took MIL to do everything up to the point MIL said she didn't need to be EVERYWHERE. While looking for a dress MIL dropped a bomb. She litterally said: ""yeah I thought no one cared about old me, I know everyone thinks I ruin everything, but your mom is still supposed to be at your wedding, it's the most important person AT your wedding."" 


I wasn't there but SIL told me that evening and MIL repeated it to me later on. SIL said she didn't know how to react, but I had time to harden my spine and spit back at her. ""No, wrong MIL, SIL and fiance are the most important people at the wedding. We should just be glad they are throwing a party."" This is where she got pissed at me but I had to go to work so just left. Later she tried to talk to me but I just ignored her.


Last Saturday was the bachelorette party and MIL was deeply disappointed she wasn't invited. I never knew you where supposed to invite your parents, I thought it was complete bullshit. I did read somewhere that you can go for high tea with parents and sisters to give them a bachelorette as well but honestly, who wants that?! With parents like MIL? No thank you! During the bachelorette, SIL let it show, MIL is ruining her wedding. MIL is even pissed I am helping SIL with the veil and make up, trying to insert herself into each and every situation. At first she wanted to be there with dressing up, ok I get that, but once she heard we had to be at the maid of honors house at 7 am on the wedding day she backed out. I was over the moon since I am helping with everything but nails. I told SIL we should count our lucky stars for it and she agreed, MIL would have been intruding without anything to do. Probably annoying us and making it last even longer.


The wedding is in 3 weeks. I live with the in laws until BF and I find our own place, I notice MIL getting more annoyed by each and everything she thinks she is supposed to be part of. Frustrations are getting vented towards BF and me. I already spoke to BF about this multiple times, they have gone to far in their bullshit multiple times, I do not want them at my wedding, I don't even want them to know where we are moving to. They are intrusive and entitled. BF agrees, when we are getting married, we are eloping. My sisters and his siblings can be witnesses if needed.",JUSTNOMIL
"TL;DR at the bottom.

So I have my very first therapy appointment in mid-July. The problem is my mother and enabling stepdad (I refer to him as Father and my deceased biological father Dad) want to visit for 4th of July. They mainly want to meet our 3 daughters( I live out of state, I moved to get away from them). My problem is that what I need therapy for is my childhood essentially. My mom was emotionally and verbally manipulative, bordering on (covert)abusive at times. I went no contact to vvvvvvlc for a while and then was kind of sucked back in thanks to my father. I have tried to have a ""hey this is what happened from my point of view  ( suicide claims for attention, pills, mental illness, DARVO, etc.)""  conversation with both my parents separately, to work it all out. But I was not prepared so my point did not come across and I received a rug sweeping general sorry you had feelings type of apology. 

My question is this...Do I tell them not to come right now? If so, do I tell them I'm working on things in therapy and that's why? If they do come how do I even pretend I'm not about to go to therapy due to unhealthy behavior I learned from them. Part of my hesitation is that my parents spent a lot of money on my now newborn twins while I was pregnant. All they know is that their nonapology was accepted and all my problems magically disappeared. But I did warn them it would take me a while to TENATIVELY build any type of relationship with them. They, of course, took this as we need to love bomb (which makes me uncomfortable) and ignore any protests and be a picture-perfect family. 

I don't want to step on any toes but I refuse to be uncomfortable. That's not a precedent I want to set for my girls. I might end up going back to vvvvvvvlc or no contact, but if I can learn how to have an actual conversation and voice concerns and issues. And they make the effort to change (which I'm not holding my breath for) then I would consider keeping this relationship. My husband is all for cutting contact, they really ramped up the toxic behavior and abuse when I met him because they saw their narc supply grow a spine for once in my life. I am leaning that way but again on the off chance talking maturely works  I don't want to premature set things on fire. 

TL;DR I'm starting therapy and JNparents coming to visit. Do I tell them to wait until therapy has made some progress? And how do I do that without pissing them off? 
PS. This will be cross-posted.",JUSTNOMIL
"I wanted to write this for anyone who needs it. 



I've been NC with my JNMom for nearly 2 years, with a year of VLC prior to that (see BB for stories if you want). Thanks to this community, I've been doing a lot of work on my normal meter, processing and accepting my childhood, and healing.     



Through my work's EAP, I started therapy. I've only had one session so far. My goal (because it's short term therapy) is to find ways to recognize triggers and change my reactions. Giggles, my JNMIL, hits a lot of triggers for me, and my patience is at zero with her. Thankfully DH has been understanding and letting me take the space I need.       



But what I wanted to say is, go to therapy. Even though this community is so helpful, so many write about how their JNs aren't nearly as bad as others. And a lot of us minimize or make light of things. It's a way of dealing. And it does work. But at my first session, I was giving the therapist a background rundown. The speed at which I could spew off and summarize things, I could see he was surprised. When I explained that from my earliest memories to NC, my JNMom regularly said ""I got pregnant with you because I thought you'd save the marriage, but you didn't"", the therapist was nearly in tears. He apologized. He was beyond taken back. And it made me step back as well. Because I was having my feelings validated. Because I've grown up with a JNMom who minimized and gaslighted everything, that the enormity of just how bad it is for a mother to say that to her child had never really sunk in.       



But there's also something to be said for having a professional tell you to step back. That boundaries are good. That limiting exposure is healthy. That you don't have to explain yourself, and simply repeat ""no thank you"" over and over until they get, or you leave. I know that advice is told all day, every day, here; but hearing it from someone on the outside is so validating. It gives a new sense of yes. And if I have to explain things to DH, now I can say my therapist said it, not some amazing and supportive internet strangers. 



So while my stories might not be as exciting as others, I shouldn't minimize them, because they did happen, and it's ok to be mad/hurt/sad about it.

"Hi, LTL, FTP. 

So my GM is pretty justno- she’s bitter, hypocritical, judgemental, enabling to my JNCousin and overall a pain in my ass. Most of the shit she says and does is BEC, with some exceptions, with today being one of them. **TW: Homophobia** (I don't know how to flair for that)

Before I continue, I’d like to express that I’m not looking for advice. I wouldn’t be able to apply any of it- my Mom and I live with her and my GP at the moment (hopefully that won’t be the case within the next few weeks, though!), and I don’t feel comfortable saying/doing anything out of fear of causing serious problems, IE potentially getting us kicked out. Trust me, I know exactly what I’d say if I could. 

Today, GM and I were at the kitchen table- she was reading the newest People magazine, and I was on my laptop with my headphones on. She came to an article about the new Elton John movie, and I kinda went ‘oh great, here we FUCKING go’. She’s really religious (Baptist, for what it’s worth) and is very openly homophobic, so I knew she’d likely have something to say about it. Instead, the following conversation ensued:

GM: Do you know the show ‘Arthur’?

Me, sweating even harder: Yeah.

GM: Well, his teacher recently married a man.

Me: I know.

GM: And apparently, a Methodist church down in (so-and-so location) threw a party for them, with cake and everything!

Me, who loves a good and accepting church: Aw, that’s nice!

GM: (CBF) Showing children a homosexual wedding is ‘nice’?!

Me: ...yeah? It’s just a wedding.

GM: (goes off on a rant about how the bible thinks gay people are an abomination, bla bla bla, if the bible says it’s wrong it’s wrong, bullshit bla bla bla): 

Me: Well, the bible also says that wearing two different materials (pointing to her outfit) is a sin, too.

GM, still CBF-ing: That was in the old testament. (sneering tone) Read the bible. Teaching children that homosexuality is okay will send them to hell!

Y’all. I almost fucking lost it on her. Last time I checked, the bible was over 2,000 years old, and teaching children love and acceptance doesn’t send them to hell. 

Me, Done With This: GM, it’s a children’s show. 

GM: (more bullshit that at this point I’d tuned out).

She left for the store shortly after this. Honestly, I’m hurt. I’m hurt, and I’m disgusted that she can be this hateful over a god damn cartoon. She's also said that all atheists go to hell, when she knows damn well I'm an atheist. 

All I can say at this point is that I can’t wait to get the fuck out of this damn house. I fucking hate her. 

Thanks for listening.",JUSTNOMIL
"Long time lurker, first time posting.  I’m extremely nervous. Constructive criticism would be nice.
I apologize in advance if this is to long.   

A little bit of backstory:
Hubby and I have been together for 10+ yrs. We met and dated way before we got married and had kids. Together as a unit we work very well. We together have, over the years, learned how to be the rock to our tiny family. 
Now I will admit that in the beginning it was a tough road. A lot of speed bumps. However, at one point we did realize that our issues weren’t our issues. Our fights had nothing to do with us. All our problems, our arguments, disagreements, etc. were because of my MIL. Always, unfortunately, planting that bad seed to get satisfaction/gratification to see that DH and I weren’t getting along. And then of course acting all innocent and caring and trying to wedge herself into our relationship with the typical “why are you fighting about? Is it something that I said or did because I never meant to offend”  Soooo you degrading your son calling him a worthless piece of fat sh*t and me a puta of a wife isn’t supposed to offend? 

Event that happened recently:
We were in the car and needed to make a quick stop at a craft store which just so happens to be right next to a baby supply store (I don’t like going into them yet. They give me anxiety) MIL makes a harmless comment (which in my head it was harmless) 

Following conversation happens:

MIL: oh there’s a baby store. I want to go in.

DH and I: (silence)

MIL: do you guys want to go? 

DH and I: no, we don’t want to go. 

MIL: WHY?

DH and I: we don't really feel like it. (didn't feel comfortable explaining her the detailed reason as it's none of her business. Also she would completely dismiss it as a bullshit reason)

Mind you MIL does this all the damn time. She does it to fish for someone else to chime and say oh I’ll take you and figuratively take her by the hand and take her. For some reason she can never do anything by herself. Not that she’s not capable. She’s more than capable she just needs someone to attach themselves to her hip in order for her to get anything done.

DH and I went in. Bought what needed to buy. He went ahead to the car and I went to the bathroom (as being 6 months preggers going to the bathroom frequently is not a surprise)
I get back to the car and I see him waving his arms around. I honestly thought he was on the phone. Unfortunately that was not the case as soon as I opened the door. DH and MIL were arguing. AGAIN! Anyone wanna guess why? because the response of we don't want to go isn't a valid response. MIL needed a more specific response. She needed to know the exact reason why we didn't want to go in. 
That started an hours long argument. Starting with the baby store. Complaining that she wanted to go into the store because she wanted to buy something for MY baby and I'm the reason why she doesn't buy anything because then it'll make me mad and I'll throw it away. OK! you could have gone in the store. NOBODY told you no you can't go into the store. You're a grown ass women NOT 12 who needs permission or be held by the hand or need supervision. Also we already knew what she wanted to buy. I have told MIL multiple times thank you and I appreciate it. However, I have told her repeatedly that I will not need what she would like to buy. I feel it's unnecessary. 

The argument covered a large array of things she's not ok with. Both DH and I stood up for ourselves. Which only enraged her more since it's my fault her son no longer respects her and only listens to me. NO thats not it!!! HE GREW A SPINE!!! I ended up in tears and DH couldn't console me in front of MIL because then that would make her go off even worse since to her the supportive relationship we have is NOT OK.

I'm so tired. Mentally, emotionally, which in turn makes me physically exhausted.",JUSTNOMIL
"Marked NAW but gentle advice/opinions welcome...

Soon to be SIL is from out of state and will be having a bridal shower in her hometown (3hrs away) as well as here (state my FOO lives &amp; soon-to-be SIL).  I had planned on driving myself down to help the MOH with random stuff on Saturday and stay with MOH overnight since the shower is on Sunday. Might visit a friend of mine in NYC on the way down or home, not sure yet. 

I inform Ikea Mom of this last week in passing and OF COURSE it is RIDICULOUS that I drive myself, reasons reasons, blah blah blah. Honestly, I just like being alone (road trips are a fun excuse for an interesting burn ride!), and want to be able to come and go as I please. I just left the conversation at you're entitled to your own opinion byeeee!

Today...

Ikea Mom: I spoke to SIL's mom and told her we'll be coming down with dad at XX time on Saturday and we're all staying over their house and they are SOOO excited!!

Me: .........

I didn't really engage, but also, wtf! I KNOW she intentionally set this up so I would feel obligated to stay where she commands and drive with her! I love my SIL's family, and would be okay with staying there, but also am SO FRUSTRATED she just feels the need to completely take over and control what I am doing. Ultimately, I am still sticking to the plans that I made, but I know as it gets closer she is going to become more and more obnoxious about the situation. 

People in these situations, do you just not address the ""new plans"" and go about your business? What are some good phrases when she starts in on me the week we're going?

Is this one where I give in to appease her since its not a huge deal?

"I’ve posted here a while ago, but I believe it was another account. At that time, I hadn’t met my MIL yet but she still kept saying mean stuff about me(even though she had never once spoke to me) to my then boyfriend. We’re married now although she doesn’t know it yet. I came to his country because it was the only option for us to close the distance considering he’s still studying and can’t move until next year.  I came to be an au pair here since he cannot provide for me to get a spouse visa. It’s been really hard. I miss my family, my friends and the warmth of my country. Not only the country itself, but our people. I hate it here. It’s cold, I don’t know anyone apart from my husband, there’s not much to see, barely any nature and his mom keeps being mean to me. Before I got this au pair job, I had another one in another country that I was supposed to go for a month, but the family texted and said they wouldn’t need me anymore. I was staying at his parent’s house. When it was almost time for to leave to the supposedly family(she didn’t know they had cancelled), she kept asking ALL THE TIME when I was leaving. That was so incredibly annoying and it made me feel unwelcome. I told him I’d be staying at an Airbnb and he told his mom about it. She said ok but that he couldn’t go with me because he has exams(even though with me, I really don’t disturb him whereas she calls him all the time to ask shit). She went with me anyway and she got mad for a while. I had forgotten one of my birth controls at his room but I had enough with me. She called him and told him that that was my plan b, get pregnant and trap him. She also mentioned some other girl with the same nationality as me who got a European passport through marriage and dumped the guy right after. First of all, I can’t even apply for a spouse visa, people!!! How the hell does she think I’d get a passport?(I’d have to stay 5 years in this country which I’m not even willing to because I hate it.) It’s been hard. It wasn’t easy leaving everything for him to get here and be accused of shit. She also told him I was annoying for asking what they were saying at the table often but since I don’t speak their language, otherwise I’d just sit there, eat and leave.

"Alright you guys, I’ve legitimately been stalking the ever living hell out of this sub since I started dating my husband and first met my now-MIL around 4 years ago. Your stories have gotten me through some ROUGH times. I think it’s about time for me to make an account and start posting.

A short highlight reel to get us all up to speed:


1) MIL was emotionally abusive to her children growing up. Classic case of narcissism, world revolved around her and the rest of the family could play along or face the consequences. You know the drill. 


2) Unsurprisingly, her husband promptly divorced her the moment the youngest kid left for college. Sadly for him, she still dug those claws in deep enough to manipulate him into literally moving across the street from her. The man still goes over almost daily to do laundry, take out the trash, or support her emotionally through her latest invented health crisis.


3) This is where the fun begins. MIL insists that she has about 800 serious illnesses and will gladly remind you that she could just about die any day from one of them, mostly when she senses she’s not getting her way. These include but are not limited to a heart condition, seizures (more on those next), Crohn’s disease, kidney disease, migraines, PTSD, and a rotating cast of allergies and communicable illnesses.


4) The seizures. I will gladly take this back and apologize profusely the moment I see any proof that they’re real, but I’m telling you - as someone who has actually had goddamned seizures - they are not. They tend to come around mostly when a) she’s not getting her way and b) emotional manipulation isn’t cutting it. She favors staging them at just the right moment when she’ll be the absolute center of attention and can safely collapse her entire body weight onto the nearest innocent bystander, all while babbling gibberish and loudly sobbing. She usually feels better after a few minutes of being sufficiently fawned over. 
To be clear, no doctor has ever diagnosed her with a seizure disorder, and she apparently is 100% confident that one of these pesky seizures will not pop up while she’s behind the wheel as she drives every day. In fact, as far as I know, the only condition she’s ever been formally diagnosed with was borderline personality disorder. She went and got a new doctor after that one.


5) She insists that because of her various health conditions she can only eat eggs, white bread (Wonder brand to be exact), Saltine crackers, and bananas. To my knowledge, she has eaten only these four foods, for three meals a day, for the past 10 or more years. I shit you not, this woman has not eaten a colored food in over a decade.


6) She claims to be allergic to grass, dust, pet hair, dander, and most cleaning products. She will not walk on grass, dirt, or carpeting, and absolutely refuses to use any sink, toilet, tub, or shower that has not been cleaned with her specific brand of products.


7) While she should have been nearing the point of retirement now, she apparently forgot to even start a retirement account (oops) and has none. She was previously working about 20 hours a week, but that busy schedule was too strenuous for our dainty queen and she conned the state into putting her on disability earlier this year. She continues to live alone in a 2500 sq ft house that she refuses to give up, despite the fact that the mortgage payment is quickly dwindling her savings account to zero. She apparently expects her children to completely support her in her old age; thankfully my husband and I discussed this before getting married and have decided it is totally out of the question.


8) The most intrusive of these is her severe emotional attachment to my husband. When he was younger he seems to have been the most susceptible to the emotional abuse. He was usually the one who took care of her physically and emotionally. I have to hand it to him, it’s taken years of practice and therapy but he has made a ton of progress. He really sets boundaries now and does a great job of shielding me from the worst of it. But nobody’s perfect, there are still times when he falls through, and this JNMIL is not ready to give up the fight. She enjoys flexing whenever she can. For example, if he’s standing with his arm around me, she’ll come over and try to get him doing the same to her from the other side. Weirdly over affectionate things that just aren’t quite appropriate with her adult son.


Anyway, I’ve got a whole list on my phone of stories to tell and I’m sure new ones will unfold (although I’m currently taking a leave of absence from visits as it was getting far too stressful to spend time with her). I’ll be back again soon, I am just dying to get these stories out there!",JUSTNOMIL

cw: allusions to emotional and physical abuse, hoarding 

My husband and I eloped last month so they have no idea we’re married, just saying that ahead of time. 

So my husband and I live with his parents. My MIL is a narcissistic hoarder with an aggressive drinking problem and has a long history of abusing my husband, my FIL is an enabler, and my husband still lives at home because he’s essentially the only thing keeping the family stable. My MIL, at the time I had moved in, had stolen and taken control of my husband’s dogs—one is a husky that is crated outside 22 hours a day, the other is a small dog that she had preferred to the husky so she kept it locked in her room. She feeds the dogs cooked chicken bones, expired human food (her primary hoard is food) and when my husband would want to see them, she’d lock her bedroom door and scream at him to go away while calling him a cocksucker and other vile names. 

After a long talk with my husband about how her behavior was not okay and how she was abusing and neglecting the dogs, he decided to do something about it. He took back the small dog, and is in the process of rehoming the husky with his best friend until we can get a permanent residence of our own. My MIL convinced herself I stole “her dog” out of spite and has launched an entire campaign against me/keeps doing weird shit. 

Ever since she saw my engagement ring (opal with moissanite) she’s been stockpiling on opal jewelry and bragging about it/showing it off to me before sneaking away, insinuating it’s prettier than my engagement ring. She will call my husband 30 times a day while he’s at work saying I’m neglecting our dog and that she took better care of him, and will sneak him foods he can’t eat under the crack of our bedroom door. She often digs through the trash when I cook with bones of any kind, takes the bones and hides them in her bathroom to try to feed to the husky and taunts me with it. 

My FIL literally will not speak to me at all because of her and if I say hi to him, he ignores me. If he needs to ask me something or whatever (he noticed the other day that I had a small oil leak on my car, for example) he will call or approach my husband and run it by him. 

She’s legit attempted to break into our room while we aren’t home to steal the dog. 

She bought a $1000 dachshund puppy with the same nose and eye coloring as my husband’s dog and frequently tries to come into our room saying the puppy is too annoying, and she’ll give us him and $1,000 for my husband’s dog. When we take the dog out of the room she comes running out to put on this display of being overly attentive to him—last night I was holding him in my arms because he was freaking out over fireworks in the neighborhood and she came over to me and hugged/nuzzled the dog FIVE TIMES while saying “I’m your real mama and I love you very much”

So last night, around 12, she starts knocking on our door telling my husband he takes shit care of his dogs and the husky is suffering because of him or some crazy shit (she will literally start screaming and throwing things if he goes near the husky) and that the small dog is “her property”. They started fighting and I’ve been cooped up in the room all day because she’s been stomping around the house screaming and throwing shit around/slamming doors. 

How do I survive this fucking woman?! I’m not one to ever use the word hate or wish death on people but I fucking HATE her and I’m counting the days until her drinking does her in.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi, long time lurker - new poster. I’m definitely nervous to post this but I just need some advice. I feel I should give some background, I’m 17(f) (soon to be 18) and graduating from high school in a few days. 

My mom 39(f) has had a problem with hard drugs since before I was born, and has used so much that she doesn’t remember how she treated me as a child. She has been clean for 2 years now and is in the 12 step program. 

When I was growing up, my mom, her husband (my step-father), and his two children used to mentally and emotionally abuse me, with occasional physical abuse. I would be yelled at or made fun of for things that weren’t my fault and I would be in trouble for it, longer than anyone else normally would. I also have two half-brothers from my stepfather, one is 11 and one is deceased. 

But I guess to where I’m feeling crazy — we got into a fight and my mind keeps going back and forth on how to move forward.

On a weekend trip, we had a massive fight and she was upset with me for not personally inviting her to go senior ball dress shopping (I typically go with my paternal grandmother). When we had the conversation I said, “I’m going to go dress shopping on this day at this time.” and she said okay and seemed uninterested. I said that she should’ve told me if she wanted to come, I was under the impression that she didn’t. But she said she didn’t want to “encroach on our time together” and if I wanted her there I would’ve invited her. 

Throughout this fight she kept sprinkling in this idea that I hadn’t forgiven her for her past despite me saying repeatedly that I had. I said that I still have resentment about the situation (the way I was treated affects plenty things about me/the way I interact with people to this day) but I have forgiven her because I believed she had changed and was a different person. (This fight has been making me question if she has changed her ways.) Her response was that if I had *truly* forgiven then I wouldn’t have any anger about any part of the situation between her, my ex-stepfather, or ex-stepsisters. She believes this because of her principles from being in the program. I believe that I am allowed to feel however I want about what happened to me and that my feelings are valid. (thanks therapy!)

Maybe this is all petty stuff but I’ve spent the last week incredibly confused and debating how much contact I want with her. I can’t not have her at my graduation but at the same time I don’t think I want to be near someone who expects me/my feelings to bend to her concept of them. 

This is all just really confusing and I’d like some advice please.",JUSTNOMIL
"Ok so I've posted a little here and there but deleted it. I think I should start at the beginning for others to understand. Fdh is the oldest of three, Justnosil and mostlynobil. He has played daddy for his younger siblings. His mom worked and couldn't give an f about anyone. His dad was on drugs 24/7. Mom worked steady job ffil sold drugs when needed. Fdh would cook, clean, change diapers, and manage his diabetes by the time he was in kindergarten. Ffil refused to care for bil as everyone knew it wasn't his child. Fdh was with mom during affair (in another room of course) so he knows the trith bit doesn't talk about it. FMil refused/refuses to acknowledge this and younger siblings believe her. 
FFil passed away to make a long story short FMil was sick of him. He was sick and blind due to him not caring or trying to manage his diabetes. So she picked the dogs over him (?)I know it's a lot to live with but the dogs really(she doesn't even try to take/took care of them. He was sent to live with his mom with his drug binges. His mom took money and he had an infection and by the time he was at the hospital he was crashing and being revived multiple times. 
FMil couldn't sign the papers to take the life support off. Fdh was 18 and had to do it. He planned the funeral and creamation. He dropped out of college to support the family. He did eveything he could for them. 
FMil and FSil resent him for ""killing"" FFil. It comes out as a means to manipulate to control him. He is a surrogate husband/father in everyway except sexually. I'm dealing with a monstrous situation of us vs me, they set it up at every given opportunity. Counstantly crossing boundaries that any sane human would never dare to venture.",JUSTNOMIL
"I’ve posted once before, so I guess this is just a continuation of writing down my trying and tedious relationship with MIL. Quick side note- I’m due to have a baby in a week, so I’m probably overly emotional anyway. 

Since my last post my MIL babysat once from 8a-3p so D(ear)H and I could take a class at the hospital. During that time, MIL didn’t feed my daughter (elementary/grade school aged) any real food the entire time, she just let her eat a box of chocolate chip muffins. We recently got a puppy and MIL didn’t supervise my daughter cleaning up after the puppy, and a huge mess was left behind. I told daughter in front of MIL that she couldn’t take any more pics today with her instant camera (the kind that prints the pics right away), and even made a comment to MIL about how expensive the film is. MIL didn’t stop daughter from using an entire roll of film, while daughter was sitting at the dining room table directly in front of MIL (she is in some pics).  When we got home at 3, MIL said daughter was at the neighbor’s house and had been since 1, and she didn’t know what daughter was doing or when she would be back. Great, thanks.

After MIL left I told DH that since she didn’t actually “watch” my daughter, she wouldn’t be babysitting again. Thankfully he agreed that she was absolutely no help and he wouldn’t be asking her again. I plan to remind him of that the moment he suggests she watch the baby in the future. MIL treats my daughter like a teen or something, and it really bothers me because her other grandkids are preschool age and she sure as heck wouldn’t let them walk across the room without involving herself in it. 

MIL/SIL/BIL/their kids all showed up unannounced at 5p the next weekend for a “surprise” baby shower. They brought dessert and clearly expected dinner. I was napping on the couch when I awoke to them all coming inside.  Normally I wouldn’t have made them any food but I was super hungry and my kiddo asked for spaghetti, so I just made a big batch. They ate the food then gave DH gifts and huddled around him ensuring that he would personally open the gifts. He asked me if I wanted to open one and I started to say no thanks (from across the room), but MIL cut me off saying these were more for him anyway. What really pissed me off is they badgered me to make a registry (I didn’t have a baby shower) and had me resend them the link to it multiple times over two months... then they didn’t even get anything from it. Just stuff that we didn’t need or want. 

Mother’s Day rolls around and I’m very sad and keep to myself, since I lost my mom two years ago to breast cancer. MIL texts me a stupid picture of her face saying “Happy Mother’s Day, love Mom”. That really upset me. She’s honestly the age of my grandmother and I could never see her as a mother. 

Yesterday she stopped by after giving an hour’s heads up. I didn’t want to fight it so whatever. She shows up, asks me for a glass of water while I am filling my own glass, and while I’m getting it for her she takes my seat! Literally we are the only people in the room and she takes the 9 month pregnant lady’s chair. I said nothing because I’m always feeling like I’m on the edge of a breakdown with her. We move outside to grill out with DH, and I open the bag of chips that has been sitting in front of us for 5 minutes. She immediately stops eating her food and asks me for the chips, before I even take one out of the bag. DH turned around and I rolled my eyes, he gave me a knowing look and said something like, “Jeez mom you could wait a second”, then gave her a handful of chips on her plate and handed the bag back to me. She left her dirty dishes on the patio table and went inside when she was done. 

I am DREADING her visiting when I have the baby. She stresses me out and has made comments before about how she will be “sitting in the chair by the window, rocking the baby all summer.” I just gave her a blank face and didn’t acknowledge it in the moment. She will be lucky to hold this baby for more than five minutes at any given time, TBH. The thought of her treating new baby so well and my daughter as less than so makes me livid. DH thinks I’m overreacting and making up worst case scenarios. He also pointed out that she is the only grandmother baby will have and it both hurt and made sense to me that he was trying to protect their relationship. 

I don’t know what else to say, at the end of the day I just miss my (just yes) mom.",JUSTNOMIL
"MIL made a Fb post about DD (not unusual, I don't mind bc she never posts pictures or usually even uses her name, she's her only grandchild so everyone knows who she's talking about) but... It's just lies. She constantly says that DD said a new word when she hasn't. This time it was that she named a toy when she was just making the sound the toy makes. Before she's also said that DD hated a certain song that we know for a fact she loves, because MIL disliked it for being repetitive (like most kids songs)

But. This is what really got under my skin. She started it off like ""Miss Grand baby ([DW's] little girl)"" and like... She's MY kid from a previous relationship. I carried her for 9 months! Not DW! And like whatever it'd be fine if she mentioned both of us (or neither of us, she only has one grandchild, everyone knows DD is DW's) but no, she does this. 

She tends to attribute a lot of shit to DW and completely ignore my input even if it was my idea, her whole family does. Like thank DW for loaning them money when I'm the one who heard they needed it and offered. They do this in front of me. 

Or the other day I tagged her in a post about a hobby of hers that I thought was cute. Someone else said ""this is so cool!"" or something like that and MIL says ""OP has the greatest taste, after all he married DW!"" Like wtf. What even is that.",JUSTNOMIL
"We had a destination wedding in Jamaica Memorial Day weekend (plus a legal ceremony in the states if you followed my drama with my new MIL last month). 

Most of the guests arrived the Wednesday/Thursday before the ceremony which was on Saturday 5/25 and left on Monday 5/27. We stayed until the following Saturday 6/1 (as in yesterday). My mom stayed until *Thursday*. I said that after Monday I would pretend anyone still there didn't exist, I used a joking tone to keep it light but did put it out there (since obviously I can't prevent anyone from staying at the resort.) 

We had been having breakfast together throughout the trip since only one place for breakfast at the resort and we are both early risers. On Tuesday at breakfast I told her, ""Its been really great having you at the wedding, but DH and I really want time together alone."" I thought that would be that. *NOPE!*

(Later) Her: ""I made reservations for us to go snorkeling together!"" 

""...Sorry we are already going [on a different excursion] then. You go without us.""

Next morning, DH and I are at breakfast. I specifically pick a two person table. She MOVES ANOTHER TABLE to sit with us. (I bit my tongue and said nothing which is my bad and I realize that.) 

Her:""What are *we* doing today?"" 

Me: ""DH are looking forward to spending time together..."" 

I figured she would get the hint. She didn't because later she was blowing up my phone. 

Her: ""It's raining. I'm bored."" 

Her: ""Come hang out with me!"" 

Her: ""They have board games in the lobby""

Her: ""All the good ones are taken but we can buy cards at the gift shop!""

I ignored her messages. Spent time alone with my husband in our hotel suite...since its my honeymoon.

Knocks on door. DH yelled out ""Coming"" while he threw shorts on because we thought it was hotel staff. Nope it was my mother. So her new Son-in-Law answers the door shirtless, wearing *only* gym shorts and ...

Her: ""Where is kw5112?"" 

DH: ""In bed...laying down"" (trying to be vague, accurate but not vulgar)

Her: ""Oh like taking a nap? Have you seen this rain? Its awful!""

DH: ""Did you need something?""

Her: ""Well I was looking for kw5112. I've been messaging her but she hasn't responded. Oh! Can I borrow her lotion?""

DH grabs the lotion that I silently mimed where he'll find it once he was out of view from her. Hands it to her.

Her: ""Thanks! Oh we are getting dinner at the Italian restaurant at 6:30 if you want to join us!""

DH: ""Maybe. Bye!""

We tried to resume but I was pissed off and not in a fun way. Plus my mother's voice is a huge turn off for me. And we went to dinner at the restaurant furthest from the one she went to at 7:30 to avoid her.

How could she think that was ok?! 

Hindsight I wish we switched resorts after the wedding weekend but we got an upgraded suite as part of the wedding package and would have had to pay more to have a similar room elsewhere. Plus the hassle of packing and moving again.

I'm super pissed.

"Long time lurker, first time poster.
Long story short, my in-laws divorced 15 years ago when my husband was 17ish.

MIL replaced FIL with my husband and he become “the man of the house” and her emotional support. 
I turned up about 5 years later, and things were fine until I got pregnant and we married.
We’ve been NC for 7.5 years.  Obviously a lot happened that caused that, but this is the abridged version.

My FILs father’s (so, my husbands grandfather)  80th party is coming up and JNMIL has been invited because she’s still so involved in my FIL’s siblings lives. 

FIL, DH and I are incredibly unimpressed. 

How do we deal with this? We don’t yet know if she’s going. We have 2 amazing kids who do not know her and we want to protect them from all toxicity.  She is just so....JN. In so many ways.
We’ve greatly enjoyed our 7.5 years peace.
We want to be there for Grandad. It’s a 520km trip (each way) and we have already committed to going. 

Surely being out of the family for 15 years should mean you cut ties?",JUSTNOMIL
"Ugh. Okay. So I posted here a little while ago about my grandmother and my mom, and I received a lot of support so I thought I’d try again. On mobile so sorry about formatting.

&amp;nbsp;

My mom has come around and isn’t as JustNo as she was. I think seeing how her mom is behaving and remembering how her mom and grandmother behaved at her own wedding are making her not want to cause drama for mine. Her mom, my grandmother, on the other hand... 

&amp;nbsp;

I guess I’ll need to provide a little bit of background. My grandparents divorced when my mom was young and my grandfather basically abandoned them. Not a cool thing to do, obviously. But my mom has reconciled with him as an adult and our family has had somewhat of a relationship with him my entire life. So, since we’re all on good terms, I invited him and his family (including his siblings’ families) to the wedding. My mom insisted that they all be invited, as she has a great relationship with them. My grandmother even encouraged her to have a relationship with them.

&amp;nbsp;

My grandmother has been stirring up so much sh*t with my mom specifically about inviting that side of the family, especially my grandfather. It started a couple of months ago, but she seemed to calm down and agree that they could all be civil. Last night, however, she called my mother again spewing hatred and threatening to not come to the rehearsal or the wedding if they aren’t uninvited. Mind you, my wedding is this weekend. According to my mom, she didn’t seem to remember them talking this out a few months ago.

&amp;nbsp;

I’m not sure if this is a sign of dementia or not, or the medications she’s been on. But normally my grandmother is good at putting on a sweet old lady face in front of company. My mom is super worried that if she comes, she’s going to be rude and/or cold to everyone. Personally I’d like for her to show up but do not tolerate manipulation and will not bend to her will. She sent me an email last night asking for details about the rehearsal, so I honestly think she knows she’s wrong and wants to come. My moms on the verge of uninviting her completely. 

&amp;nbsp;

The reason I’m posting is because I’m planning on calling my grandmother this afternoon. While I don’t plan on being manipulated, I’m still not great at confrontation. I need advice on how to talk with her about her behavior and how she is to behave for the wedding. I was also planning on inviting my grandfather to the rehearsal dinner, which might make her implode. Please help!

***UPDATE***

&amp;nbsp;
I gave her a call, and went over some details for the rehearsal dinner and ceremony. She had a few weird opinions about how it should be done traditionally, but seemed to accept everything I said (in an “whatever, it’s your wedding...” kind of way). When I brought up bringing my grandfather to the rehearsal dinner and the ceremony, she seemed oddly calm about it. She asked a few questions such as where they’d be sitting (not near her). The worst thing she said was “I’m not going to do any entertaining.” To which I said “that’s just fine, just sit there, smile and look pretty!” In a jovial way of course. That’s the kind of stuff that’s important to her anyway. She didn’t bring up her fight with my mom at all. Who knows, maybe she’ll call and give her crap later, and blame her for putting “ideas” in my head. Whatever. I tried. I think she’s decided to come to the wedding. I think I’ll sit my most talkative bridesmaid by her.",JUSTNOMIL
"So, even though this is about my grandmother, this post will mainly focus on her relationship with my mother and my father, because it's honestly *so fucking weird*.

So, my mother and my father have been married for over 20 years now, and it's quite obvious their marriage has been dead for at least 15 or so. It has to do with issues on both sides, but I think my grandmother plays a big role in this whole thing.

My grandmother basically raised my father and his brother almost on her own, since my grandfather died when my father was 5. I have never once in my life heard her mention him. There are no photographs of him in her house. Every bit of information of him I have I've got through my mother who in turn got it from my father's distant (read: from his father's side of the family) cousins, like how my grandmother's home was entirely paid by her husband and how she never got in touch with his family after his death. The only ones who they had contact with were my grandfather's brothers who helped raise my father and my uncle.

However, my grandmother, understandably, was very close to her sisters, so my father and uncle grew up with their cousins, and are extremely close to them. So much so that my father is always speaking candidly to my aunt (his cousin) and cracking jokes and being this cheerful persona he only becomes when he is talking to them or about them. He speaks so fondly of his cousins and their children (my own, older, kind of distant because I'm much younger than them) and all of their achievements so often it has sometimes made me jealous and/or weirded me out since I was a kid, especially since they seem to care the most about me excelling at education. Thinking about it, he kind of acts like a kid during those times, to be honest.

My father is very very close to that side of the family, but what my uncle and him display to my grandmother is actual adoration and at times becomes disturbing. I often feel left out and I'm my grandmother's only grandchild, my uncle's only niece and my father's only child. They are all over her all the time, and seem to become little children showing an exaggerated amount of affection (I would even call it obssession) towards their mother. My father, who I have to admit, is quite pedantic, is always talking to my grandmother about politics and history and while these are topics that I enjoy, they kind of make me feel like I'm not there. If I make a comment they barely pay any attention to me or treat me as if I were stupid and understood less than they do. My father does not behave this warmly and eagerly towards anyone. I feel like an outsider inside my own family. My uncle, who reaches far more disturbing levels of adoration towards my grandmother, kind of sulks the whole time my father is there. He only joins in the conversation when my father is not there and I can talk to my grandmother like a regular person, without feeling like I don't matter. But when this happens, his behavious changes: he acts at times like a child, at times like some sort of boyfriend (oh god, I think I just puked a little inside my mouth). He sometimes behaves normally during the conversation, but then he'll start constantly touching her all the time, stroking her face and her hair and taking her hand and kissing her on the cheek, and snuggling with her and making some comment about his ""mommy"". It freaks me out, honestly. He lives with her and is not married and spends 90% of his spare time at home, the other 10% outside worrying about her. He can't leave her alone for a minute but doesn't even think about hiring someone to take care of her or help him during the day. He bathes her, takes her to the bathroom, helps her dress, wakes up at least three times every night to give her some pills... my grandmother is 95 and last year my great-aunt lived with them as well (as she had for about 40 years), and my uncle took care of her as well. She had alzheimer and was terrible to deal with. My uncle had to take care of her as well and do everything he does for my grandmother, but double, with the added complication of my great-aunt having lost her mind completely. He also had to feed her and deal with her whenever she got agressive or started screaming. I can see how this situation might have led to my uncle basically losing his sanity and becoming absolutely obssessed with my grandmother, especially since my great-aunt died last year. She was 97 and to be honest it was the best thing that could have happened to her. She was no longer able to speak or move on her own, had become very agressive and didn't recognise anyone. Even my father got fed up at times with my uncle's demand that he be there for my grandmother and great-aunt and him making a big deal about any single thing and wanted to have someone to help them take care of the two and maybe even send my great-aunt to a home. When she died, we were sad, but again, it was the best thing that could have happened. My uncle tried to make doctors do anything they could to keep her alive for longer, even though our whole family refused. He acted like a little child, locking himself in the bathroom and spent months and months crying at the mention of her name, even when my grandmother didn't. During her funeral, one of their oldest cousins slapped him accross the face and told him to pull himself together.

My uncle, though, has always had quite the temper. He used to be very outgoing and flirty years ago when he actually left his house, but now he's become a shadow of his former self and even if we try to get him to do something, he'll always obssess over my grandmother first. He's lost so much weight, and in the last few years has developed heart problems. But he's always been an asshole if you cross him, though. He hasn't talked to my father in years unless it's about my grandmother and whether this 86th time he's taken her to the hospital for nothing she is very sick, or what they are going to give her as a gift (my father just talked to him about getting her some documents from some farm she visited when she was a kid and putting them in a gold frame. Last Christmas he found a letter written to a friend of hers years ago and created a whole children's tale, bound and signed, about what a great ""kid"" she is from ""Santa"" (actually, not Santa, but my country's version). He never got anything for my mother or me).

My uncle and my grandmother have been assholes to my mother from day 1. She came from a family with a completely different background that doesn't have this insane level of attachment and was more ""modern"" than my grandmother's. For example, she was angry that on Christmas they (my mother's side of the family) set up a Christmas tree, with basically my grandmother's and my father's version of ""that's too mainstream"". My father still acts like that whenever I helped my mother decorate for Christmas until the last few years, when we just stopped completely. Until this year, I didn't know how bad it was, though.

I always knew that my uncle and my grandmother didn't get along very well with my mother. My mother hardly ever wanted to visit my grandmother unless my father made her, and she always seemed as out of place in their home as I do when my father starts a conversation with my grandmother. However, a few months ago I heard my mother talk to her sister about how my grandmother is the person she hates the most and how she is the one to blame for her marriage falling apart. I think there are more issues involved, because my mother and my father are very different people (my mother usually being more outgoing, and she liked to do more ""common"" things that my father disregarded as ""frivolous"" like going shopping or going out with her friends for dinner; whereas my father is basically a cross between a very studious monk and, as one of my uncles put it, ""an amoeba"", but with really bad temper at times. He also always tends to put himself first, and never wants to do anything my mother would like even when my mother sometimes does attend things he enjoys despite her not really feeling like it. Last week some friends invited them to spend a day at the beach and though my mother really wanted to go, the first thing my father said was how ""people just didn't understand that he doesn't like the beach"". One time he didn't even notice I didn't speak him for days, and another time he only noticed because he needed to ask me something and I refused to answer. He also keeps a close relationship with my mother's brother, who has treated my mother horribly and acts basically the way the stereotypical creepy uncle would act towards me, even in front of my father, and he does nothing about this.

But, apparently, my grandmother and by extension my uncle have been treating her like shit since forever. My mother got really angry one day and confessed to me how her IL family have treated her and why she doesn't want to see them. My grandmother prohibited my mother from accepting any gifts from my father, because one time years ago he gave her a pendant and my grandmother found out, and called my mother to scream at her over the phone about never accepting those kinds of gifts again and ""making my father buy her things"" and how she'd ""know what was coming"" if she ever found out that it happened again. Her and my great-aunt scolded my mother when she couldn't physically breastfeed me as a baby. She threatened my mother because she felt that I was spending more time with my maternal grandmother than with her, which led to me going every weekend to one of my grandmother's to have lunch to ""make it equal"", even though my maternal grandmother wouldn't get angry if I skipped a weekend or wanted to go to my friend's instead. My father, however, has always been pushing me to go visit my grandmother as much as I could and has sometimes called me ""selfish"" for not going for some time. My uncle has tried to emotionally blackmail me about spending more time at my grandmother's. My uncle also called my mother ""a bitch"" and her friends (who I consider family) ""sons of whores"" because when I was little one time she wanted to take me from my grandmother's to go and visit them. He was also driving from my grandmother's town with my father, her and me when I was a baby and had been playing in the dirt, and she had cleaned me up and I was sucking on my thumb, and screamed at her for ""poisoning me"" all the way until we reached home, with my father quiet in the car. She told me that had I not been there, she would have thrown herself out of the car.

My mother finally reached her limit and snapped today when my father decided to get my grandmother yet another gift for no actual reason when he didn't even get us anything for Christmas or her birthday or mine, and accused him of being obsessed with my grandmother and ""in love"" with her. I honestly can't disagree with her. I feel terrible thinking about how my mother has been so neglected during her marriage and how my father, grandmother and uncle have treated her. I feel like she only stayed married because of me and now she can't leave, and how my grandmother has manipulated my father into ""being"" the way he is (my mother has sworn time and time again that my father wasn't like this when they married. I feel like he probably always was this person on the inside and this is one of those cases when you don't start noticing how a person truly is until you marry them). I love (or loved) my grandmother and my uncle, but I've been feeling so disturbed lately and I'm so sad and angry about the way they treated my mother that I felt like I needed to see what other people thought of this situation.

EDIT: I also forgot to mention how my mother hates her for ""never letting us have holidays"" but despite the fact that in the last few years we never went anywhere as a family (because if my grandmother or my aunt got sick, my uncle would have to stay with one of them in the hospital and my father with the other at home), as much as my mother refuses to admit this, it's not because of my grandmother. As I mentioned previously, my father always puts himself first and hates going to the beach and travelling, in general. Whenever we went on holiday to the beach it was always for an extremely short time and my father would complain all the time. If we went somewhere else he would get sick. The last time I actually visited the beach with my mother we actually went there with my mother's friends and their children (two couples and their children, and her and me). My father was only there for one day and the only thing he did was tell us about this great gift his church friends and him has gotten for the vicar.

**tl;dr:** my father and uncle have a creepy obssession towards my grandmother that borders on emotional incest and makes me uncomfortable and my mother believes that my grandmother was the pulling the strings so that my parents' marriage fail, and though I don't think it failed solely because of that, my grandmother played a big part in alienating my father from my mother, and acted like a complete bitch towards my mother to the point that she is the person my mother hates the most.",JUSTNOMIL
"I am not married yet but I live together with my girlfriend so I really hope that's okay. Thank you for taking the time to read my story! My girlfriend's mom sure already feels like my MIL already, ugh. 

&amp;#x200B;

MIL (50s) has always had a peculiar smell. Over the last few months it has gotten significantly worse. I (M28) always thought that the smell originated from her wardrobe and her clothes but after analysing a bit more it could be everything in her house that stinks. It is not a body-odour related smell. She only has secondhand (or third/fourth-hand nobody knows) furniture and carpets that she hasn't gotten cleaned in like 15 years. She was over for the night last week and I have since had to throw away multiple bedsheets and towels. This because the sheets and towels we had given her, even after being washed in the laundry machine, had given off a smell on our other sheets and towels after being put in the same drawer. I also had to get the sheets for the couch dry-cleaned and had to mop the floor multiple times until I was able to remove the stench that her bags had transferred onto it. It was probably over 200 bucks worth of stuff that we've had to throw away. Cleaning it doesn't even completely work. I had a severe migraine the entire time she was over, because the smell was so debilitating. And the next day I unfortunately had to leave my niece's second birthday prematurely as well, because I still felt very groggy and sick. 

&amp;#x200B;

Girlfriend (F25) and I have dropped hints to her that some things in her house do not smell 'fresh'. But neither my girlfriend or her other direct family is bothered by the smell as much as I am (they're probably very used to it). Girlfriend does recognise the smell I speak about though and calls it ""stale/musty"". Let me tell you - it's much more than that. Probably relevant that I have always had a very keen sense of smell and sensitive to it (girlfriend is very aware of this). My girlfriend doesn't seem to want or know how to confront MIL about it further however. The girlfriend and MIL have had a lot of other problems together recently as well that I try to stay out of (MIL getting into ""alternative medicine"", even anti-vaccine stuff) - but perhaps not important to this post. For me it has gotten to the point where I don't want her to come over until she addresses her smell. I also fear that I cannot go over to visit her anymore, because if this is how she smells when she's at ours, I can't even begin to imagine what her house must now smell like. I don't think I would have a problem with telling MIL about it, but my girlfriend keeps saying that she doesn't want me to. I feel like it would be helpful to her, but my girlfriend thinks it would be too painful. I see a big obstacle for our future because being around MIL just puts me in a terrible mood and I even get feelings of resentment. AND MIL is slowly becoming a topic my girlfriend and I cannot even talk about because we can't seem to come to resolutions together. I don't really want to tell my girlfriend about it too much because I know how difficult she finds it to confront MIL about anything (MIL known to have childish, hysterical reactions). Confrontations also generally put my girlfriend under a lot of stress, something I in turn start resenting about her because I usually can find relief in them. 

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? Should I tell MIL any way? I feel like when she essentially vandalises my belongings with her smell I should be able to say something and MIL should want to hear it right? I would want someone to tell me. I do not want to cause further friction between my girlfriend and MIL though, and I don't want really want talk to my girlfriend's parents behind her back if she doesn't want me to. But I don't think my girlfriend has yet to grasp the seriousness of how I experience this and what problems I foresee coming to us.",JUSTNOMIL

Now a lot of this has treatment from TROC, as well as what some kind hearted folks have said in the comments, has me thinking about what kind of Mother I want to be. Namely, how I don't want to be anything like TROC. And there's some stuff that I didn't feel was quite long enough to merit it's own post but now that I've written it all out, I can see there's more buried here than I'd thought. This tale is one that has been gnawing at me for some time to share here. So I'm finally gonna drag this skeleton out of the closet and lay it out here. 



●

~My First Kiss~


I was 14yo and TROC had been ""home schooling"" me for about 5yrs at that point. I had basically been socially isolated with only the occasional interaction with the neighbor kids (whom where all younger than me might I add). Not to mention that TROC made it a nightmare to watch TV...when we had one. She'd have it on a stand  that we had to move and crawl behind to plug the TV in if we wanted to watch anything, and then we had to unplug the TV and move the stand back when we were done. Oh and we were NEVER allowed to see anything related to Harry Potter unless it was a religious ""HP is of the devil!"" sort of ~~brainwashing~~ broadcast. (This is relevant, and helps set the scene for what I was dealing with at this point in my life) 


So for the most part I found solace and respite in fantasy and fiction novels, and a lot of romance books (some of which were not for teens...😶) I had heard stories about how a first kiss could be magical and special and I desperately wanted that. I wanted some Cute Boy to notice me. I wanted someone to actually be attracted to ME (I was at my heaviest around this time standing in at 5'3"" and 165 lbs. I carried most of my weight in my chest and hips...in other words, I was rocking a major hourglass like figure) I felt so fat and ugly and like I was the most undesirable wretch because I was ""overweight AND a diabetic! Who would want to be with someone like me?!"" (Take a guess as to who was crushing my self esteem) 



It didn't help that I didn't have much of a social pool to learn how to flirt with guys or have someone be interested in me. The tiny church youth group wasn't exactly leaving me much to work with and the youth Pastor's do their damndest to shut down anything more than the mildest flirting. 




Anyway, one day TROC takes me and LB out to Grandma's farm to visit with our cousins for the weekend. (Don't get grossed out) We get there and discover that cousins had brought a couple of friends with them. 2 brothers to be exact. One of which was about 15yo if I recall correctly (they were very close in age) 

I had only just noticed them when TROC points them out and comments on ""how hunky"" they both were. 🤢 



I did my best to be as normal as possible and tried flirting as best as I was able (it was...awkward). We ALL ended up being camped out in the living room that night and Random Cousin's Friend (whom I deemed the cutest of the 2...not really my type but cute enough) was on the couch while I had the floor next to the couch (I've spent a LOT of my life sleeping on the floor) well after lights out and everyone else going to sleep we stayed up chatting and he made his move. I had my first kiss and he tried to grope me...I never told anyone that part before. I was disappointed to say the least. And the next day I noticed he was reading the 5th HP book so I tried chatting about it with him but he wouldn't give me the time of day. So then I just felt like this dirty lil secret. And I hated him for being such a selfish prick and knowing that that was how I would always remember my first kiss. 


Now, you may be wondering what any of this has to do with TROC aside from a wildly inappropriate remark before that cursed kiss? 


It doesn't end there. I was young, naive, and still deep in the FOG. This would be one of those moments that would forever change me and the way I saw TROC. 



She picks us up and asks how our weekend was. I told her ""I got my first kiss."" I said it in the most deadpan, flat, and factual tone a teenager can muster, and said while staring out the window like any melancholy teen. TROC...didn't bother to take note of my tone or body language which screamed ""it sucked and I wish I could take it back"". No. She squealed and started badgering me with questions that I didn't bother with replying too. I think I just cut her off with something like ""I don't wanna talk about it"". She scowled but she let it drop. Little did I know...



Later that week (I think? This happened a long time ago) we all go to The Club of the Sam's for some crap and TROC gets talking with the cashier. I'm bored, hot, and tired from walking around the giant warehouse store so I ask if I can get the keys and start loading up the car (she would literally stand there talking to the cashier who was one of her favorites for a while and we had already paid.) She just hands me the keys. So I'm walking out to the car (it was a loooooong walk. I remember that much) and all of a sudden I realize that the cashier lady has come RUNNING out of the store up to me. I'm alarmed to say the least. The cashier then starts babbling about how it's so exciting getting your first kiss but also that I'm ""much to young for that stuff yet!"" I'm sure there was more but the bit about how I'm too young to be kissing is forever seared in my brain. And then she had to run all the way back inside to her post at the register *because she was still on the clock!* I then had to find our car with tears in my eyes because this was a deep betrayal of my trust and it was just throwing salt in the wound of my awful first kiss experience. I cried until TROC got back to the car and ripped into her about how wrong it was of her to go telling strangers MY PERSONAL BUSINESS. I think I gave her the silent treatment for a week afterwards. She of course never saw anything wrong with what she did and never apologized for it. Complete DARVO (I just didn't know there was a term for it back then)

I'm not perfect, not by a long shot. I'm human and I make mistakes. I know I'll make my own mistakes with my own kid but the difference is, I'm willing to admit I was wrong. I'm willing to sincerely apologize to my LO when I do mess up. I may not always pick up on my child's signals but I'll do my best to pay attention, to listen, to ask what their thoughts and feelings are about stuff. Especially big life moments like a first kiss (if I'm so lucky that my child tells me about it) and I'll respect if they don't want to share to many details (but I'll check that they weren't hurt by it). Because telling TROC about my first kiss was as emotionally violating as if she had read my diary. And I've always felt disgusted by how I have to drag so much as a forced apology from her and she's basically kicking and screaming the whole way when I do. I've never once received a genuine apology from her. Not even something that could almost pass as a real apology. I won't do that to my child.",JUSTNOMIL
"So it's been in the plans that my MIL NWJ was going to put her condo on the market and moved down to OR with BIL.  Last week DH stayed up Tuesday &amp; Wednesday nights with her (because of his job) so apparently, she no longer wants to be in OR (not sure if it's because of what DH has said: he's worried that BIL would blow through her entire estate &amp; screw him out of dh's share or if it's because BIL is very rude &amp; controlling of NWJ) but all of a sudden, she doesn't want to move.  So the plot thickens.  And in August we all go down to the Shakespeare play festival almost into CA. It's NWJ, BIL, DH, a cousin &amp; her DH &amp; myself.  BIL will come to get NWJ &amp; all of a sudden, she riding home with us. He didn't ask me, it's my car &amp; just told me.  Oh, he'll be taking me to the yarn shop for that screw-up.

Now for XMIL estate, (so it's XBIL#1, XH, XBIL#2 &amp; XSIL &amp; 11 grandkids &amp; 19 great-grandchildren &amp; 3 great-great-grandchildren) when XFIL passed away 13 years ago, she sold all of their real states, home &amp; moved from my hometown &amp; moved to the West side of the Cascade Mts, she ordered a fancy modules home, put it a gated senior community.  She also purchased 6 CDs (these were for the only people in the family that were mentioned in her will, XBIL#1 &amp; 2, XSIL, XBIL#2 son &amp; XSIL 2 DD's notice not XH!) when XMIL was dying, XSIL came over to take care of her mom. My ODD &amp; ODGD went out to say goodbye about a week or so before she passed.  XSIL kept giving my ODGD cash (which was weird as she's a meth head &amp; has no money) but ODD said she kept acting she had come into all this cash.  The day after XMIL passed XSIL &amp; her YDD had gone thru the house &amp; loaded up both of their cars &amp; 2 Uhauls &amp; took everything worth anything in the house.  XBIL#1 is the executor of the estate &amp; the will has gone MIA.  So come to find out XMIL has been holding a grudge against me for almost 23 years because XH didn't/couldn't force my sister and I to go with her attorney &amp; real estate agent when our mom passed away suddenly with no will.  XMIL tried to steal our parent's house &amp; fuck us out of our inheritance.  So because of all this my XH got fucked over &amp; he wants to sue me! What a hoot! Oh the 2 XBIL's have both hired attorneys to go after their sister.  Oh man, I am having a great laugh. Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.",JUSTNOMIL
"Sit back, grab a brew, this ~~could be a long~~ sorry, IS a long one! Its about MY perception of the relationship (or lack of) with my mother.

I don't think I could never claim to have had a close relationship with my mother. I’ve had closer with my step father, step brothers and their wives.

Middle to end of November 2018 she made the long awaited move from East Anglia back down South leaving the house for us 3 boys to sort out and get ready for market. One brother lives in the Midlands (as do we), is not a well chap, his service in HM Forces having caught up with him. The other lives in the South. I went across following her move out and found a pig sty waiting for us. She literally packed most of what she wanted and buggered off!

I’ll try and keep this short . . . er! We had to bin bed clothes, soiled clothes, food, food waste, scrub kitchen units caked in grease, scrub toilets, floors, rip out carpets and underlay that was stained and stinking and while this was going on, I had to run a car full of stuff that she had “forgotten” down South. I took that car load to brother 2 as I left at 4.30am to get there for 8am so I could unload and then start the journey home.

17th December saw a phone call from her, I answered expecting an information bearing and grateful mother. Information being her new address and phone number which she hadn’t given us and perhaps grateful for making the 360 + mile round trip with her bits n bobs. NO! None of the above. She was however hung up on the 2 bottles of Baileys that weren’t with the stuff that magic’d its way to her. They were on the kitchen side and I should have known that she would have wanted them.

The only problem here was they weren’t in the house, at all! The only bottle of alcohol in the house was an unopened bottle of rose which we gave to the neighbour for being such a sport and holding the house keys for us. This news went down so badly that she hung up and hasn’t made contact since – some 5 months have elapsed.

She phones and talks to my step brothers. She sees them for tea and cake and that bit doesn’t actually bother me and I’m glad someone can report back how she’s doing.  BUT - I think that I do get it now . . . .

I get that I must have ruined whatever career plans she had. I get that she had to leave the WRAF to have me (out of wedlock with no relationship to support her). I then tied her down right through to the time I left home at 17. However, it wasn’t me that chased around with a married RAF officer and got pregnant. That bit wasn’t my fault. At least he stuck by things with a fiver a week but she would never ever talk to me about him and I will never know him for that reason.

I’m not sorry I joined the army, I’m not sorry I did what I did and saw what I saw – those experiences really dragged the man from the boy. I’m not sorry I married my wife who she seems to have taken such a dislike too, that she couldn't even have a civil conversation with my wife if I wasn’t around when she did call.

I am sorry we couldn’t have children and give her the grandkid/s she may have wanted from us, but she never asked why, just dropped acidic little remarks. I’ve seen her cast a similar silence over others, but never thought I would be subject to one myself. I must be such a disappointment to her, such a weight she has now managed to shed. I wish her no malice and I’m here if she ever sees fit to get in touch, but I will not be knocking on her door anytime soon (if I knew where it was). Have a wonderful life.

God I feel sooooooo much better for getting that out !!!",JUSTNOMIL
"Keeping it vague yet again. My location was discovered. No, it did not end well. No, I can't take the kids and flee again. No, we weren't physically harmed. Apparently their connections reach out here for what they made happen today. This is exactly why I didn't run in the first place. This is exactly what I knew would happen.             
                                                              
For future reference, if someone says they can't leave, please respect that. Don't tell them to do it anyway. Some people are just too powerless to leave. Some of us have to wait it out.               
              
For the love of cake, STOP TELLING ME TO JUST RUN ANYWAY OR CALL THE DAMN COPS. Why do people continue to suggest that?! Do you see what the fuck that did to my children and I?! You do realize that there's three lives affected now. Two of which are under 3 years old.",JUSTNOMIL
"I want to scream. I feel physically ill as I write this. I think I might actually be at the last straw.

Backstory: My (24F) boyfriend's (25M) mother (50s-ishF) has for the past 1.5 years guilted him out of $10,000. Yes. $10,000. The entire time I've known her, she's tried to get him to buy a house with her, co-sign $30k of his military loan to get her a house, lie to realtors for her, buy her alcohol, put her car under his insurance, etc. etc. Every single time, I have to CONVINCE him not to do anything she says. If I don't step in, he does it and drains his savings.

Finally, he's started to stand up to her. The only payment he's still making to her is $400 a month for HER vehicle. The thing is, her vehicle was bought for her by another one of her sons, who can't even afford the vehicle. So she's making my boyfriend pay for the vehicle. $400 every single month for the last 1.5 years.

He finally stood up to her and emailed her, said he will not be making any payments on her vehicle after June 4th and it needs to stop. She ignored the email.

He emailed her again yesterday. She ignored it for a day then today, just now, she emailed him the following:

""My 'financial behavior,' as you put it, is tied to bills that affect more than just you and me. They affect our whole family. I have been deep in debt trying to pay off bills and it is not working. I had to leave my townhouse because the rent was going on too long. I'm behind on bills for [other 2 vehicles] and now you want me to take on the payments for the [her car] too.""

First of all, her two other sons lose their jobs every few months for smoking weed and showing up late, not showing up at all etc. The only person she ever begs for money is my boyfriend. The only thing she ever makes him pay money for is HER things. Her car. Her house. Her rent. Her alcohol. Her food. Her furniture. Yet she claims it affects the whole family.

Second of all, just a few hours before this, my boyfriend's brother (the one who bought his mother the car) texts my boyfriend and says ""Hey, I know I was going to start taking over on the car payments for mom, but with the back tattoo I just got I won't have enough. Instead of paying the $400 per month for the car now, can I pay $200 and you cover the rest?""

My boyfriend says YES. His brother spent $400 on a BACK TATTOO, coincidentally of course the same amount the car payment is.

Okay, I think after typing this I need to also crosspost to JUSTNOSO. 

I am at my breaking point. I don't know what to do. I want this woman out of our lives until she completely stops asking for money. I want this to end. 

What do I do? I've had it at this point. I love my boyfriend dearly but how do I get this to end for good?",JUSTNOMIL
"If ya’ll saw the post basically reassuring me that I made the right decision to cut off my mother, who I’m now nicknaming here Money Dearest, because that’s all she gives a rip about. Couple of questions. 

I currently have her blocked off of all social media formats that I know she has and that’s not changing. I also have her number blocked on my phone and my husband’s phone. But I have old texts saved from her regarding threats she’s made to me. Should I unblock her number, solely to keep a record of anything recent that I can use against her in case she gets a wild hair up her ass and tries to utilize grandparents rights against me even tho she knows nothing about my child other than the fact that I’m pregnant? 

If not, I plan to change my phone number and potentially port my number to a prepaid phone with my phone carrier at Verizon. Anyone wanna walk me through how this is done?

And is she required to know where I’m located for a restraining and/or no contact order? I want to make sure I have my legal ducks in a row. I already know about keeping when I’m in the hospital to give birth restricted and show them her name and photo, as well as her pedo’s information, as well so they’re kept away. 

Any and all insight would be helpful. Due to this being a public form, I don’t want to say where I’m located but will via PM if anyone has really good insight. Thank you!",JUSTNOMIL
"My stepmother was talking about how she visited a part of the city for the first time in 20 years. She grew up near there but now it’s SO different because Asians. (It’s well known to be where a lot of wealthy Asian people live but I guess she hasn’t been to see it in person). 

She said her parents would be “rolling in their grave” if they saw it now. 
I asked, “what? Why?!”  
“Because of all the Asians!!”

I told her that was a horrible thing to say... plus it’s an awesome place to get dumplings. She didn’t have much to say after that. What a horrible woman, I can’t even believe she would think that let alone say it out loud.

EDIT- I forgot to say! She then showed me a shirt that she bought. “It’s really good quality, was only $15 from a Japanese store!” 
Sorry lady, you can’t complain about Asians then use their stuff",JUSTNOMIL
"See BB for my last post. But I really wanted to thank everyone for their kind comments. Its been a really rough day here as I woke up to a response from JNMIL sometime around 3/4am.  This is a long one, I apologize in advance.   
A little background: Our families know each-other, our Dads were friends and JNFIL use to hang out frequently with my uncle. There is a history there, but its between our parents not DH and I. I only remember meeting JNFIL once as a child where I told him that I was going to marry DH when I grew up. DH and I knew each-other when we were kids, he moved away when we were young, but we reconnected in University, completely fell head over heals and got engaged almost right away. Wedding was 18 months later and we paid for most of it ourselves. There was a lot of drama around the wedding from JNMIL because she and JNGIL wanted us to wait 2 years and we did not. JNMIL insulted my Mother at my bridal shower and complained loudly at our wedding. Through the grapevine I had heard she was telling people I married DH for his money and so I could be a lazy stay at home mom. Funny enough, she doesn't work and lives off of JNFIL's salary. Anyway. She pretty much ruined or tainted every major life event if it didn't fit into her little world and I rebelled quite a bit, although not in the nicest ways sometimes, but I try to own that and have worked hard on being less reactive and more thoughtful.   


So on to the update (this all happened in a group chat):  
JNMIL responds to my request for proof of us micromanaging them and she couldn't give me one. To be honest I know we have house rules but they aren't crazy and if she had some insane idea of a different rule that I didn't say or isn't valid anymore, it would be nice to know so we could clarify.  She went on saying that trying to talk about these things always ends with hurt feelings and everyone being defensive. SO, I called her out on basically ignoring my question and other comments, that things need to be talked about (and that they should have been along the way) and that by not we are making things worse. I also suggested that they talk to a therapist or counselor to help them communicate better because how they are handling this is really unhealthy.   


DH was awesome for someone just coming out of the fog, said that he'd rather talk about it than let things get worse. She immediately says that talking about is making it more awkward and causing people to get defensive, that we are wanting to push them away.   


After seeing how upset DH was about how this was going, I called JNMIL out again (shes such a hypocrite...really) that she and JNFIL are the only ones getting defensive here and that we've been trying to talk to them about this for years but JNFIL and JNSIL both left the chat just as this all started. JNMIL repeats this fact (that they were not in this chat) and I sat there for a moment to admire how dumb she looked.   


THEN, she tells drops this bomb on us. I will write out word for word because because a lot of the dislike from them I have always heard second hand or just got a vibe from them so I had secretly hoped I was just misunderstanding them and people weren't passing the message on very well. I was wrong. Very wrong.   


\~ JNMIL : You don't want to hear what we say! Why are you not talking to your family? I think you guys are the issue. You maybe more of the issue. DD is used as your pawn.  \~  


And there I saw it, right there in plain sight. She and JNFIL blame me for everything, DH not being around as much to help them, them not having a super close relationship with DD (despite when DH and I were separated for almost two years, which is a different story related to this B.S, they saw her weekly) and for all of this drama. All my fault.   


It wasn't directed at anyone else. I am NC with my JNMom and I haven't talked to them about it, for obvious reasons, but anyway. I saw RED, was vibrating I was so mad. My response was not as friendly as I probably should been, but it wasn't as mean as my first 2 drafts before I hit send, which contained a lot of F-bombs. I am really proud of myself for standing up for my little family. The mama bear came out and is hard to contain.   


\~ Me: First of all, we literally are asking you, why would we ask if we didn't want to hear what you were saying. Second of all, what is going on with my family is none of your business and you will not bring it up again unless I initiate it if you have even a glimmer of getting passed this with us.  You and JNFIL have always treated me like an outsider, accusing me of stealing DH from you, using him for his money, etc; and I have sat by and taken it for years. You both have insulted me, my family, the way I was raised, and how DH and I choose to raise DD and any attempt in defending myself has been met with more dislike towards me so I have did my best to keep my mouth shut. You have ruined major life events by interjecting your wants and needs above others, if you want examples I would be HAPPY to share those with you because I have a list ready and waiting. DD is our daughter, not a pawn and how DARE you suggest otherwise. The only people that have ever tried to use her as a pawn is you and JNFIL, putting buying her gifts every time you see her over spending quality time with her, getting to know her. I am sick of pussy footing around trying to not hurt your feelings because DH is so protective of your sensitive nature. If you want a relationship with me or DD, I would recommend you get a therapist and figure out why you seem to put the entirety of the blame on us rather than taking a look in the mirror and taking responsibility for your own part in this. Quite frankly I am done with this, your assumptions and accusations.  \~  


At this point I am hopeful, and in tears, thinking maybe she would read my words and see how hurt I am and at least apologize. But I wouldn't be here if it did so I'll continue.   


JNMIL said that DD is a pawn in the game of life and we both know it. By this point DH had made a few comments about how they do nothing with other people and how JNMIL literally sits at home and wallows all the time, that its not healthy nor normal as he has discovered by living away from them (dare I say hes slowly coming out of the fog?) and that its not about who is at fault anymore but that we need to talk about it!   


My final comment was this.   


\~ You clearly have no intention of having a constructive conversation. We are going to ask you to please not talk to us until you have read what you have said to us and apologized \~  


Her suggestion was that I do the same. Instead of telling her to go do something to herself, I told her it was her loss not ours.   


DH backed me up, said that he agrees with me and then turned the chat notifications off for the week.   


I am worried they will escalate but with how lazy they are I am sure they will probably just sit at home and wallow in this drama and blame us for everything instead of actually doing the work to make it better. Frankly at this point I don't trust either of them and JNSIL and JNFIL can stay where they are too and I do not wish to see or speak to any of them for awhile, or at least until I am not so rage-y about it.   


Did I handle this okay? What should be our next step? They have no keys to our house, not on any pick up list at school or emergency contacts for anything and we have a video door bell. I doubt they will do anything but I don't like surprises either.",JUSTNOMIL
"So I'm 34+4. I had my baby shower yesterday. My husband and I have already discussed that he will be taking the first week off so we can spend it together and then my aunt will be coming afterwards. After that first week I asked my aunt to come visit to help me during the day while my husband is at work. He was initially unhappy that I would ask my aunt over his mother (my mother is dead)- I tried explaining that it's really who I feel most comfortable with- when I need help nursing I dont want his mother shoving my breast into babies mouth or helping me get to the bathroom. He wasnt thrilled with this explanation but seemed to accept it. Well, yesterday happens and my MIL states that she will be getting a hotel room for a week or two after baby is born. I spoke to my husband this morning about it and told him he needed to speak with his mother about it... hes like about what exactly... I said that she isnt needed. That my aunt will be here and theres no need for her to stay. He said well, I've already told her she didnt need to come but I cant stop her from renting a hotel room. I understand that this may be a true statement but felt that he could let her know that I will already have help so there isnt a need. He absolutely refuses to say anything else to her. Says that this is between me and his mother, not him. That I'm controlling and that he wants her there and that I'm being selfish because it's not about me, HA. I tried explaining that it actually is absolutely about me- I am the one having a major medical procedure- whether I push it out or have a C-section. I am going to be the one needing help. He said she wants to be here to help with baby which is exactly what I dont need. I have baby, baby will be breastfeeding- I need help with house chores, breastfeeding, taking the dogs out, etc... I've got the baby part. He said she wont want to help with breastfeeding or helping me to the bathroom- but holding baby while I shower, etc.... I feel like I'm so alone. I honestly regret most of this pregnancy and wish we never got pregnant. I am a baby maker and that's it. My husband is more concerned with his mother and her feelings then he is with his wife. We are not a united front. He sides with his mother and it makes me feel so lonely. 😭 I do t even know what I'm asking... maybe just need to vent, words of encouragement, something...
We have a marriage counseling session tomorrow and I cant wait. I need some kind of help.",JUSTNOMIL
"Short one, but an excellent example of how narcissism makes every relationship a competition. 

MIL from hell drops in randomly every few days, or every few weeks depending on how sociable she’s feeling. Was watching a game with JYFIL when she popped by.

I am a pretty low maintenance and relaxed person, and generally don’t wear makeup around the house or going out. The face people are used to is my bare face. This doesn’t mean I don’t like makeup or am against it in any way, and occasionally I’ll wear it at home for the heck of it.

I was wearing dark cranberry lipstick, a light tinted moisturizer (didn’t even cover my freckles) and mascara. Nothing too fancy.

In barges MIL, sees me, and immediately starts the barrage of “compliments”:

•’oh my god! You look so pretty! How did you do that!’

•’look at her, FIL! Isn’t she sexy!’

•’her lips look like a Cupid’s bow! Do this for us *purses lips into a kissy face*

•’you are SO GOOD at makeup! I wish I knew how to do that. You’ve got to teach me!’

•’you’re prettier than you think.’

•’I could never figure out how to do makeup like that.’

•’I used to be pretty like you’

(Cue 20 minute reassurance speech from FIL that indeed she was pretty in her youth)

.......

FFS. Y’all I am a totally average looking person, but daring to wear the slightest drop of makeup ALWAYS gets this exact response. It’s creepy and the instant competition she starts when she feels like someone might dethrone her. I’m 25 years younger than her, but she is NOT handling aging with grace. She told me she tells people she’s in her 60’s so she’ll look good for her age.",JUSTNOMIL
"Tl;dr- MIL has passively ""suggested"" that something is wrong with my son after finding out he was vaccinated, when before she found out, nothing was wrong and everything was fine. Need suggestions on how to shut this down.

Okay so I used to be a part of this community but I honestly got paranoid that my mother in law would try to find my reddit account and it would cause issues so I deleted all my posts and unjoined, but today this happened and I just need to vent majorly.

Alright to start, my husband and his parents are all antivaxers. It was never an issue until I became pregnant with our son and then my husband dropped the bomb that he felt the same way about vaccines as his parents. I am very provax and have never shied away from saying so, so it was kind of a shock. I respect his beliefs and their beliefs though, no matter how much I disagree.

Our son was born and at 6 months old (he is a little over a year old now) I made the decision to start getting him vaccinated after an outbreak of measles hit Dallas area and we live very close by and my husband works in Dallas. There is also an ongoing CPS case we are dealing with for my husband's daughters from his previous marriage and we are under a microscope for how well we take care of our son as well as how good of a home we will be for the girls. No doctor within a hundred mile radius will see my son for checkups without him being vaccinated and I doubt CPS would be happy about him not having vaccines. I didn't tell anyone about my decision to do this, not even my husband.

Last night, I finally admitted to my husband that our son is vaccinated and after some talking, we are okay. He did tell his parents though and this is where the issue has arisen. Just yesterday, I went with my inlaws to take my son down to the river and play around. Everything was fine we all had a good time. After last night telling my husband, I went to drop my son off at my inlaws (they watch him for free while I work part time and its all we can afford right now) this morning. Suddenly, this morning my MIL drops that she thinks my son has some sort of paralysis because he loses his balance easily (HE IS A YEAR OLD BABY!!!). I was sort of speechless since this has obviously never been an issue before and all of a sudden it is.

I just whatevered it and went to work because I was running late. When I went to pick him up, that's when it became evident what they (my MIL specifically) we doing. They say my son has not been very happy all day and that his head has been going from cold to hot all day. Now, my son is a sweater. He has been since he was born. Anytime he gets warm (especially now since its June and humid on top of hot) his head will get sweaty. Then once he gets in the shade or in the AC, his head will become cool to the touch. He is also very warm blooded. This warm to cold thing is nothing new at all.

I try to rationalize it and offer that maybe being in the sun the day before had zapped him and he got kind of sunsick. Nope, they didn't acccept that answer because he isn't sunburnt. I just brushed it off again and he was obviously very tired. My mother in law just kept saying over and over that for a while now, something has been wrong with my son. She didn't explain how long she thought something was up and wasn't explaining exactly what was wrong, but something was wrong.

I brought my son home and he is as happy as ever, he ate a whole bunch like always, and is now napping happily after playing for a while. Everything is just like always. I know they are trying to fish for something wrong so they can blame it on him being vaccinated to prove to me that vaccines are pure evil. I also know if there is something wrong, its not because of vaccines because his last shots were on Thursday, only 4 days ago, and today was the first day they watched him since then, but everything was fine yesterday, so the likelihood of it being because of vaccines is slim. And before that, the last time he was vaccinated was a good two months before I started working again (was stay at home) and they had to watch him. And since they hardly spent much time with him before I got my job, they would have no way of knowing if something was off as soon as they started watching him.

This honestly makes me angry. She already seems to find little things wrong with him all the time and has done things like given him supplements (they are all about homeopathy) without consulting me first in her agenda to push their ""all natural is the only way"" way of thinking. She also jumped on me when she found out I have the mirena IUD after I had my son and am still breastfeeding him (excuse the fuck outta me for not wanting another baby while I'm literally still breastfeeding this one). Now everytime my son catches a cold, they will be jumping all over me about how I poisoned my son and caused it. Or I will do something to ""disrespect"" them (different story that I will post about sometime soon) and will use that as a way to tear me down by saying that I am purposely trying to kill my baby.

Now here is my question to y'all: What are some ways I can shut down these passive comments about something being wrong with my son? I don't want to be rude or anything because our finances partially rely on them for the free babysitting. How would y'all handle this or what would you say to your MIL?

Will be posting more soon, this is just what happened today.

Edit: DH and I are finally on the same page about vaccines and have come to a compromise. And he has agreed with me that ILs shouldn't know about any further vaccinations. He also has agreed not to share any info with MIL unless we both agree it is needed to be shared. Now just to figure out childcare and we will be set. Thank you whoever shared the website to help with childcare assistance.",JUSTNOMIL
" UPDATE: Lil Sis chickened out of previous plan, and then reconsidered, called the cops to pick her up, and checked herself into a psych ward for the weekend. She's sent me IG messages and said she's safe, but we're still working on getting her more safer. Relieved, stressed, all the emotions. 


TW: Suicide, Religious Abuse (not sure if this warrants TW but better safe than sorry)

I posted this on another sub, but I really need advice, and ya'll are great at it. So I (23F) have JustNoParents. Full nine yards, NMom (who I write about here as MaybeRabies, EDad. I am married, away, no-contact, and free. Hell, I live in a different COUNTRY. It's been nice... until now.

I have three younger siblings,

1. a 20F JustNoSis, who lives 20+hours away from MaybeRabies, and who may be bipolar, and who hates my husband. She also outed me as bisexual to our conservative-Christian-cult parents at Thanksgiving, and alluded to my then-fiance as a rapist. We don't talk.
2. I have a 8M brother who is the Golden Child, but who was also a 'whoops' child and parented by his siblings.
3. 17F little sister, who is an angel, video chats or texts me every day, and is essentially *The Forgotten One* to my parents.

Little sis has been the victim of increasingly sadistic behavior and MaybeRabies outbursts. MaybeRabies threatened to push her down the stairs a week ago. However much abuse she's received, most of it is emotional/mental/religious abuse, and local CPS won't intervene if there's not physical bruises. A saving grace is MaybeRabies (who is constantly sick/ill/injured) is currently for REAL-real laid up with a broken ankle, and that kinda limits her physical-violence potential. (and she has a lot of it, 100% spanked me mercilessly until at 17, when I physically threatened to attack her). And EDad, despite his anger issues, doesn't have the guts to actually even spank his kids, much less be physically abusive. 

Little sis is at the end of her rope, and doesn't turn 18 for another YEAR. Her senior prom was last night, and on the advice of her school counselor and school's dedicated officer, packed a bag and stowed it at a friend's, and planned to voluntarily commit herself to a psych ward (she is suicidal, and an admission sparks an investigation). She has her passport, her birth certificate, and she needs a new SSN. There was a teen home that would assist her with emancipation. I was helping find a room that she could afford. She's transferring at work. The parents track her phone (that she owns) so she was wiping it, ditching the SIM, and signing up for a prepaid plan. She was set to run away.

She went to a friend's house to prep for prom last night. She ended up chopping off her hair (our parents are in a religious cult that doesn't allow women to cut their hair, and the poor girl has hair that touched the ground). And the girl went to prom last night, had a great time, but then got picked up by the parental. She called me 5 times at 2am, (my phone died in the middle of the night) and when I responded at 5am, there was no answer. No one has seen or heard from her in the last 12+ hours. I've contacted her best friends on social media, my 20F JustNoSis contacted me, no one has heard anything.

I am worried as F&amp;CK and don't know what to do?!?! I would head down there, but I'm landing as an immigrant this week, and the government literally has my passport and I can't travel for the next three weeks until they MAIL IT BACK. I don't even know where to start, or what to do. I used to have cop friends (and regular friends) in the neighborhood, but everyone has moved. Please advise me.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi all, long time lurker, first time poster, all that jazz.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been following this sub for a while, mostly because it was incredibly reassuring to find out that I'm not alone in having family that makes me feel like I'm living in a nightmare at times, and this community seems incredibly supportive.  Until now, I've never really felt the need to post.  I apologize if this is long, but I feel the need to give some context to explain what led me to post today, because the actual encounter last night was ***very*** minor.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother is what I consider to be a JustNo.  We have never really been close, have often butted heads (though that's an incredible understatement of our relationship), and I've come to realize that she is emotionally manipulative and at times is emotionally and verbally abusive.  I suffer from anxiety and depression, which I'm trying to address through therapy.  As a family, we have gone through periods of separation and LC, and even periods of complete NC, and then have later reunited.  Having dealt with her behavior for over two decades at this point (it really started when I was a pre-teen), it's honestly become just the normal state of affairs for me.  

&amp;#x200B;

Some background:  A few years ago, I decided I was going to go to law school.  I decided to go full time, so I quit my job, and at my parents urging I let go of my apartment and moved home so that I could save money.  It turned out to be a very good decision in hindsight and on the balance.  While, it wasn't always perfect, and my mom and I fought, I had such long hours at school that we didn't often see each other, and I ended up graduating with high honors and got a great job that I love, so again...it paid off.  Now that I've graduated, I'm still at home.  We're working on selling the family home, and until then I'm living very cheaply (though I do pay rent) and am making enormous strides towards paying down my debts and building my savings.  On the other hand, I've put a lot of other things on hold, like dating.

&amp;#x200B;

Until yesterday, my mother has been living down in Florida.  She's a ""snowbird"" and goes down there from roughly October through June.  During this time, it's me and my dad in the home, and we coexist wonderfully.  We've always had a great relationship when my mother isn't around.  I had been facing the decision of whether I wanted to move out this summer, have been looking at apartments, and have been promised a good portion of the extra furniture in the home when I move (I virtually won't have to purchase anything in order to move, aside from some bookcases), since they're downsizing and can't take everything anyway.  There is an apartment that I can move into starting July 1st, if I wanted to.

&amp;#x200B;

However, recently I had been strongly considering staying in the home for another few months, since the house isn't selling and again, I'm saving a ton of money.   My father and I had talked, and he had promised me that he wouldn't let my mother yank the furniture away when she gets angry.  She has a tendency to forget her promises and use anything she can think of as a weapon, and not having to furnish an apartment is an enormous savings that I've been counting on for my budgeting, so her taking it away would vastly change the calculus of my decision.  He reasoned with me that she's only home until October, and we all have such busy schedules and multiple vacations planned, so we would barely see each other, so could I just consider staying home?  I should mention that they have been having financial troubles (though you wouldn't know it from how my mother likes to pretend her quality of life is), so though my rent is meager in comparison, it helps them a lot.  I love my father very much, and don't want to see him struggle more than he needs to, so I told him that I would consider it.  And I had been, I had pretty much convinced myself that it would be a smart financial decision to stay home for a bit longer, and that it wouldn't be that bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I alluded to earlier, she moved home yesterday.  She and my father drove home from Virginia, and got back around 6 pm.  I had been dreading it the whole day, but told myself that all we had to do was get through dinner, that they would both be tired and go to bed early, so it would be an easy start.  Until that point, I had already had a pretty bad day for other, totally unrelated reasons, so I wasn't really looking to engage in any meaningful way.

&amp;#x200B;

She walks in, and I'm upstairs, just having finished a shower.  I don't get a hello, or a ""we're home!"" or anything.  First thing she does is uncork the bottle of wine I had sitting on the counter.  So I come downstairs to say hello, and give her a kiss on the cheek.  After she says hello, she asks me when I bought the wine, because ""it was bad.""  Now, I had a glass the night before, it was certainly NOT bad, she just as a matter of course automatically finds fault with anything that I do, say, or buy.  Without fail.  I told her that I didn't remember exactly when I bought it (my days/weeks tend to blur together, and I have no head for dates or time), but that it wasn't bad, as I had drank some recently.  I then turned to say something to my father, who had just come in.  This ***very*** innocuous interaction was apparently enough to set off a powder keg.  I'm nasty, I'm ungrateful, I'm a liar, she won't deal with my behavior all summer, etc.  I looked at my dad, who just looked defeated, but agreed with her.  He has a strong tendency to cave into whatever she wants, and I get that he's been married to her for over 30 years, and that he has to live with her when I'm gone, and that he loves her, but it's made very clear to me that when she's home, I have no allies in the home, which really hurts and makes me feel very lonely.  I told both of them that I would be restarting my apartment search, declined to share dinner with them, and went upstairs and shut the door to my room.  

&amp;#x200B;

This morning, in response to her cheery ""Good morning sweetheart, how are you?"" I said nothing more than a quiet good morning when I saw her.  I can't play along and ride the roller coaster of her emotional games all summer.  Just because she's in a good mood this morning, I can't make that leap...my memory isn't THAT bad.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do.  Staying in the house all summer is going to be a constant case of walking on eggshells, it always is when she's home, you literally never know when something small will set her off like last night.  But at the same time, I don't think I can afford to move out AND purchase an entire apartment's worth of furniture this summer.  I doubt that if I told them tomorrow I had signed a lease she would let me take what I was promised.  I can even tell you what her ""reasons"" would be.  I know that I can survive a summer with her home, physically...I've done it before.  I may just try to stick it out, and be her tenant instead of her daughter.  Minimal engagement.  Kill her with stone wall type politeness.  At least when she's home I have a tendency to lose weight, haha.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know what kind of advice I'm looking for.  Maybe some confirmation that I'm not crazy, and that she in fact is a JN?  I have a strong tendency to gaslight myself, and convince myself after the fact that things aren't that bad.  I almost didn't write this in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I'm so sorry that this is so long...thanks to those who have made it this far.",JUSTNOMIL

I've been drafting a response for the past couple of weeks and I finally sent it. I've posted the text below. This was really hard for me to write because I've never been this direct with her before (although I recognize it's not exactly a badass hardline response). Just wanted to post here and see if there's messaging I could tighten up to help get through to her. Big thanks to  /u/[candycanekaz](https://www.reddit.com/user/candycanekaz) and /u/[Ellai15](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ellai15/) - you'll recognize a few of your suggestions were incorporated. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Hi Mom, 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry it's taken me a while to reply to you. I've been having a hard time finding the right words for what I want to say. I'll start with I love you too. It hurts me to see you feeling so hurt and lost, but I don't know how to respond to what you wrote about in your email about your feelings as a young mother, as a child of JNGM, or a wife to SD1. Those seem like topics that are out of my depth and would be more appropriate/productive to discuss with your therapist. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also want to get to a healthy place with you. I don't know what the right path forward is, but I think we should start by addressing more recent events. I want to at least share with you how I felt about Mother's Day weekend so we can be on the same page. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was excited about spending Mother's Day weekend with you and YB. At the same time, I feel that I was transparent with you that Friday would be difficult for me given how busy I have been at work. I have worked hard to get where I am professionally - I know you know this better than anyone - but in the moment, when you were trying to guilt me into ignoring my responsibilities and come have dinner with you instead, I felt like you didn't respect what I do. Or maybe didn't understand the pressures and expectations of what I do. I enjoy a good amount of flexibility in my role, but when there is a deadline I am expected to meet that deadline. This is what being a leader on my team means. And in my mind, sacrificing one dinner in order to spend the weekend clear of work distractions was a fair and reasonable ask. I'm 30 years old, and it felt infantilizing to have to justify to my mom that my work was important and couldn't be postponed. Then, I felt angry when you wanted me to drive out that same night after I finished working, even after I explained that I wouldn't finish until very late. I knew I would be exhausted and wouldn't want to drive an hour out to the AirBnB. It wouldn't have been safe to drive that far while that tired. You didn't seem to care. It felt like my health and safety didn't matter as much as sticking to your schedule did. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I didn't want to fight about any of that. I wanted to still enjoy Saturday and Sunday with you. So when I got to your AirBnb and found the kitchen a disaster, I just cleaned it up. I figured that we could get a fresh start on the weekend when you woke up. Instead, when you woke up you were determined to pick a fight even though I gave you several opportunities to change the course you were on before leaving. You blamed me for you drinking too much. You were offended I'd cleaned up after you. You brought up what I'd said about SD2 and tried to twist it into something ugly. You yelled increasingly more hateful things about me that seemed designed to get me to snap back. Can you understand how it feels to hear your mom scream these things at you? So I chose to leave rather than sit there and have insults thrown at me or sit there and throw insults right back at you. We've done that so many times before. I hate fighting like that, and it's never actually resolved anything.

&amp;#x200B;

I know you were disappointed that I couldn't go to dinner on Friday but your reaction to that disappointment was inappropriate and disproportionate. You wrote that you became disappointed when ""it was clear it \[a whole weekend together\] wasn't going to happen"" but your behavior on Saturday is what took that away. Can you acknowledge that? We had all day Saturday and all day Sunday ahead of us. If you had woken up on Saturday excited instead of angry things could have looked so different. Did you think us fighting on Saturday morning would have made the weekend better? Did you think I was going to want to spend time with you after hearing the hurtful things you had to say about me? And after all that, in your texts after the fact and this email, I've seen a lot of excuses and explanations and no apologies.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to be more honest with you going forward, because I don't think we can have a successful adult relationship any other way. 

&amp;#x200B;

It seems to me that many of the problems we have with each other are caused or exacerbated by alcohol as a common denominator. I found four empty bottles of wine in that kitchen, and I'm sure that you had a glass or two with dinner beforehand. That's not normal. I am worried about how you use alcohol to ""drown yourself"" or ""over indulge"". These are your words. And this pattern of emotional turmoil, binge drinking, then lashing out at your loved ones is becoming a disturbing pattern. Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm scared. I'd rather hurt your feelings now by saying these things and addressing them head on than potentially watch you end up like Grandpa \[note: Wino Rhino's dad was a Vietnam war vet and drank himself to death\]. I love you too much to let that even be a remote possibility. So I'm asking you to talk about your relationship with alcohol with SD2, or Aunt 1, or Aunt 2, or your therapist, just anyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

The mother I need is just a mother who is happy and healthy, that's it. I want to be supportive of you getting there, and I will continue to do my best to do that, but I am still just your daughter and there's a lot that I can't solve for you. I am also going to continue to disengage if you persist in behavior that is dysfunctional or hurtful towards me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry this is so long.

"Trigger warning: animal cruelty, abuse and death. Like some grotesque things are going to be said and if you love animals you should really move to another area. It's bad.

This is just no mil but I put why I did divorce because my ex was entirely dependent on his mother as a conscience. He at one point literally said to me ""I don't know right from wrong without my mom. This is a driving factor in why I did divorce. She's a good Christian woman you see?

I started to suspect something was dreadfully wrong with the entire family tree when his parental units abandoned two dogs to the north Idaho wilderness so they wouldn't have two large dogs in the city. I only heard about this, but it made me shudder because even big dogs can't fight off wolves, bears, and moose. I thought perhaps it was an exaggeration - they were good Christians and they did bring their house dog.

I later found out definitively that Lots Wife only likes animals when they aren't inconvenient. That house dog? When it started having accidents on her perfect carpet, she stuck it in a plastic tub of dry ice. No, I'm not kidding. She made all the noises that the poor little dog was going to have to be euthanized anyway, because the kidneys were going and the medication was too expensive.  (They always had money and quite a lot of it, I guess this shows the wealthy do pinch pennies.)

Later on LW was soooo upset about her dog's ""passing"" she basically stole my ex SIL's dog. A notoriously obedient breed LW would play fetch with that pupper until it dropped from exhaustion and its gums bled (prior tooth extraction because pupper was older).  Eventually SILs dog couldn't play anymore (hips, teeth, older) and SIL had to come rescue the poor baby. LW basically yelled at her own daughter for ""forcing ME to take care of a defective animal"".

I have never told anyone this... I feel guilty by association just having heard about it. She was proud of putting down her own dog. The only thing that is heresy is whether or not she released her first dogs into the wilds. This contributed in large part to divorce from my ex because he has the same attitude about animals - great until they inconvenience you. Well, and the abuse and threats but I think the attitude is animals and property and I was property.",JUSTNOMIL
"TL;dr Grandma has passed. I am somehow inheriting some money. MIL somehow turned into a banshee. I don’t know if I’ll keep posting but writing this was therapeutic. I’m sorry that it is so long.

TW: Death, and my very depressing self. I am sorry in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks ago, we lost an amazing soul. I wish I could tell you it was a happier ending and that she won it big at the casino. But life sometimes isn’t so great or picture perfect.

&amp;#x200B;

Grandma had another slip/fall. Nothing was broken but she just couldn’t get up. Her back started to spike in pain and it was unbearable for her. We spoke with our palliative nurse and she suggested a higher dosage of painkillers, morphine to be exact.

&amp;#x200B;

Every 2 hours Grandma needed the morphine pill and basically, she became bedridden and unable to walk at all. I got her a wheelchair and she weighed less than a feather. We watched Animal Planet and the Great British Baking Show. I took her grocery shopping to get some more fuzzy blankets that she loved. I thought things were looking up. I thought for sure we were headed to the casino soon and I’d get to wheel her around like the queen she is.

&amp;#x200B;

One night she just would not wake up for her pills or anything, so I got worried and called the nurse again. She came and ran some tests and told me that it wasn’t looking good and that her liver was beginning to decline. I called up FMIL to let her know to come and say goodbyes. I called family and everyone in her little phone book letting them know. I can’t remember what time it was I just knew that it was late, and I felt numb.

&amp;#x200B;

Nobody came for her. Not a single soul from her phone book was able to come. MIL responded that she would just come in the morning. I texted back that she may not have that long and I really think she should come NOW. MIL said I was being dramatic and needed to go get some sleep and that her mother would be fine. I just don’t understand how you can just ignore … this. FDH was at work and was trying to get someone to come cover his shift so he could come. He didn’t make it.

&amp;#x200B;

The nurse left and told me to call when the time came. My heart was breaking. I couldn’t remember the cookie recipe she gave me. I had so many questions and conversations I wanted to have with her. I knew we didn’t have long but I guess a part of me was hoping I’d have more. I just talked at her for a few hours. I talked about how much I appreciated her and how much she would be missed in my life. I asked her to send me a rainbow on my birthday (It always rains on my birthday). I don’t know why but I sent a prayer for her and I don’t really have a religion.

&amp;#x200B;

At some point of talking to her I just told her that she was such a light in my life and I wanted her to know that I loved her. I loved her like a grandma I never got to have, and I was so grateful to have her for such an amazing ride. And I told her I was sorry the casino was so far away.

&amp;#x200B;

I drifted asleep at her bedside and the next moment she was gone. By the time FDH got there I was just sitting there. He called the nurse and started getting her things in order. She was taken to her funeral home pretty much instantly and was cremated.

&amp;#x200B;

FDH calls his mother and of course she doesn’t answer. He leaves a message to call him and that grandma has passed away and that I could use some support. She sends me a text at 9:19am to send her the will so she can be the executor of the will.

I texted back “I am grieving the loss of one my closest friends. I am grieving YOUR mother MIL. The only thing you have to say is “Where is the will?””

She texted back that she was sad too but we all knew this was coming.

I told her that the estate lawyer has the will and that he is the executor and then I gave her the lawyers phone number. I turned off my phone and had a really long cry.

&amp;#x200B;

FDH helped me get cleaned up and sort myself. He didn’t cry until later that day where it set in. We cried together and cuddled for awhile

Moving on, a couple days later after the cremation there is the reading of the will and what not. I attend because I wanted to know where they were going to put grandma.

&amp;#x200B;

This crazy lovable cookie monster left me her life insurance. Apparently, she had it never thought to mention it. I guess MIL was right in a way, grandma had money, but she couldn’t spend it. She left me a letter and god it made me cry.

She called me and angel, a warrior, and a feisty little dumpling. She thanked me for everything and for being her savior in the time of need. She said breaking a hip was the best thing that has ever happened to her.

&amp;#x200B;

I can’t tell you how much I cried and how much I am crying.

&amp;#x200B;

FMIL was left her collection of fuzzy socks and her collection of crystal figurines. The rest of her “estate” aka the storage unit was to be split among her children any way as long as they all agreed that it was a fair split.

&amp;#x200B;

When FMIL heard I was getting the money she started screaming. Not even words just guttural screams. She screamed that I must have written this will and that there is no way her own MOTHER would give money to some unrelated chink.

&amp;#x200B;

FDH decided that was enough and stood up. We basically left without acknowledging the banshee that she had become. I was too busy crying over her letter. I wish I could go back and call FMIL exactly what she deserves but I am not superwoman. I cried and snottily told her to fuck off.

&amp;#x200B;

Jumping to now, FDH has moved in with me after the fiasco of his mother screaming and the money is in a trust. FMIL is trying to find a lawyer to sue to get the money but I guess the estate lawyer was telling me that it was an open and shut case and she wouldn’t have much to stand on especially since I took care of Grandma and she was clearly estranged.

&amp;#x200B;

FMIL tried to say that she needed access to my apartment to collect all of her “inheritance” but I had FDH, the estate lawyer, and PD that I was friends with via work with standing with me. Overkill? Yes. But I was very vulnerable, and I didn’t know if I could stand up to her at the moment. She tried taking MY fuzzy blankets and I put my foot down. I had receipts for those damn elephant blankets and they were for grandma. I will be dragged to hell in a gasoline-soaked burlap sack before I let her take any of MY gifts to grandma.

&amp;#x200B;

She left once she realized she wasn’t going to get anything. She certainly tried.

It has been an exhausting and sad month.

Edit: Thank you all for your incredible support. I don't really have the words to say it but I don't know if I can drink enough water to cry as  much as I have. 

Additional information: Grandma's recipe book has been located and yes I have the cookie recipe. It may be a very long time before I bake.

I read all comments and I do want to respond to all of them but I am really mentally exhausted and I apologize if I cannot manage. Thank you so much. I don't know how to express it more but thank you.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hello Reddit,

I have always known my mother as the lying-type. She is a bad/misguided person.

Anyways, She found someone on a dating site, and she plans to marry him. She wants to move in to his house in Texas, but he doesn’t like animals. This had me very worried, because I have a pet bird.
She told me that my bird was ill, and had to be taken to a clinic. She also told me that the bird had to stay there a while. This had me very skeptical, so I talked to her about it, but she didn’t tell me anything.
Today, I got sick and tired of all the lying, so I went to go find the truth. I snuck onto my mothers phone while she was mowing the lawn, and I checked her messages. She texted him, saying that she “dropped the bird off at the airport to some lady”, I was worried about my bird, so I dug deeper into her messages. She also texted a lady, who had sent pictures of my bird. Apparently, my mom gave my bird to a lady, and faked his death, so she could move in with her future husband.

I confronted her about my bird being at the clinic for a long time, (not letting her know what I had found),And she told me that my bird had died during surgery. I knew this was a lie, so I started to poke at her, trying to get her to admit it, but she started crying a lot, which made me believe that my bird had actually died.

The evidence is right before me, proving that my mother is lying, but she seemed so genuine in her crying, or she is a great lier. 
I am devastated and torn over this, and I feel like my life is falling apart. 

Summary: My mom faked my birds death, to move into her future husbands house, but before my mom told me about the death, I discovered that it was a lie.

* I have to move in with a stepdad and stepbrother

*I have to go to a new highschool

*I have to live with a lying mother

I just feel overwhelmed, and I miss my bird.
I remember we bought that bird because I was depressed, and it brought me out of depression.
I feel lost without it.

Should I leave when Im 18?
Should I confront her about the truth?
Should I get my bird back?


(Also, I know its wrong to look into other peoples messages, but I wanted to know the truth. I had a strong instinct and I believe that the universe was trying to warn me about her lies. Also, sorry if his was hard to read or just unorganized. I don’t use reddit much, but I have nowhere else to go)",JUSTNOMIL
"My hubby and I have been together 19 years and married for 11. We moved 990 miles away from our families in 2002 but moved just 350 miles away in 2010. I honestly missed everyone. Things were great I went to visit then whenever I wished and occasionally they would visit us, with notice. That is till last year. It our 10th wedding anniversary.  I got off work but my hubby wasn't able to. He surprised me the night before telling me he was off. We were going to get to spend the whole day together.  Nothing fancy just together.   We started the day grocery shopping. We also bought new cell phones as our gift to each other. We just started shopping when my mother called to wish us happy anniversary and asked what we were doing. I told her we just started shopping and I'd call her back. We finish shopping and head to checkout.  We walk past the entrance to hear someone singing ""happy anniversary."" See my mom and stepfather strolling in singing to us. I laugh a little then tears start trickling down my cheeks. I usually cry when I laugh but I wasn't laughing. She thought I was. When she saw my hubby she looked disappointed and said she thought he would be working. I told her he got off to surprise me. She said oh well we wanted to take you out to eat, I guess he's welcome. They needed some things from the store so we would meet at her favorite pizza place for lunch in a few minutes.  Hubby and I get out to the car and I'm in shock. Of all the days they could surprise me, why on our anniversary.  We get to the pizza shop and and before they show  we both wonder if she'll make us pay. That's  her MO, she invites us places then can't pay sticking us with the bill.  To our surprise she does pay and we head to our house. On the way we notice our new phones aren't working so I call her and let her know we were headed back to the phone store for help. They can go to the house. Well 2 hours later we get home. Phone people are worthless but that's another story. As soon as we walk in the door my mom gets this indignant look on her faces and tells my husband thanks for not letting me spend time with my daughter. I told her it wasn't his fault. We had trouble with the new phones. So my husband gets mad and says he'll be back for supper and leaves. So I'm stuck alone with my mom and irritating stepdad for my anniversary.  She of course is glad my hubby's gone and acts like things couldn't be better. So later we're all at supper and my mom informs us that they are staying at a hotel so we can and I quote...""bowchickywowwow"" in privacy.  If we hadn't been in a packed restaurant I would have told her that's not bloody likely after spending our anniversary separately and with them but I let it go. She did pay for supper as well which shocked us.  So we parted ways with them and I guess in the future I'll have to lay down some rules about our anniversary for her.",JUSTNOMIL
" 

Firstly thank you for all the advice you all have me on my last post. The situation is being handled but I can't speak about it more than that.

I still have more stories about my mother (mostly BEC) but today I am going to share one from my best friend who currently lives with my family as my ""adopted sister."" She will be otherwise known as AS (adopted sister) from here on out as she lives with us and has been taken in as family.

There is a lot of backstory that my AS wishes to either type up herself or keep private for the moment, so this is only a starter story for now. AS requested me to type this lighter fluffy story up, since I have been known to be blunter about her parents and their antics and I agreed as I have been trying to drag her out of the FOG since we met in college (she has read and approved this story). Mods please let me know if this is ok. If it isn't, I'll work with her so she can post them herself on her own account.

Relevant Backstory: AS grew up as the only child in an extremely controlling household with two separate forms of narcissist, one in either parent. FIL is the aggressive, loud obviously abusive form, while MIL is far more sinister and not as noticeable. She is quieter, colder and uses weaponized forms of her emotions, particularly sadness or affection/love, to control her targets. Her main target is AS, and MIL has an obsession with controlling AS. Part of this control was maintaining infantilization and enforced helplessness in AS; keeping AS dependant on her. This meant that: 

* AS was only given clothing of her mother's choice, and was she dressed by her mother. This also extended to her hair; AS was not allowed to fashion it anyway which her mother did not find pleasing.
* AS could only participate in activities in which her mother or occasionally father approved of.
* As was not taught how to clean or cook, and often was berated for doing things incorrectly; effectively chasing her away from taking care of the hoarding house. This unfortunately included not being taught how to care for herself in most hygienic fashions.
* AS was isolated with little to no human interaction, asides from school and events chaperoned or pre-screened by one or both parents.
* AS faced the systematic sabotaging of anything that would result in independence. 

And yes this control includes maintaining an ironclad grip on AS' money.

From an early age AS had been requested to provide money towards MIL needs, always with the promise of repayment, without FIL’s knowledge. When AS would ask for the money back, she was met with reactions in the gist of: ""I bathed you, fed you, gave you everything that you could ever ask for. You're my daughter, you owe us for raising you. We bought you all of these nice things, so how could you treat US like this-"" and so forth.

But it doesn't stop there. When MIL wasn't recieiving enough money to feed her insatiable hoarding habit, AS found that her money would go missing under mysterious circumstances. This ranged from 500 dollars drained from her joint account with MIL, to money kept hidden in AS’ room/couch going missing.

In total AS lost around 1800 dollars while living with her parents due to the demands and MIL's straight up thievery. This was also without AS having a job as MIL couldn't fathom her baby girl leaving the nest. So all of this stolen or borrowed money was from gifts from family and friends; she had been slowly been bled dry over her lifetime. All before the age of 18.

At 18 AS came to my state for college, and we met in freshman year, eventually living together on campus for several years. In those years AS began to become more independent. She didn't have MIL to clean for her, or tell her what to do everyday or to harass her for what she was doing. She had friends who began to point out calling her parents everyday wasn't normal.That the stories that she would tell weren’t the typical family drama. Who loved and pushed her into learning skills and encouraging her to flourish. And as to this posts actual story, we encouraged her love of cooking.

You see, despite AS never having been allowed to cook at home, once she started at the apartment like dorm, she found she adored it. Especially baking or more complicated meals. But she still was in the fog, so she still wanted her mother to be impressed. So when she came to me with the idea for cooking for MIL during a visit, in which MIL was supposed to return 300 dollars that had been borrowed, I reluctantly agreed. I knew at that moment that MIL would try to ruin it. And oh boy. I was not disappointed.

The first thing MIL did upon entering our dorm/apartment was begin to clean, wiping down counters and doing dishes all the while shooing AS away like a child, scolding her for leaving a mess; aka pans in the sink that had been used to prep the meal. 

Now AS being a sweetie bought some wine that her mother was known for enjoying. She unfortunately forgot the corkscrew so MIL took over relishing the temptation of taking care of her helpless daughter, grabbing scissors to pop it open. Shockingly /s, MIL had no idea how to actually pop it open, mangling the cork in her attempts to get it out. AS attempted to take it away from her mother so she could try but MIL yanked it away snapping, ""If I can't do it- you certainly can't.""

At this point I was frustrated with the whole situation and took it away from MIL with a strained smile fiddled for three seconds before handing it to AS. MIL popped her mouth to whine and claim some absurd thing just as AS popped the cork out. The CBF was great, MIL grumbling something about how she didn't even want to drink and didn't think AS should either.

Now as for me? I'm an awful influence according to MIL and FIL and took a full glass despite hating wine. I needed it to keep cool and not verbally whip this woman a new one. So I began to cheerfully drink the rotten grape juice just to get that sweet relief and calm my temper.

We make it to dinner, which myself and AS had worked on since early in the morning. It was parmesan chicken with homemade garlic bread; made with care and consideration. I don't mean to brag but it was perfect. Crispy breading, moist chicken, tangy and flavorful homemade tomato sauce,  and slightly toasted mozzarella and parmesan on top. I mean amazing. AS and I eat our fill and we were feeling good about the meal. MIL only takes a couple bites and continues to CBF, placing the plate down and not touching it. AS, the ever hopeful woman that she is, asked MIL how it was. As if sensing how much it meant to AS, she dismissively mutters, ""Eh... Not the worst I've ever had."" and proceeded to throw the plate of food away, before heading to the kitchen to clean up AGAIN. AS looked crushed, and I drain my cup of pacifying juice.

But AS puts on a brave face and ignores it. She chatters with her mother as the self-absorbed she demon inserts herself into the kitchen, cleaning up everything and reorganizing the space like a tornado of idiotic righteousness. And then AS does the unforgivable, and asks about the 300 she is owed. MIL turns with a laugh, nonchalant as can be and smugly decreed ""I'm your mother I don't owe you nothing.""

And that was enough for me. ""Excuse me?"" I snapped sitting straight up, completely aghast. I stared at her with a very WTF look, brows raised as I wait for an answer. MIL seemed taken aback by my sudden attention and focus and only in that instant realized I didn't approve of that bullshit line of thinking. Like any narcissist with an image problem, she began to stammer some excuse that wasn't important at the time. I gave her an unamused stare and returned to drinking my new glass, now with a scowl. The visit didn't last long past that. MIL left, having infantilized and demeaned AS the entire time. And the worst part was AS wasn't even surprised.

There are probably going to be more stories after this so a name might be needed. AS likes the name Blue Diamond for the Steven Universe character who uses her powers to emotionally manipulate and hurt others into feeling exactly what she wants as well as other reasons that will be detailed in later stories. I personally feel she is more of White Diamond playing Blue, but the name suits her sobbing when AS tries. If anyone has any ideas please let us know.",JUSTNOMIL
"My extremely JN Mom (Gone Fishing) has reached a new low. I have been NC with her since August 2018 due to her narcissistic, selfish, lying, awful behavior but now she has gone farther than she has before. I still talk to my dad when I can but she frequently blocks my number on his phone so he doesn't realize it til I say something to him on Facebook or so.  Well same thing happened where i realized I was blocked so I messaged him on Facebook.

&amp;#x200B;

He sent me a text saying that he now has a new number and GF had him arrested. He said GF and him got in an argument (which is pretty much always) and this time she attacked him. He sent me pictures and he is scratched up like crazy. Well dad left the house and she called the police literally HOURS later and told them he punched her in the jaw. SO dad got arrested while he was in a motel for the night and what does GF do. She makes my YS drive her to the motel and GF takes my dads car and parks it in their garage at home knowing he won't be allowed to go near the house and  get the car until the TRO is lifted next week.

&amp;#x200B;

This was 100% a power play. My dad does not get physical with anybody. He is a big teddy bear. Dad works a very important job which he could lose literally everything for if he gets convicted for this shit. Dad is also much larger than GF so he knows the implications if she says he attacked her which is exactly why she is saying this.

&amp;#x200B;

Please do not attack the cops for this GF is a master manipulator to the extreme and she can convince anybody she is in the right. I am sure whatever picture she painted made her seem like 100% the victim here so the cops had to go off of the 51% that he did. He is out of jail now but now his job, his , livelihood, and his reputation are on the line because GF did not get what she wanted or she is using this to get something she wants.

&amp;#x200B;

My main concern is my YS though because she witnessed it all. GF has had me and my all of my OSs' lie to cops and CPS multiple times over much smaller things and I am afraid she is making YS do the same for this. I can't get a hold of YS and dad said GF is making YS's life hell over this.  I am already planning on talking to dad's attorney about the past abuse and how she made us lie and so are my OSs' so we have that front covered. If I manage to talk to YS I am already planning on recording the call so no worries there. I just hate GF and she is so so so so dead to me now.  This also isn't the first time she is accusing people of abuse. She accused my FDH of beating me and if he has not already then he will soon so I know she is full of shit and wants attention from this all. I just really needed to rant because I'm so angry right now",JUSTNOMIL
"Hey guys,I originally posted this in /r/raisedbynarcissists and they directed me to this subredditSo my wife and I have been together for nearly 12 years. When we first started dating, I had noticed that her mother was a bit over-bearing and controlling but didn't think much of it. They seemed to have an OK relationship but not your typical mother / daughter relationship (shopping / gossiping etc). My MiL has never pulled her own weight.. After she divorced my FiL when my wife was little she married a man 20 years older than her that was loaded and she goes to work at his company when she feels like it. She's constantly holding how much of her husbands money she has spent to raise my wife and her sister over their heads to the point of actually itemizing how much it cost to raise them.My wife is a textbook golden child to her. Since she was very little she would constantly talk about her sister to her as if she was a terrible child and pit them against each other (which she still does). She constantly bashes my sister in law to my wife in an effort to keep them distant.. However, now that they are older, my SiL and wife have seen through her manipulation and have begun to discuss the mental and physical abuse they went through from MiL their entire lives. From being told that they are ruining her dating life, to telling them that she wished they were never born, neglecting them emotionally and beating them when she would get drunk and lose her temper.Since I've been in the picture, she has been relatively tame and everyone walks on egg shells around her. For 12 years it has been a ticking time bomb, which finally blew up this year.My wife and I live several states away from MiL and welcomed our first child into the world last year. MiL has been obsessed with social media and is constantly bugging me and wife for photos so that she can post them to instagram and facebook. After Easter, she decided to come up for an entire week to ""help"" take care of her while her daycare was closed for spring break. Towards the end of the week, my wife made a comment about how tired our daughter seemed that week since her routine had been broken. MiL took this as a personal attack against her and started to behave strangely before she left. I had noticed that she seemed to be pilled out (anxiety meds) but chalked it up to her being nervous away from home in a big city.A few days after she returned home she began texting my wife, berating her for the comment and pitying herself (Im such a terrible grandparent aren't I?) etc. My wife started off by ignoring the outburst (as she always has done). When MiL realized she wasn't getting the reaction she wanted out of my wife she started with the small threats. My wife has been on their family cell phone plan since before we met and MiL began threatening to ""have her phone shut off"". I realized that this was a mistake to have my wife still on her plan and that she shouldn't have that sort of power over her so I put her on my plan and bought her a new phone. This only made matters worse. When we contacted MiL and told her that we were sending wife's phone back to her she began telling my wife that she was going to remove her from her will. We just said OK and that was that. Mother's Day came along and of course that was a shit show. It was my wife's very first mother's day and MiL of course began blowing up her phone. My wife answered the phone that night and the gaslighting began. MiL wanted to pretend that none of this had happened and made my wife feel stupid for bringing any of this up. Wife begged for her to talk about it but she refused to do so in a mature manner.. rather she just continued the self pity and the ""things I have done for you"" crap. After that conversation, my wife told her that there would be no contact until she wanted to talk about this like adults.A few days later, my Sister in Law sent MiL an ultimatum that she would not be letting her children visit their grandma any more until she went to rehab / got professional help for her psychological disorders. No response.Instead she resorted to social media to cry about and post pictures of her grandchildren saying things like ""my daughters are using them as cards in their drama"" etc PUBLICLY for everyone to see. She has berated me on social media accusing me of being a whipped puppy for my wife for not sending her photos of my daughter. It actually sickens me to think she wants to use her that way... to garnish even more sympathy.She has been begging other family members to send them photos of her grandchildren; lying and telling them that her daughters have stopped talking to her because she ""cut them off"" financially, which couldn't be any further from the truth. I have family and friends that follow her on social media and this is the only story they are getting. She has successfully turned some of my wife's oldest friends against her because of it.

I can't help but think that this situation is only going to get worse. I fear that she is going to pull something even crazier by either stalking us or submitting false reports to CPS to intimidate us. I'm not sure what to do at this point. Everything inside of me is telling me to call her and scream at her but I know that will do nothing but give her more reason to feel sorry for herself. We just want to cut her out of our lives and move on for good but this behavior has me really concerned that we haven't seen the worst of this.

Has anyone else had something similar happen to them with an N-Parent that feels entitled to a relationship with their grandchildren? What did you do about it? How will I be able to explain to my daughter in the future why her mom's mom is no longer in the picture and what do I do if MiL undermines everything (which she undoubtedly will) and tries to contact her directly when she is older? She has already attempted this with her oldest grandchild (10 years old). What's the best course of action to take when the MiL is airing her dirty laundry publicly and turning people against us? I don't want to stoop to her level but I feel like she needs to be exposed somehow before this gets worse.

Thank you for any insight and if you made it this far into the story I truly appreciate your time.

"More antics of my mother trying to create some drama where there is absolutely none. Wronged by everyone. Extreme martyr syndrome. 

This happened probably 2 years ago. I am on mobile. There is a TLDR at the bottom.

So in past stories I named her the Eternal Victim, and as a fellow redditor pointed out, it can double for Emotional Vampire, which is also appropriate.

Btw thank you for letting me get this off my chest, this has been an amazing form of therapy.

So. EV was over for a visit. At this time I was pregnant with my third baby. I am a bit more on edge and extremely tired when pregnant and honestly I don’t like people too much, so I realize I have some part in this because I more annoyed then usual. But my mother wanted to see the kids so I let her visit for a weekend.

When she visits her version of “helping” is putting the dishes in the dishwasher after I’ve cooked everything and sitting on her butt on the porch and chain smoking and “watching” the kids. 

Well she broke at least one dish every time she “helped”, so I calmly and politely no more help thanks, I like loading my own dishwasher. 

So out she goes to chain smoke on the porch. 
I hear someone yelling outside while I’m cleaning so I go out to see what the problem is, my middle daughter is covered in mud, up to her elbows and wants her hands washed and EV is just having a freaking fit. like why? My kids love playing in mud, but she is completely OCD and haaates dirt. So she’s freaking out yelling and my youngest is getting upset and I’m getting upset so I just pick up my kid and carry her to the bathtub to clean off. Daughter then sets herself up in her bed to snuggle and look at books. 

This was apparently not an ok thing to do.

EV follows me into the kitchen afterwords and proceeds to stand in the middle of the kitchen while I am walking back and forth trying to clean and move things.
She’s telling me that she “could of handled that” and “why did I just take away daughter, she was *helping* “ how? By yelling at her about some mud? I didn’t argue I just said ok let’s talk later I’m busy cleaning and avoided eye contact while I went back and forth because she always gives me these sappy looks like I broke her heart. She kept side stepping me because she was in THE MIDDLE OF THE FREAKING KITCHEN. 

She throws her hands up in the air and sighs loudly, walks back outside and has a few more cigarettes. 

5 minutes later I hear the door open again and I feel that anxiety in my chest like fuck here we go let’s argue about actual bullshit once again.

EV: you know turquoise pizza I feel like you don’t even want me here!

I am still trying to clean and she goes back to middle of the ducking kitchen completely in the flipping way of everything I do.

Me: mom it’s not that, I’m just trying to clean up

EV: I just want to talk! 

Me: about what?! I’m cleaning right now can it please wait?

EV: no I was taking care of (daughter) and you shouldn’t have just taken her away like that!

Me: you were upsetting her. She just needed to be cleaned off

EV: FINE! 

She walks back out. 
And 5 minutes later the door opens again (I wonder why I developed anxiety as an adult?)
She stands back in the EXACT SAME SPOT WHERE SHE KEEPS HAVING TO SIDESTEP BECAUSE I AM CLEANING. (There is tons of other places to sit/stand just btw)

EV is now crying: turquoise pizza I feel like you don’t even want me here

Me: I just told you that’s not true mom

EV: sometimes I just feel useless like I’m just feel like I’m just in your way!!

Me *i start to lose my mind at this point* : well you kind of are in the way right now, You are standing exactly in the middle of the kitchen while I’m cleaning (I saw this very calmly, not yelling at all)

EV BURSTS into full out sobs and runs downstairs to call family member to come and pick her up because I am “being mean” and “screaming at her” (everyone is always screaming at her apparently lol)

TLDR: my mother is upset that I have handled a situation that she wanted to handle and tries several times to start an argument about something completely different because while I am cleaning up and purposely tries to piss me off by standing in the way. She finally gets what she wants and I say something rude to her to she can go off and bitch to everyone else.",JUSTNOMIL
"My husband and I have been together three years (married for two). I have stopped speaking altogether to his mother for about three months: blocked her from all social media, her phone number, etc. I had many reasons to do this, and I could write a book about the idiotic/rude/narcissistic things she's done to lead me to that decision. The primary reason is that she is incapable of dealing with confrontation and having a conversation when she has offended me and my family. She refuses to talk or turns the conversation into me being a horrible person, or she just hangs up the phone. 

Regardless, I'd love to hear from anyone else who have blocked out their MIL or FIL or in-laws in general. Has it caused any strife between you and your SO? Do you ever hope to or plan to reconnect with them in the future (or is it conditional)?",JUSTNOMIL
"So, things have been ok. DH and I are seriously looking at houses and are sure we will find our house soon, and we'll be out of this place. THANK GOD. 

The issue today was that SIL went with DH and I to church and I happened to mention it to BIL within proximity of Mother Hen. The church we go to is one that Mother Hen does not approve of (which is hilarious because she's uber christian and won't go to church because none of the churches in our area agree with her way of thinking\\interpretation of scripture, but she'll post on FB all day long with christian posts and paraphernalia ) and then SIL mentioned what the sermon had been about. 

Mother Hen instantly pounced on it, needing justification for EVERY THING and making a CBF the entire time. DH sat there with her going back and forth having to explain and justify everything for about 10 minutes straight while I was just sinking lower into the couch.

Thankfully Mother Hen left to do errands a little while later and DH and I talked for a few minutes about it. We both feel like we can't talk around Mother Hen without getting into an argument. We can't be open and honest about anything, and therefore, can't have a good relationship with her.

"Hey hey hey,

Long time no chat. The really hasn't been much to report on the Fake British Feminist front because mostly we've been ignoring and the stuff that has been happening has been with other relatives but to give the cliff notes version, my husband and I told one of his uncles and gave him an exact list of everything she needed to apologize for and we said basically to semi quote Yoda, do or do not do, there is no try. We were just like at this point ,she either does or she doesn't and she's free to not do it but without apologizing for all these things there is no talking from DH. I am never speaking to FBF again and my husband backs me up 1000% 

Now that I have you all up to speed I got this in the email from her today and I will note that she sent it to both myself and my husband because you know I'm not an individual according to her and I would like y'alls translation. My husband was pretty much just like well there's no apology in there. Anyway here's what she wrote:

""Dear myprivatethought, I feel very sad about the fact that you feel so hurt and persecuted . I have never intended to do anything harmful to you and i deed wanted to welcome you into the family.

"I posted here multiple times, a while ago, when I was trying to get a handle on the JNILs I deal with. I went NC, and they did respect it for almost a year now. 

Now, they are visiting us (we live in different countries, thank god!), and already 2 days in shit is hitting the fan. 

I am away on a work/training trip, so the timing of their trip was useful. But in the 12 hours I’ve been gone: 

- FIL fought with DH when DH gave him some driving suggestions (FIL was underspeeding). FIL now claims he will not drive our car, and will instead uber everywhere. 

- ILs already want to do daycare drop-off and pick-up, so they plan to do that on uber. But now claim DH needs “summer vacation” and maybe he doesn’t need to go to daycare after all. 

- DS has been dosed with vicks and been declared “sick” (he has sniffles from daycare and has had status quo for a month +, not an actual cold/fever)

- There have been multiple fights about feeding DS. They aren’t happy with the quantity DS eats, and that he won’t eat veggies. 

And I am not even THERE to do anything. If this training was any less important, I would have cancelled it and stayed home, because I don’t trust them to handle DS - they will keep him safe, etc., but not respect any of my rules (esp. re overfeeding DS and stuffing food down his throat). 

Please tell me I’m not a terrible mum for coming here on work! 

At least DH is realising they are unreasonable and that they act like teenagers when things don’t go their way.)

UPDATE: FIL dropped DS at daycare (an hour later than usual, as we agreed) and in our car with the carseat DH installed. I guess this is a win? Let’s see what else they throw at us in the next month!",JUSTNOMIL
"Mrs Cockblockerson loves to gossip and blab about everyone and everything in her life. You accidentally let on a tiny piece of personal information and she will have extrapolated it six ways and her Just No sister, AIL ~~Aunt Catherine~~, is always happy to help.


AIL ~~Aunt Catherine~~ is in her own fantasies a dead ringer for Lady Catherine d'Burgh, in reality is far too close a caricature for the comfort of many. AIL approves of few people and likes even fewer. 


AIL ~~Aunt Catherine~~ does not aporove of me as I occupy far too much of her nephew's attention and she's ""sick of us going around in love not noticing anyone else."" 


How do you know you're a tried and true narcissist? You throw a tantrum because your nephew and his intended love each other ""too much"".


Anyway, this story is not about AIL ~~Aunt Catherine~~, but she does play a big role in how I was recieved, well not recieved, by my future MIL. 


I met AIL ~~Aunt Catherine~~ and her husband, who is far too delightful to come up in any of these stories, in a trip with my husband to their home. Uncle and I got on splendidly. I was due to visit now MIL then boyfriend's mother and father a few months later. My husband and I had been dating for a few months only but it was pretty obvious from the start we were getting aling very well and had a good probability of getting married down the line. It was like we'd known each other forever, we just clicked instantly.  


To note nether of us had discussed marraige as we'd only been dating for a few months. My mom had made a few comments about me finding a ""man to take care of me"" and I shut that right down because that is psychotic and I can care for myself. 


AIL ~~Aunt Catherine~~ did not approve of our relationship and on the last morning of our trip took my beau aside to tell him: 


* I would not be meeting his mother

* I would not going to his brother's wedding next year 

* He absolutely would not be asking me to marry him. 


And not to worry, she'd already informed his mother of this. 


AIL, uncle, now husband and I met for lunch and went to a juried art festival that afternoon as planned. My normally very calm beau was seething. After taking some time to calm down he explained the events I'd not been privy to earlier in the day. 


And he took me to look at wedding rings. 


I'm fairly certain that this is what prompted Mrs Cockblockerson to show so much disdain for me. She likes to try and get other family members ""on her side"" but that's never worked for her. But it almost did one time.


You know how gossipy women try to get other women to hate people they haven't met. Telling tall tales and outright lies... if you find the right person they'll get right down in the muck with you and start slinging blindly. 


After church we were leaving the pews and had stopped to chat. The Mrs brought a bitter looking middle aged woman over to meet me. She instantly had an attitude as though I owed her something, and introduces herself as my husband's cousin as though some major slight has occurred. 


Well.. we eloped so it couldn't be the fact you weren't at the wedding. If you didn't get a wedding announcement five years ago, well that's on Mrs Cockblockerson as she refused to send any announcements for any of her children and just gave us cards enough for their side of the family and a list of intended recipients. I didn't have a shower nor did we have an engagement party for the [same reasons that we eloped](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YxYvzVxJtYM). 


In the middle of trying to be polite to this crazy woman and figure out what her deal is my husband finishes his conversation and walks back over, along with his brother. Crazy cousin lady starts talking to them like they are best buds. Mrs Cockblockerson is standing there expecting I'm not sure what... hugs for a long lost cousin?


Introductions are done because the guys have no idea who this lady is. It turns out she's a distant cousin they haven't met since the ages of about 4-8 between them. They've never even met her through the family. She was a temporary worker in the school library. 


In the off chance that my husband and brother in law would remember her my MIL and this crazy woman tried to catch me in some non existent trap.

"Apology in advance for mobile formatting. 

Some of you may remember my post about having to fight Jacosta Toes to spend time with my kids or keep her word to them. WELL. 
Jacoata Toes was diagnosed with cancer. Her first doctor's visit, her sister, her boss, and her MIL went with her. My husband wasn't even told when it was. She also listed her sister as her emergency contact, not my husband. So she gets to make the calls if anything should happen. 

Well, on Sunday she came by to pick something up and my toddlers threw a fit wanting her to stay. She couldn't, she had something to do, per usual. She told them we'd do something the next day (Monday). She then texts me later and says she spoke too soon, she has cancer support group so there she goes bailing on my kids again. 

Wednesday, DH texts her and asks if she wants to get together. She can't, she has bible study. So at this point, we've made every attempt possible to get her to see the kids (who ask about her every day) because we know Thursday is chemo day and DH works all weekend after that (and has our only vehicle). 

DH texts her today to see if she wants to see the kids. Her last chemo treatment, she was out and about on Sunday after treatment on Thursday. She told him no, she is feeling really badly today. I get that. I know, chemo sucks and cancer sucks and she feels terrible BUT she is spending all of her good days with everyone else and making no time for my kids and husband when she feels okay. Her bible study and cancer support groups aren't going to grieve the loss of her for the rest of their lives if something happens.

I'm so irritated. I didn't expect cancer to REALLY change her but I figured after that and the sermon last Sunday about ""only God knows when we'll leave the earth, it could be today or tomorrow"" something would give.",JUSTNOMIL
"I’ve been married to DH for approximately a decade. At first I thought his family were lovely, but I had no idea what I was getting into. Gradually it became clear that DH was treated terribly by his family, and his mother was the instigator. By proxy, I then became the target of ridicule. We lived nearby to the IL’s, but a decision was made to move away to move away. Even though the decision was made by the two of us, MIL became so angry, that DH cowered.  To placate her in the moment, and not deal with the abuse she was throwing his way, he told her it was all my decision. He admits he was wrong to do that, and it caused a big rift in our marriage, but that’s a story for another sub. 

Since moving here, she doesn’t visit, and keeps in contact with my DH only, not me. She has made it very clear I am disliked, and has proceeded to turn the rest of the family against me. My BIL, SIL, FIL now treat me with distain. Plans are always made for family get togethers on the day they know I’m working, and I’ve said it doesn’t bother me,,,but it does. I’m ridiculed even when I’m not there, and my DH just allows it to happen. In fact, he doesn’t even see that there’s a problem, even though he totally admits that his mother has everyone ‘under the thumb’, even him. He will say or do anything to gain her respect and admiration, and she holds it out like a carrot on a stick. If I show any emotion, or make comment that I’m frustrated with the situation, I’m laughed at, humiliated, and made to look like a fool(by the in-laws, not DH). Her hold over the entire family is like nothing I’ve ever seen. Her reaction to any confrontation is to laugh, and ridicule.

I just got an excited call from DH telling me they finally made a family function on a date I can go, but a closer look at the calendar shows that, nope, it is on my regular work day...again. When he called her and suggested we might come another day, she belittled him and he cowered once again. Even moved to get away from the bullshit, she’s still there, picking at our marriage until it falls apart. We have three children, and I need this woman and the hold she has on her family, particularly my DH, to stop. I also need to figure out why I’m now in this place of needing her approval, and the approval of the rest of the family, when it’s clear I’ll never have it. If she didn’t have such a strong hold on DH, it would be so easy. We’d go NC, and be done.",JUSTNOMIL
" so I don't technically have a ""MIL"" as I'm not married yet, but for the past year or more of me and my SO relationship my boyfriends mother has been constantly, every chance she GETS, been whispering in his ear that I'm ""just using him"", or ""nothing is going to last"" or ""I'm horrible for him"" and is always going to him and talking down on me, and even going as far to tell him things I'm doing or saying that ARENT EVEN TRUE just to try and sway his opinion of me because for some reason she feels that threatened by me she thinks she needs to destroy our relationship. And when I say any chance she gets I mean she seriously has come up to him randomly at their house, brought it up randomly when hes visited her at work, she she even goes as far to bring it up in front of OTHER CO WORKERS.  I even worked for her for a year (WORST decision of my life) and she not only berated me there, she would belittle me, talk down to me, yell and scream at me, and THROW SHIT AT ME. It's not even just me she does this to she tries to drive away all his friends by trying to convince him they are the same way, it's like she feels threatened when he talks to anyone else but her so she attacks them. I dont work there anymore because shes such a horrible woman I cant work or stand to be around her, and after the way things went she literally banned me from coming anywhere near her lol. I used to semi want a relationship with this woman considering she was, after all the person who was my SOs mother, and when she was nice and in a good mood, I actually liked talking to her, but I feel like it was always more forced from her side and faked, but if I could never ever see her ever in my entire life or have her anywhere in my future including weddings or around my kids so she cant ALSO make them feel like absolute shit I would be so okay with it.",JUSTNOMIL
"For the past five years my husband has been in graduate school pursuing a PhD in a field of science. In early April he successfully defended his dissertation and several weekends ago he was awarded his doctorate at graduation. Words cannot describe how proud I am of him. He had to work very hard to get his degree and the past several years have been challenging for both of us. 

You would think that graduation would be a point of pride for my MIL (and FIL) but I honestly don’t know why they bothered to show up. I did not hear them congratulate him for anything: for getting his PhD or for the very good industry postdoc that he will be starting at in a few weeks. It was egregious enough that my parents privately asked me what the deal was. 

Instead, my MIL made a weekend that was supposed to celebrate my husband into a time to instead talk nonstop about my SIL’s fiancé. To be clear, I really like my SIL and I know that my MIL’s behavior is not her fault. But it is obvious that my MIL thinks that SIL’s fiancé (an MD starting residency) is “better” than her own son. I got to hear ad nauseam about how smart the fiancé is, how much money he’s going to make after residency, how his family is extremely wealthy and paid for his medical school so he has no loans...almost every conversation I was forced into with her had something to do with the fiancé. I felt like she completely forgot about the reason she was visiting in the first place. 

Normally my MIL drives me insane for other reasons, but I would have much preferred her typical antics to this. I could tell that my husband was disappointed - he does not like the spotlight but I think he was expecting some sort of recognition and he absolutely did not get that from his mom. There was actually even question of whether or not his parents were going to make it because my MIL wasn’t sure if my FIL would have enough vacation days left due to them taking a two week international cruise. Meanwhile they booked flights/hotel for my SIL’s fiancé’s med school graduation months in advance. 

I don’t know whether it’s worth bringing up to my MIL how poorly she treated her son. I kind of tried to broach the subject via text message, when she thanked me for hosting her for the weekend. In my response I said something to the effect of “thanks for coming, I know that your son isn’t one to revel in attention but you should really be proud of him.” In her response she couldn’t even acknowledge my husband on his own and said “yes I am very proud, SIL’s fiancé says a PhD is harder than medical school.”

It seems to me that no matter what she’s not going to get “it”, and bringing it up will start unnecessary drama. Thoughts?",JUSTNOMIL
"Just....a short one to get it off my chest.

&amp;#x200B;

Boyfriend and I were hanging out at his mother's house today while she wasnt home (originally we were going to go on a skating date as I recently purchased a pair of skates. However, his mother refused to stay home while she had men over working on her patio and demanded my bf and his brother stay home. Semi-reasonable, imo, tbh since she also did some groceries while out). I was persuaded with the information that JN wouldnt or barely be at the house and some very delicious pizza.

&amp;#x200B;

Boyfriend and I hang out, he gets the workers water when they ask (they were very nice guys, very polite). Idk 2...maybe 3 hours go by and JN arrives home. I help unload and put away the few groceries she bought. As I finish she turns to me and says, ""You got *fat*"". I look at her in shock, because *who on earth comments on people's weight???* For context Im about 5'9 and 110-120lbs so im technically underweight/bordering normal weight according to a BMI calculator. SO was standing right next to me and once we got over the shock he quickly defends me and politely says, ""No, she's not."" JN says I have gained weight and of *course* my SO cant tell because 'I dont see OP as often as you do' (a gentle jab at the fact that I do not go to her house very often). SO reaffirms that Im not fat and I havent gained any weight and JN, seeing shes upset her sonsband, tries to back track and say 'oh, its not a *bad thing*'. Then quickly changed the topic to her allegedly sticky floor and asked my SO to go get the mop.

&amp;#x200B;

I went with him since it meant getting away from JN and honestly I wanted to cry. I've had people say Ive gained weight before, but thats because I was still *growing* so I was taller and filled out (read: earned some boobs). Im 21 y/o, what ya see is what ya get at this point. Im an active person. My diet isnt the best, theres a few reasons for that, but it could still be better. I do fasting every now and then (no snacks, one meal sort of fasting. I do not advocate going for days without food). But.... I dont know why but I nearly broke down when I left the room that JN was in. I dont cry easily, but I seriously just wanted to break down just there and have my SO hold me. I didnt, though. I kept my cool and just cleared out of the house a few minutes later.

&amp;#x200B;

Idk what advice I need....fuck how about why the hell Im so upset over some horrible woman calling me fat even when I *know* deep down that Im not.

EDIT/UPDATE: I just want to give everyone here the biggest freakin hug. Thank you all so much for your words, advice, and one liners that had me laughing my ass off at points. I really needed.... all of that. Im going to be talking to my SO come morning about standing up for myself because, while I love him to the moon and back for doing that for me, I think its high time i quit letting this woman steam roll all over me. I just dont want to let it get to a point where someday she manages to say that perfect word that does get me to crumble in front of her. Ill update here come tomorrow evening :)

Thanks again everyone.",JUSTNOMIL
"My husband and I just got married. The event was lovely. We laughed, we had a blast, all of our favorite friends were there, and in lieu of an immediate honeymoon, we've spent the weekend with our favorite friends at the beach. 

But my MIL.

First, she refused to sit in the front row during the ceremony after we reserved it for them (as is customary I thought?). We later asked why they didn't use those chairs, she said she had no idea they were intended for his family. Except we repeatedly confirmed this with them as they flat out refused to attend the rehearsal or be involved in the planning process at all. I actually don't think they ever even talked to us about it except to complain about anything and everything. 

During our reception, she refused to speak to me. I'd walk up to her and she'd scurry away elsewhere. She complained about everything and treated my friends like they were staff placed there to cater to her. 

Our favorite part was when she couldn't find her preferred beer and stomped through the reception yelling, ""COORS?!?! WHERE. IS. THE. COOOOOOOORS?!?! It HAS to be here somewhere!"" It was directly in front of her, she just wanted someone to wait on her. 

But the absolute worst, most horrible thing she did for which I may never forgive her, was this: she stomped around the reception telling our friends that she ""really doesn't know"" about us and doesn't expect the marriage to last. My poor husband cried on our wedding night because he was so hurt.

And this all came as a giant surprise to us as well, because she always sings my praises to anyone who would listen. I have sat in the hospital with her for 12 hours while FIL had major surgery. I've gotten up in the middle of the night to meet them at the hospital (I'm a nurse) when he has had to go in due to major health problems. We have previously had a great relationship, and it really saddens me that she acted like this. And DH and I have been together for years, so it isn't as if we rushed into a marriage we weren't ready for. 

My heart hurts for my husband, who loves his mom and has always been willing to go out of his way to make her life easier, as have I. I'm very angry right now, but I still feel like this is something I won't be able to just let go.",JUSTNOMIL
"This is gonna be short because this only just started and I haven't even been up for an hour yet. 

TROC only just today even remotely addressed the fact that I'm pregnant. She sent a text (actually a series of texts) about the gas bill and the rent, and then one text asking ""So how are you feeling today?"" I responded with a brief text reply about the bills (basically ""thanks, and already paid""). So she then sends the same question and demands a picture too. 

I basically grey rocked this BS with a PA pic of my barely awake face and the edge of my coffee cup. Saying ""just waking up and having my 1st cup of half caf of the day"". Fine, she ""wants a pic"" she gets a pic of my face...nothing below my shoulders bitch. She can't even bother to say one word to me about being pregnant between May 18th and NOW and think she can rug sweep?! Nah. I ain't doing this whole hot and cold, ignore you until I want attention BULLSHIT. My Dear, sweet husband talks to me every day and is invested in how I feel. He laments the fact that he's not able to be here with me every day through our first pregnancy (because we're a team and yes damn it he gets to say ""Our Pregnancy""). He's excited and as involved as he possibly can be while working Over The Road. I schedule my OB appointments as much as I can around his home time so he can experience this with me as much as possible. My BFF is a bit more busy wrangling her own 3 lol munchkins (2 toddlers and an infant) but she talks to me whenever she has the chance and we have great conversations about pregnancy. She's excited for me that I'm pregnant for the first time and discussing all the changes and symptoms I'm going through. My LB is the one helping me watch my blood sugar and taking me to appointments (like for my Endo) and cracking jokes about ""peeing like a pregnant woman"" (referring to himself which makes it hilarious) 

But TROC...TROC has barely said 2 words to me since the 18th and none of them were about pregnancy. This is the first time she's even hinted at it and if there was no context, you wouldn't even know she was addressing my pregnancy at all. Or maybe the context is that I know her well enough that I just KNOW she's asking because I'm pregnant and only *now* does she wanna play *""happy family""*. 👿

This just pisses me off. Ugh.

If anyone wants to help me translate the narc or untangle some of this JN mind game BS...please feel free. Did I play into her demands or grey rock? Ugh I felt like that was a petty AND grey rocking response (if that makes sense?) But I'm open to suggestions for better types of responses or come backs.

ETA 

TROC just texted me back that she ""wanted a picture of [my] belly!"" And she ""knows what [my] pre-coffee face looks like""
It took a little over 2 hrs to respond to my grey rock reply of her demands this morning. I'm in no rush to respond now but how do I grey rock this?

2nd Edit


So I decided to just respond with ""Why?"" (Maybe get some clue as to what level of JN-ness I'm dealing with here) and she replied with this: ""Are you getting bigger yet?  I am excited to see my grandbaby grow"". Sigh. 
So I text back ""No. And I hate taking pics anyway."" I'll crack down on this harder if/when she brings it up again but I think this was as much as she deserved today. It's subtle but says 'don't expect a ton of pics.' She made me feel like shit as a teenager for being a little heavy through puberty...wtf makes her think I wanna share a crap ton of pics of myself at a time when I'm gonna be gaining weight like crazy?! It's taking everything I have and extra loving support from my husband to not feel like shit for the little bit of weight I've already gained! So no, TROC. You do not get to just demand fucking pics of me whenever you damn well feel like being interested. Ffs",JUSTNOMIL
"OKay so the goal is obviously to move out - and total independence. But in the meanwhile, any advice? 

Moved in with boyfriends family. he's 29 (m), I'm 29 (F). I'm battling depression/anxiety.. Normally the family is pretty good about giving us our privacy and space. But MIL is very controlling/very close to my bf. Every morning, she's up and in the kitchen, like it's a school run. There for breakfast, makes him his work lunch, does his laundry, EVERYTHING. So now I""m living there too, and it's throwing a cog into the machine  (yay). She also makes dinner for everyone. It's been making me feel phsycially sick, the last week, I've gotten my own dinner out, simply because I felt like I needed some independence. I was like, this is too much. Back off for a while. Everytime, she comes down on me hard for not eating. She tells me BF, and he comes to me. Since I haven't been eating her food, it looks like i'm being bitchy. I feel like I just need some space - which I said to my bf. She has the power to kick me out. And has told me on numerous occasions, that if I'm not getting help from her, that there's no point in me living with them anymore. (I haven't told my bf this) I don't want to join in the manipulation... She gave me a document to read, I said I'd read it with my bf. After a couple of weeks, she said don't bother waiting for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_, it'll never happen. (again, I haven't told him this) I've written everything down, and have some things recorded, just in case. I really don't know how to handle this. I feel like in my gut. I know I need to fight her off.

"Hello JustNoMIL, I am posting here asking for some thoughts and advice on my mom along with the current situation as my girlfriend recommended it to me for getting some outside perspectives. I'm a 23 year old male for context


For a bit of a backstory: My mom has always been a bit of an over-controlling helicopter parent who has struggled to let me mature. I've often found it easier to lie or otherwise omit some details when talking to her in general because of her overprotective nature. When I was younger especially she would text me and ask me to come home at a certain time, text her often, and she'd still be pretty worried for the most part. She's gotten better but that may be because I've stuck to routines instead of new things. She's also done things for me like laundry, picked out clothes to buy, always made me food, and in general babied me for far longer than I care to admit without me taking responsibility and doing that stuff myself. I regret not becoming a better adult sooner. She's very protective and often thinks the world is scary and worries that I might not be OK when I go do stuff on my own. Two big events have recently taken place that mom has not dealt with well: me planning on moving out into my own place next year 2 states away, and me getting a GF very far that has created a complicated long distance relationship plan. You should also know my mom is very proud to be known as a helicopter/overprotective mom. My girlfriend has gone essentially no-contact with her family because of abuse and a similarly over controlling mom (much more than mine has ever been)


As of late, I am planning a trip to see GF who lives in another country in Europe. I told my parents about her a bit later than I should because of a bad past experience with a similar situation, but also because I assumed they would not take it well in general. This was absolutely cowardly on my part and I do regret not being better in that regard. After I told mom in particular, one of her first reactions to me mentioning the trip (yes I brought up the trip and gf's existence at the same time) was ""why cant she come here?"" which seems not very supportive to me now but back then i didn't look too much into it. I stood my ground and said that I wanted to go on this trip to see her home and mostly brushed off how bad of a line that was. She's insisted on saying it would make more sense somehow for her to come here (her being younger and holding much less money than me). 


Now its been some months since then, my gf and mom got to video call a couple months back and that did not go well as you can imagine. She asked a lot of questions and wasn't very personable. Her first line of introduction was ""Hi i'm [MyName's] mom and as you've heard i'm quite overprotective"".  It felt to my gf and me watching that it was a cold job interview. My mom works in Human Resources so it isn't surprising since she's used to those professional settings. At the end of it, she never even told gf her name and not much else other than information was received. My gf got a pretty bad anxiety attack from feeling interrogated and panicked a lot over the event. It still bothers her a lot to this day. My gf has a mom that was very similarly controlling and overprotective, but in a more abusive way. Her family wasn't much better. She recognize some similarities in my mom that remind gf of her mom. GF is obviously quite annoyed at the prospect that this woman who seems similar to her mom might be her future MIL. This distresses me greatly since gf considers having a good relationship with my family to be important, as she has no family nowadays. Being that she may end up moving to my country to be with me, she does not want to end up with no family when she's built up a sort of family there (her roommate has offered her his family as a replacement and they are quite supportive along with friends shes made since moving out)


As the trip and my moving plan has gotten closer, mom has been acting a bit weirder about me moving and trying to get me to consider staying in this town or at least nearby and not leaving her. Often she will bring up a house for sale nearby and say ""see you could go here"" which seemed joking at first but now I don't know. Mom quite frequently will mention that the state I want to move is too far, and there are plenty of better places in this state. When I've told her the reasons I want to go, she almost seems to ""forget"" them every time like they aren't valid. 


Here is the latest dilemma I am in. Mom said i'd promised i would i text her every 24 hours while i'm gone in the other country to visit gf. I do not remember making this promise and i hate to lock myself in those types of situations so I doubt I would make such a promise. I told her that every 24 hours is too much and i would prefer once every few days on my own terms when i was wanting to text her. She got very upset at me for that and said it felt like i wasn't considering her feelings. Her exact words were ""It feels like you're telling me fuck you, I know it will make you upset"". I've told mom that it feels she is not respecting my desire to be independent or mature on my own. Plus this is my vacation, I should be able to spend it how I want. With how lackluster I have been at being an adult, now should be the time I really step up. I want to prove to myself and her that I can be on my own and function without her watching over me 24/7. She says its because she worries about me and wants me to be safe but it feels to me that she cant trust me to function on my own as a 23 year old man. I've not been able to prove this to her much, so in that way I can understand it a little but I want the opportunity to prove i'm a capable adult on my own. 


I've really tried since the last 6 months (when I told mom about my gf) to be completely transparent and open about what I've been up to. I have done a horrible job of this overall because it seems easier to work around mom and only tell her what I must so she won't get worried or react too strongly. I realize this was a poor choice and it's led to my mom becoming more emotional now that i'm actually trying to be independent. Seeing her responses has made me question keeping her involved in my life. She doesn't seem to be very supportive overall based on some of these lines. ""Why can't [GF] come here?"" or ""Why are you moving to this town/state instead of towns closer to here? You could do this"" are the type of responses she's given to me since being open. It seems as if every idea I come up with, she comes up with an alternative instead which dismisses what I want to do. 


I've talked with my sister, about our mom and how things are with her. Mom apparently confided in sister that lately it feels like i'm going to leave home and never talk with mom again. Sister completely understands how I feel here and has had to do similar things to me like hiding where she really is (our mom texts her almost every night to make sure she's in her dorm room at university 2 hours away) and not telling her the full story on some things. This is because similar to how I used to feel, our mom would overreact, or worry, or not trust that we are OK seemingly. She worries far too much in both of our eyes and it's damaging to us being independent. Not only to us, but it's damaging to her being so needlessly worried. Me and sister have planned on telling her how we've had to act (hiding things), and that it is a result of her being too overprotective. We'd like to be complete open about things but the way she's been about my move, trip to gf, checking in on my sister nonstop, has painted her in a bad way. 


Ideally, I'd like to keep my parents involved in my future and make sure that both me and gf are treated respectfully. GF has not felt mom respects her based on that video call. I realize the future with relationships in general isn't a for sure thing and family is very important as a support structure so I wonder if i'm making the right decisions here. I've asked my real life friends how they thought about the situation and while they did say my mom was known to be overprotective far too much, I was being a bad son by calling this request unreasonable. They said i'm now realizing my mom is way too much but i'm using that to shoot down a reasonable request of hers as in this case. GF has had a bad experience with my mom, along with lots from her mom, so she's quite against me texting her every day on this trip and it seems controlling to her. I don't like the prospect of hurting my mom here, but what is reasonable?


Both mom and gf have been helpful and supportive in my eyes to a great degree but maybe you'll see it differently. Any advice is appreciated, what is the best course of action here? Thank you for reading.",JUSTNOMIL
"We’re back at the cabin, just for a weekend. I’m waiting for hubs to finish helping his dad with a chore before we go home. MIL is streaming “inspirational” animal videos on Facebook on her phone at full volume. Just one after the other. Nonstop. Full on BEC right now. 😐",JUSTNOMIL
"Long time lurker, first time poster and all that jazz. Apologies for any format issues, I'm on mobile.

I never thought I'd have to post here, and truth be told I never really wanted to, but within the past month there's been a couple of issues that I could do with some advice on. This issue is currently ongoing. This will likely be quite long as it's still very raw, so apologies for that. I'll do a TLDR at the end.

Some clarifications; I'm 22, BF is 30, mum is 39, nana is 65.

So I found out I was 8 weeks pregnant in August last year, a complete surprise but BF and I were over the moon, we've been together just over a year but are living together, both in very stable jobs and extremely happy together, so we were ecstatic to be sharing that love with a mini version of us. My mum suffered two ectopic pregnancies when I was in my teens, so she was thrilled to have a grandbaby on the way. Everything was great while I was pregnant, no morning sickness or terribly bad mood swings, but this has all kicked off since my DD was born 5 weeks ago. 

Mum is very involved, which I'm very grateful for as we're extremely close, she stayed with us for 2 nights after the birth, exhaustion took over and I completely broke down over the phone to her at 1am and begged her to come over, as I had 40 minutes sleep over the three days I was in hospital, BF didn't get much more than me. It was a vacuum delivery so I was pretty fragile after the birth, but DD was and is happy and healthy. Last week, however, she kinda showed her ass when she asked me if DD could stay overnight at her house, I told her I was fine with it but I had to speak to BF to see what he wants to do, as we agreed before she was born that we would have an open line of communication on all things concerning DD to prevent any crossed wires or mixed up plans. My mum got shitty and said that I shouldn't have to ask BF because she asked me, and that should be enough, I shouldn't have to ask for BFs ""permission"" (uh what? I'm not asking him for permission, I'm asking for his input/opinion). I told her that was unfair, that he has as much say as I do, because he's her parent as much as I am. She asked me if BF would ask for my input if his mum wanted to have DD, and I said yes he would, because we agreed on it. My mum asked me what I would do if she was in one room with me, and she asked to have DD overnight, and BF was in another room with his mum and she asked to have DD overnight, and I told her that her and BFs mum would have to sort that out between them, as that wouldn't be fair for me or BF to pick between them, and the mere fact of her asking such a question was unfair. After that, she didn't say anything else on it.

I spoke to BF about this and I told him what she said, because it was pissing me off the more I thought about it, and I wanted to know his thoughts on it. He told me that we would keep going as we are, and we'd monitor that in case it became a regular thing. Now, I'm a stubborn little shit and I don't generally budge when I've agreed with BF on something, especially where DD is concerned. My spine is already pretty shiny and I'm not afraid to get into it with her if it comes to it. 

On Saturday, we had a family birthday, which me, my mum and my grandma (who I'll now refer to as nana as that's her name for me) attended. It was agreed upon beforehand that my nana was to have DD overnight on Saturday to give me a little break as BF works nights so I'm exhausted most of the time, because of him working nights, and me still being on maternity leave, I'm with DD from the buttcrack of dawn until BF comes home, so I get to spend a lot more time with her than he does, so when it comes to my mum or my nana asking to have her overnight, 90% of the time I'll say ""I'm fine with it, but I'll need to speak to BF, as he doesn't get to spend as much time with her as I do"". Here's the thing though, he has never said no to them having her overnight, as he feels it is important for them to spend time with her too. I'm an only child, so this is the first grandbaby for my mum, and great grandbaby for my nana.

We got home from the birthday and mum asks me about having DD on Sunday night (tonight), and again, I tell her I'm fine with it but I'll need to speak to her dad. She gets a little irate, but I ignore her and call BF through to the living room. He says it's alright to have her (which I don't hear as I was feeding DD, but he later filled me in on) but he suggests mum having her every second Sunday instead of every Sunday, and mum gets irritated again. He's getting ready for work, and my nana is getting DD's things organized for her overnight stay, so I'm in the living room with DD and my mum alone. I tell her that it's fine by me if she stays, but she needs to clarify with BF first. She rolls her eyes and tells me it doesn't matter. 

Now, I'm not proud to admit it, but I've got a very quick and explosive temper, and hearing her getting petulant because I want BFs input before I make any solid plans for DD is really grating on my nerves, I feel like she's treating him as secondary to me, so I snap. The conversation went as follows after she rolled her eyes; 

Me; Don't fucking get like that, I told you before that BF has as much say as I do when it comes to DD, I'm sick to the back teeth of playing middle man and then feeling bad for asking for BFs input. 

Mum; I just told you it didn't fucking matter.

Mum (as I'm getting DD into the pram); lets hope you're in a better fucking mood when I next see you.

Me; Likewise.

BF, nana and DD were all present when that happened. I didn't raise my voice, as I refuse to shout around DD, I don't want her exposed to arguments and verbal fights because I was privy to all of my mum's arguments and it has affected me in later life, BF agrees with me on this.

So today, my nana calls me around 1pm to ask me what's happening with DD tonight, I say to her that it's fine for my mum to have her (after BF clarified he had already told her it was okay). I was about to explain that I got my wires crossed the day before and didn't realise BF had given his okay for it, and my nana totally steamrolled me and started shouting at me over the phone, and actually had the audacity to ask me if BF would ask for my input if his mum wanted DD overnight. Of course he would, we agreed to get clarification from each other first before we made plans. I tell her yes and she promptly hangs up. This is, word for word, what my mum asked me last week. This is very out of character for my nana, and it has really upset me that she cannot see where me and BF are coming from. 

I go through to our bedroom where BF is still sleeping to wake him and explain what happened. I was in two minds whether or not to call my nana back and tell her to come to the house after she meets my mum from work so we can all talk about this and attempt to resolve it, or just leave it. BF tells me he'll support whatever, but he feels like shit about this. He feels like he's being treated as a problem when he's done nothing wrong, he's never refused my mum or nana time with DD, he's being persecuted for having a say and it's extremely unfair. So I call my nana back, and I ask her to bring mum over when she meets her after work with DD, she tells me that she'll mention it to her when she sees her. 

I hear nothing for 2 hours. My mum finished work at 2:30pm and I hadn't heard anything until 4:35 when I messaged her asking if she was coming over. She gave me the BS excuse of her feet hurting and DD needing fed. I couldn't care less about your feed, and DD could've been fed here. She didn't even have the decency to call or text to say she wasn't coming, she just met my nana with DD and went home. 

I don't know what to think about all of this, I'm hurting and I'm angry that she would act like this. My dad wasn't around at all so I understand that she didn't need to ask for his input but I figured because she knew how badly my dad not being there still gets to me, that she would understand that I never want DD to feel like I did, and I want BF included in everything concerning her so that she doesn't feel like he was a backseat parent. I love my mum so much but this totally blindsided me and BF, and my heart hurts for him. He has done nothing wrong, he's an amazing father to our baby, but we're both being punished for doing the one thing we agreed we would do and sticking to our guns. I don't know if my mum will talk to me about this, or just be passive aggressively quiet until the dust settles.

I'm asking for advice, because I'm at a loss. Both BF and I are angry, hurt and upset by all of this, so any advice is welcome. Please be gentle, we're both still very new parents so this has been a continual shock to the system.

Thank you for taking the time to read ❤️

TLDR; mum and nana don't think I need to ask for BFs input when it comes to making plans for 5wk old DD and has been petty and childish since I told her otherwise.

"My SO is the baby out of his siblings. He has an older sister, an older brother, then him. When I first moved in with my SO and his family (just his brother, his wife, MIL, &amp; brothers kid / sister has gone no contact)  everything was nice, I did notice quickly how his mom tended differently between my SO &amp; his brother. It first started small, with like money, and making things he wants for dinner, well here we are 5 years late &amp; she’s gotten his brother 3 fucking cars, she has put multiple credit cards in her name for him to spend money on shoes and whatever else he wants, she is constantly running errands for him, she has paid for numerous lawyers because he always has his name in some type of law drama, she has supported him while he hasn’t had a job OR his wife, she only wants to do things with him and his little family. Now, where I get fed up is obviously how different she treats my SO and his brother. It’s so blatant and in your face I can’t help but to feel a way. She refuses to ever do anything with us and our kid, everything turns into something about his brother - or we end up doing something his brother wants to do, &amp; if we do get lucky and she wants to do with us she will complain the whole time, how far it is, how expensive it is, JUST ANYTHING. she has never loaned us money, she never wants to eat dinner with us, she will legit wait until his brother is home wether it’s 5 in the evening or 5 in the morning she will wait, we drive an older car and I’ve been wanting something new but our credit isn’t great, &amp; we’ve fallen on hard times right now, so it was just a thought, my SO asked her if she would co-sign at the very least and we can do the rest we just need a co-signer and she laughed and said “are you joking? I would never” it hurt me so badly because in the next tongue she is saying how bad we should feel driving our kid around in “an unsafe car” (for the record, we got it fixed our vehicle is safe) she goes all out for his brother birthdays but gives my SO the worst last minute cheap presents she can think of, and I know this all may sound ungrateful but the manner in which this is all handled is so nasty, she has to make it known my SO is not her favorite “I only help you sometimes because of your son” she told me this one day, &amp; I can’t bring myself to tell SO because I know that would send him over the edge. Despite how this woman acts towards him, he still tries. He still tries to do nice things for her, buy her nice things, invite her with us, sometimes his brother gets in these pissy moods like a teenager (he’s 40+) &amp; he doesn’t want shit to do with her unless she cowards down and apologizes or buys him something or pay one of his bills. Mind you, my SO and I are the only ones who help with her medicine, make sure her car is up to date on maintenance, we make sure she gets to her doctors appts and that they go well, we help with the cleaning even though we ALL live here, the brother is fucking lazy so his daughter and his wife, we help her with the trash, the yard work, everything besides asking her for anything.. okay, we ask her to watch our baby so we can take a quick smoke break but outside of that we just want this woman to relax and enjoy these years.. not stress her by running her credit wild, letting our child disrespect her.. the list goes on. No matter how hard he tries she just.. doesn’t like him, &amp; he continues to try. It hurts me so bad to see him sad when she dismisses him. SO recently lost his job last month, he landed an interview tomorrow and he’s so excited!!! He told her about it and she responds “mmm. Where’s your brother? He isn’t home yet, I made dinner!” It just crushed me, and I tried to tell him how happy I was for him and my own mom was so happy for him but I knew he just wanted his mom happy for him. She just didn’t give a fuck. NOW, when his brother is in his “fuck you mom” shit moods that’s when she wants to flock to us, &amp; I can’t help but put a little guard up around my little family, unfortunately we all live together so there’s like.. no escaping this. Not until next February when our lease is up, which I cannot wait for, his family is under the impression we are getting another house together but I have made it a goal to get our shit together and get our own place. I refuse to have our child growing up in an environment where his father isn’t wanted for nothing more than a portion of rent, I refuse to keep seeing my SO hurt because his own mom is constantly throwing big “fuck you’s” in his face. How do you deal with this? How do I comfort my SO when times like these come up?",JUSTNOMIL

TDLR - red flags red flags everywhere past events that we are working one.  Cant really call it handled SO earned himself a post in JustNoSo

So during the 4 months MGG moved in after Baby Girl was born some things happened that made me think. “0h no this is a fucking problem” 

Now I am Southern so I will try to do just about everything to make my point nicely. I listen to crazy advice and discard it because you can not reason with unreasonable people.  So I refuse to waste my time. 

However being polite gets you no where in Greece just walked all over especially by MGG. If you listen politely they take that as consent.  I racked up 4 months of constant crazy from my MGG that she a) thinks is amazing advice and b)thinks i gave consents to. 
 
Insane statements like  “your nursing too much she is just drinking air now and that is why she has colic.” Firstly boobs do not produce air and my daughter had minimal gas. She was NOT a colicky baby if she made a sound she has colic.

MGG said the air statement at least once a day for 3 months. 

My boobs produce air....🤷🏻‍♀️

So I realized MGG had a problem with bringing her entire extended family over. 

So i tried the polite way of addressing it.  

Chatting with MGG one day I told her “i am more introverted I don't really like when all these people come over uninvited” MGG “I am not, and they are family so its fine” me - looking at her in shock thinking “Oh this is a problem” 

Southern tact technique failed. 

Next technique get the SO involved. 
My husband and I set a “once a week no pop in” boundary. MGG was like NOPE. She argued “we are family we have a RIGHT to be here”  me “no when we lived in the states i saw my family 1 a month IF i was lucky because of respect to hubby's comfort zone”  
MGG “that was wrong”
Me “well now my comfort zone needs to be respected” 

(News flash it wasn't until MGG got sent home months later and I threw a massive month long fit that i am starting to get comfortable I still feel i see them way to often like i said we have a SO problem) 

MGG in Greek to husband - we are greek (she is Lebanese not Greek) “it is cultural.” 

I hate this excuses I HATE IT SOO MUCH. 

IT is an invalid statement. a) I am American b) husband is american (he has dull citizenship i refuse to get greek citizenships thats a trap a huge trap so newsflash I am american my family is American hubby just happens to be greek as well)  ) c) we met and got married in america d) our main residence is in America  d) when we married it was understood by everyone that I was not moving to nor becoming Greek in anyway. I am American and I LIKE being American I Do not want go be Greek (Oh btw MGG &amp; So ruined my wedding so this was a point I hammered home 10 years ago) it is understood. So its cultural is BS to me

So whenever anyone tries to boundary stomp by saying its cultural “I say well I am American and in my culture thats rude” I respond w that to my SO. I need to just say it to their face. Fuck it at this point. 

So MGG ignored our boundary and called everyone over daily behind my back. Now at her house thats fine. In mine i don't want to see all her family. Oh And by behind my back I mean in front of me, to my face in Greek. (Now i am learning greek but greek is hard and I am dyslexic so its slow going) 

So they kept showing up I didn't know why so  2 things happened I made my SO come down and interrupt his work day to supervise them cause i cant anymore (still do this, he hates it so magically they haven't dropped in)  and I had SO call everyone and lay down the rule that Sunday was family day and they can stop by then if they want. (Which was me being nice it should really be once a month) 

Which did not go over well cause my In Laws are stubborn. “Well you cant pick one day it depends on the weather and the dog” etc etc and other dramatics. (Don't even ask about that stupid dog, nothing wrong with the dog but they rearrange plans because of that dog, the dog ranks higher then everyone)

So MGG keeps asking her sister over but i had told her sister Sunday was family day which her sister interpreted as we don't want her around so she wouldn't come over at all. 

So MGG who was still living with us. Sat hubby and I down and gave us a massive lecture about how auntie doesn't feel welcomed. (Who the fuck does she think she is? I am in my 30’s hubby is in his 40’s) this shit show cumulated with Hubby calling His Aunt and saying any day is find just call first and I was livid. And MGG knew it, she just sat their smirking knitting more clothes that my daughter will never wear. 

Now my husband says to me don't worry I will just enforce the 1x a week thing without them knowing which he IS doing because when they show up I force him to be with them and I go lay down upstairs. Which is a massive upset to his work day, so like I said it has stoped. 

Lately though it seems I have a SO problem as well as a MGG problem. (Continued over in JustNoSo)",JUSTNOMIL
"Hello, all! Well, I saw Mother and step-dad today, and upon entering their house I was frankly shocked at how awful it smelled - like rotting food. I opened their fridge and it smells terrible! I haven't said anything because Mother would take it extremely badly (last time I gently pointed out the out-of-date-by-over-a-week chicken in her fridge that she wanted me to eat she got mad and accused me of ""trying to insult her""). Anyway, I've got a horrible feeling that they are reaching the age where they need an eye kept on them. I will see how it goes!

I thought everything was OK about my ""novicing"" tomorrow night (see my previous post), but Mother is acting slightly offended now! She said that they might be able to give me a lift, to which I said, ""Thanks,"" and then added jokily, ""I think Dad's just relieved he doesn't have to go!"" Mum got stroppy and said, ""Of course he would go, in order to support you!"" Ahem what?! I mentioned this to step-dad later and he rolled his eyes and said he'd rather eat his own arm than go and see me in ""some stupid robes"" (not that I'll be wearing anything but whatever!) I'm not sure, but I think Mum is reframing the whole thing in her mind now as ""Turbo didn't want us there!"", when that really wasn't the case - it was getting Mum home after which would have been problematic given step-dad's refusal to go. Oh, and Mum's calling it my ""induction"" - she has trouble with the term ""novicing"" lol!

So they may be giving me a lift tomorrow but I need to be prepared for them to flake on me as it all seems a bit odd to me. If I don't hear anything by 6.45 pm I'm calling a taxi - I'll still get there on time. No point in stressing! I don't think there's much in the way of advice anyone can give (we all know what my parents are like by now!) but I don't mind gentle pointers!

Sorry for venting again but I often feel the need to ""let it all out"" when I've been visiting them - however well-behaved they are, it still feels like a strain lol! Oh - and this was typical! We were watching TV (a cookery programme), and they had a teenage girl on there with a fear of food poisoning so bad she wouldn't wat meat. Mum said, ""That sounds very far-fetched!"" But... I had a very similar phobia when I was younger (I'm much better now) and was very careful what I ate, so I knew how that girl felt. I found it really distressing actually but I never shared it with my Mother and she never noticed... I wonder why? Sad, really. But by the sounds of things she'd never have believed me anyway...

Edit: I've just realised - my step-dad very likely hasn't communicated to my mum the fact that he doesn't want to go to my novicing &amp; was expecting the Franciscans to take her home! She doesn't know he said that and is probably deluding herself that he really does want to go if only I'd ask! :-/ I bet she wouldn't believe me if I told her! So very frustrating! I feel like I'm caught in the middle of them, to be honest! Sick of these games &amp; it's all so pointless - they are making something which should be simple (go to my novicing yes or no?) and making it ridiculously complicated.",JUSTNOMIL
"(I went ahead and trigger warning tagged this for **accused pedophilia** but I'm not totally sure it's warranted.) I didn't want to say anything on the post but I do thank you all for the advice/opinions, even the ones that got a little grating to hear. Just knowing that I had real people listening to what I was saying was a sort of comfort I guess. Also, I'm sorry this is long and detail filled, we filmed the whole interaction and I was keeping a journal, and I rewatched/read them to form this post, so it's a bit funky. 

I'll start off with the events that transpired after the initial event. You all suggested telling my lawyer what happened, which I did. Lawyer said not to worry too much, but to take various actions just in case, some of which you guys suggested. One of those actions was taking her to the doctor to prove my story, which I had already scheduled at your suggestions. Doctor examined her, she had a nice time because she's weird and likes going to the doctor, they said that it's pretty much impossible any inappropriate touching occured. At this point it was getting pretty late, and I just really didn't want to sleep in my house, so we drove up to my mom's house for the rest of my wife's absence, and picked her up from the airport on our way home. I tried sleeping in a tshirt and pajama bottoms, ended up taking them off in my sleep because it was so fucking hot. I also put a stack of pillows between us as well as her stuffed animals (daughter thought it was the equivalent of a pillow fort) for my own piece of mind. I thought about getting a camera to film the entire night but figured that probably toed the line of child pornography so decided against it. 

Anyways, when wife got home we put my daughter down to sleep again and had a proper chat about what occurred. She revealed that she had never shared a bed with either of her parents, especially not her dad, but thought that had more to do with their personal preferences than their morals. She told me that I was fine sharing a bed in my normal attire, and she doesn't get a say in the matter anyways because it's *my* body and *my* daughter. She gave the full details of her side of the conversation with her mom, which I will share later on. 

We called up MIL and asked her if they could come over for lunch on Friday. Bio Paternal Grandparents were taking our daughter out for a few hours, and we would just review the situation and make a plan moving forward. They agreed, as long as they got to speak with my daughter alone for 5 minutes to get her story. We agreed, but were fully planning on secretly monitoring that interaction through security cameras so they couldn't groom her or give her some kind of gruesome sex talk. 

The day of, we asked them what they knew about the situation and how they perceived each event. They said that they knew I had been with her all week and thought I would want a break, so they were coming to take her for a few hours. When they arrived, they saw daughter wasn't in her bed, and absolutely flipped, thinking she had woken up and was hiding or something worse, so they started throwing open doors and such. When they couldn't find her, they stormed into my room to tell me daughter was missing. In a state of shock and panic, they were fearing the worst, so seeing the unfamiliar sight of us shocked them, thus the screaming. When I threw them out, they decided to call my wife so she could deal with the police. They told her pretty much what they saw, although a tad overblown in my mind. They said they saw I was sleeping ""nearly nude"" in my bed with my daughter, and they think I did something horrible, and when they confronted me I got defensive and threw them out. My wife called me, got my side of the story, and called them back. In the time between her calling them back they said they thought it over and maybe I wasn't actually defensive over them confronting but instead because daughter was upset, and that they think it's pretty common for men to sleep in just boxers, and that daughter might have climbed into my bed without me knowing. When they got the call from my wife they were informed of what I said, and that daughter confirmed that she was ok. Wife also said they were disgusting people and they needed to get their head out of their religious clouds and notice that tons of dads share beds with their children. They were still wary that they were right and daughter was being fooled, but ultimately they were ashamed of their actions and really wanted to call me to apologize, but feared that would make it worse. They said that now that they had seen how it affected me they were deeply sorry and feel awful. (It should be mentioned they were both sobbing periodically and saying ""sorry"" to both me and their God in their language throughout the conversation.) Their recounting aligns with what wife and I remember happening as well, so we're good on that front.

We accepted their apology, but we could not return to the way things were. They were not getting a key to our house, ever again. If they need to get into our house for whatever reason and we aren't their we will be either getting a home security system which can open the door with the app when we aren't there, or we will coordinate with my family on letting them use their keys to let them in and whatnot. Which leads me onto our next change, we will be moving. We currently live about 30 minutes from MIL, 45 from Bio Paternal Grandparents, and an hour from my mom. In the area we're looking at right now, we'll be 15 minutes from my mom, about 20-30 from Bio Paternal Grandparents, and an hour from MIL. This was on our mind quite a bit recently, because our daughter will start Kindergarten in a year or so, and we'll need people to pick her up while we're at work. (Currently I'm working partially from home, but we're planning on stopping that when she gets a bit older as it sucks.) It made sense to move closer to someone, and my mom and step-dad have pretty flexible schedules + I have other family living in that area that could pick her up when they aren't available. Also, and I'm a bit biased here, my parents are more enjoyable to be around. So it wasn't just this one event! It was more the final nail in the coffin of deciding when and where to move. They weren't happy, but it definitely didn't blindside them. And in combination with the two other changes, their visitation with my wife and daughter will be cut significantly. All visits will be pre-planned, and there will be very few until the adoption is finalized, as another outburst like that could seriously hurt that whole process. (When we pointed this out to them they about passed out, because they know all the work we've put into doing this and wether they like it or not my daughter is absolutely my daughter, and the courts saying I couldn't see her anymore/adopt her permanently would fuck her up big time.) We generally implied that all outings until the adoption is finalized will be as a family, with my wife tagging along, but it's not absolutely set in stone that that's the ""rule"", so to speak. 

Then the time came for my daughter to be dropped back off with us. We had their ""private"" conversation take place in her room, where we set up a baby monitor that livestreams video and sound to us. They were not aware of this. We gave them 10 minutes, and there were only about two times that put me on edge that they were getting a bit too explicit for a 3 year old. My daughter's story aligned pretty much exactly with our's, and was way too ""three year old"" in delivery and style to be rehearsed. We put her down for her nap again, and asked them if they were satisfied. MIL fully lunged at me in a crying bear hug, wailing how sorry she was and that she's so dumb and that I'm a good man. I tried my best to hug back and tell her it was ok and what not. Then they left, and we haven't really mentioned it after that. 

I never learned why they think a man sleeping with his daughter is gross, but I think I might've changed their minds? Maybe? Honestly most of what came from their side was crying and expressing how sorry they were, so I'm not sure what their entire thought process was. They were generally pretty compliant, with only a little bit of ""but I don't want that to happen!!!"", but we held our ground. I haven't forgiven them for what they've done, and I'm looking forward to these next few months of peace away from them. But I'm happy that the police weren't involved and that everything turned out ok. Sorry that this wasn't the Big Epic MIL Confrontation you guys are used to! I might post an update once the move is over/the adoption is finalized/etc. to look over how they've reacted/followed the rules (because I definitely foresee some line toeing, especially since this is such an immediate 180 from our previous setup.) Once again, thanks for the support, and I'm sorry if I came off like a dick in the previous thread.

Edit: On top of all that good news, I just got a call from our lawyer saying that the adoption is going to be over sooner than we thought (as in end of June maybe) and it's looking strongly in our favor! It's been a great couple of days.",JUSTNOMIL
"So i posted this in Entitled Parents but was told this seems good to be here



So... This happened just recently and both my mother and I are seething about this.


Let me give some context.


My mother is diabetic. Shes type 1 and had it majority of her life. Shes in her monopause state now and she's gotten a lot of horrible issues (Depression, Oesteoporosis... Etc)). Recently she got this illness ((I dont know what its called but before she had to go for a scope, she had to fast, that already is a pain for a diabetic.)) Anyway the granny is on my Dads side ((however i have plenty of stories about my mother's mother)) 


Anyway, lets go into details about this bitch of a nan. 


Cast : Me-Me, Ma: Mother, EG: Entitled bitch. 



It was around 4pm and my mother was in hospital, i was home and dad was elsewhere. I was starting to feel hungry so I went to make myself food. I was working on art commissions and an outfit, so i haven't ate since 12pm ((I've a strong hunger)). As a vegetarian, i began to make some tofu curry for food. 


Thats when this bitch enters. 


As im walking towards the fridge, she doesn't even knock, she just walks in with a carton of eggs and looks at me. 


EG: Oh, hello OP. What are you doing. Weres mam. 


Me: Shes at the hospital, she'll be home soon. Im just mak--


EG begins to cut me off and continue to talk about herself and why shes here. I proceeded to make food anyway. 

As im now making food for myself, frying the tofu after cutting it and stirring the curry, EG goes to tell me how the curry's too spicy ((she had a taste)), how its not thick enough, how its... Hadda yadda yadda. 

While i was cooking, EG proceeds to go dowm the hall and check ""If the beds are made"" ((Your son cam look after himself when mams not here)). Eventaully, i went down to check and she was moping about 


Me: EG, Stop, its fine. Leave their room please... 


Eg left and came back down, and decided to take over the cooking of the curry when i told her it was fine. Now I'm a large eater so when the food was ready, it filled two bowls ((and believee I ate them)) but while i was eating, EG decided, without asking, to start cleaning up the house. I told her to put the brush away and leave it. She kept saying ""I will i will"" to the point I nearly had to take the brush off her but didn't. She Eventaully let in... Or so i thought. As i went back to eating, she kept trying everything. She wemt around rearranging photos ((well, i mean as in ""correcting the crooked photos"" even though they were fine. I turned the television on to watxh Catfish to settle her but she kept looking around.


During the wait, EG kept pestering me to get a ""real job"" as commissions weren't enough. ((her words)). I just told her it was decent income for college. 


Eventually my mother returned home and unfortunately things didn't go to plan as now she needs to revisit soon. But what she did not want was EG in the house. This is where things go downhill. 


My mother js very.... Sensitive. Things stick to her ans she gets emotional, a lot. Anyway, among the sobbing, she explains what she needs to do. Here comes Dr. Fucking EG. 

EG: *proceeds to talk about things Ma should do, even though she knows well what she can amd cant do*

Ma: I know... I know... ((she was just nodding along as she won't stand up to nan)) 


Eventaully the topics were a lot, going from moving in woth my boyfriend to Ireland trump protest, to which EG expects people to respect him no matter what ((i already ate jnto her for that)) and so forth. 


So... Among the 3 hrs of EG being here, pestering us abkut gossip amd rumours of other people, she proceeds to get her coat, and FUCKING MOVE IT ELSEWHERE 


Ma: *mouthing while looking like she'd kill* what the fuck is she doing... 


EG sits down, and I shit you not, badgers my mother about her health for a solid hour untily mother actually said this. 


Ma: You should go now. Its late. 


I looked at EG and i could see she wasn't getting what she wanted so i chimed in and said yes i have to do stuff for mam. 


She left... Half an hour later... 

She came at 4pm, stayed till 8:30
This woman pestered my mother about her health, ignored me, interrupted me and mams conversations several occasions and took over the hohse duties without bejng asked. 



My mother wasn't having it when she left, we spent a solid two hours bitching about shit she did amd everytime mentioned one thing new, she'd get worse but i had to tell her.


Me and ma both told dad but all he does is defend her.



There's no huge ending because this shit will only end when she dies because there is no convincing my dad to have her shut up and leave us all alone.",JUSTNOMIL
"Note:
DH and I are dudes, we’re gay, we’re men.

when DH and i got married, he decided to change his last name to mine, his last name was an extremely common last name and he was tired of being asked if he was related to someone with the same last name as him, my last name is spanish, and isn’t a super common spanish last name either(Ex: Cruz) so he decided to take mine 

well, WaaaMILy has a problem with every little thing on this infinite universe so OF COURSE she had to make a comment about it
she wailed to DH about how this was “destroying the family name” and “throwing away so much family history”
MIL, so many fucking people in America have the same last name as DH did, it cant destroy the family name if there’s so many people with it

she asked DH why he chose “this route in life”  and why he “would betray him like this”

DH fucking snapped y’all
“mom, if you constantly have a fucking problem with my husband, then you need to shut the fuck up, i chose my husband, i married him, end of story, if you keep bitching and moaning about every little thing i’m going to block you”

WaaaMILy didn’t even respond to that",JUSTNOMIL
"I'm going to keep this pretty vague.                            
                              
The kids and I are okay. We're not near Hag, FIL, or stbx. They didn't get a hold of my kids. We're pretty shaken up. This isn't fucking fair. Hag shouldn't be able to literally push me out of my own home. I'm an emotional wreck. I don't want any advice. I don't need it right now. I also don't need several people saying I'm stupid for not leaving before this.",JUSTNOMIL
"What the frack. He has a full time job. He doesn't have 3 weeks to cater to your every need after a knee replacement just because its summer. He needs to reboot. He needs a break from his classes, not a 2nd full time job. Use some of that money you like to throw around and hire a damn home health care nurse! Or actually, since its summer and your sister is a teacher, ask her to come help you. That would be WAY more appropriate. Go to a rehabilitation! Dont expect my DH to pull down your pants for you for 3 weeks! DH is in no way qualified to take care of your obese ass. Jesus.",JUSTNOMIL
"So this was when I was in high school, like some I used the military as a place to runaway to. Trust me when I say there are so many that run into the recruiting office's for an escape you wouldn't believe it.

My recruiter knew my situation was bad, even helped me get emancipated at 16 and in on an age waiver at 17- that's right folks 17 graduated early and was in service.  

So of course it was supposed to be a big show of everyone's family at the airport to see us off to bootcamp. (I had ran away from home and had not lived at home for awhile) someone told Fff when we were leaving.

 As I'm waiting with my friends here she comes with my abuser in tow..fake tears (because it's got to be dramatic) crying trying to bum rush me for a hug.

I dodge her embrace look at them as simply told them ""I don't know you anymore, your nothing to me but a painful memory. Know that when I turn around and walk on this plain I'm never going to give you a second thought""  picked up my bag turned around and walked towards the plain.

Now she made the mistake of swinging for me and the abuser showed his ass screaming at me foaming at the mouth how I was a heartless cunt...I just held my head high..never turned once..never lost a step and kept going to my new life. (They got stopped by other families about to kick her ass)

On the plain the recruiting person said they called security and tried to have them stop me lol I was a legal adult...they signed the papers..i was free and once they realized they lost their shit. He (recruiter) now understood why I was so desperate for those papers..why I was so desperate to leave. 

She never got her tearful mommy dearest goodbye..not then, not anytime I came home from deployments. I would never be her fake front for the world. I would be the defiant one to stand tall and never become her. I would live and succeed and she could rot in hell she choose.",JUSTNOMIL
"I guess I'm just going to type all this out as best as I can so that I know I'm being heard. I'm not alone in this irl, but the way my mom treats my sister and I has pretty much always been kept between close family members. I just want to be able to say all this and know that other people understand what I'm saying. So yeah, this might be long.   


So, for reference, I'm twenty-one years old. A college student. Living with my dad and looking for my first job (I've been very focused on school + I've been working through some anxiety issues as well that have made me hesitant to get one). My mom has always been emotionally and mentally abusive and manipulative for as long as I can remember. Her abuse usually comes in waves. We'll go a stretch of time where everything is fine and I start to think that everything might be okay, but then she eventually flips out and tries to shove all of her unhappiness that she feels about herself and her own life onto me. She also mentally abused my dad until their divorce in 2012. My dad's been one of my only allies throughout this.   


You've got the more standard emotional child abuse such as threatening to throw my toys away if I didn't clean my room. Then you've got how she's made me feel about my body throughout my childhood and teenage years. Pointing out the stretch marks on my hips and telling me to suck in my gut. My doctor only seemed to encourage this focus on my weight even though all of my vitals and blood-work were healthy. He would have me weigh myself at home every week and anytime I gained even a little bit of weight my mom made me feel disgusting and guilty. To this day I still get really anxious anytime I have to step on a scale. My mom has always been very overweight and I think she tries to put as much of her self-hate onto me as she possibly can.   


My mom has always been the type to yell and scream instead of handling anything rationally. She would threaten my sister and I to do something by saying ""I'm going to count to three, and if you don't do \_\_\_ then I'm going to scream"". Then she would proceed to scream at the top of her lungs while we were doing whatever it was. Then of course there was ""If you aren't able to find \_\_\_\_\_ and I have to get up and look for it I'm going to spank you"". This is how she handles all of her ""issues"" with my sister and I. Anytime my sister or I voice our opinions or try to explain that what we said wasn't meant to sound like it had an ""attitude"" she would get in our faces and yell at us. God protect you if you say something that my mom doesn't like. She's had me so screwed up in the past that I've been shaking and terrified to even tell her that I'm upset about something. I would do everything she told me to do and agree with whatever she said just so I could avoid getting yelled at.   


I remember when I was little my dad had to go on a business trip out of state and I was left alone with my mom for a week or two. I never wanted my dad to come home more than I did during that time.   


So, I guess to summarize one of the newer things that she's done to me, before I graduated high school my grandma on her side promised that she would pay for my first two years of college. Soon after, her health declined because of ovarian cancer. She also had a seizure that resulted in her not being able to live on her own, so she moved in with my mom. When she passed in 2017 I thought that my college money would be in it's own little bank account in my name and that I would be fine. But, I found out that it wasn't and that the only way for me to get any of the money I needed to continue my education was to go through my mom. After getting my tuition payed for for the fall semester of 2017 and buying the textbooks I needed, my mom informed me that she was expecting me to watch the dog over there while her and her boyfriend (now my stepdad) went to Hawaii to get married (yeah, my sister and I didn't even get to go to the wedding). I was unable to watch the dog and made it clear before that I couldn't. She then decided to threaten me through texting that there were ""suspicious charges on her credit card"" and that she might have to call in for fraud. Implying that she was going to try and get me in trouble even though that money had been spent on my tuition and textbooks and she knew it. So, I cut her off for several months. Stopped spending the night at her house. Talked to her as little as possible. This is when I officially moved in with my dad full-time.   


The most recent thing that happened just this past Friday (May 31st), she Facetime'd me asking about my sister and why she hadn't heard from her. Apparently my mom had been expecting my sister to be back over at her house in the morning, but that didn't get discussed with my dad. My mom had been making my sister feel like she was mad at her the night before and told her something along the lines of ""Do whatever you want"", so my sister decided to stay over at my dad's with me. Note: my dad is out of town this weekend getting my stepmom ready to move in (they have a long-distance relationship). So, my sister and I were here alone. I told my mom on the call that my sister had decided to stay over here and she said ""She doesn't have that choice"", which legally she doesn't. My parents have joint custody over her. The weekends have been my mom's time. Then I told my mom that it isn't my job to take my sister back and forth, which is true. It has never been my job to transport my sister. I've been forced to do many things by my mom that are treated like they are my responsibility when they aren't. My mom only lives a few miles away from my dad's. It's not a long drive and she's never willing to pick my sister up or drop her off. It's always left to my dad (before he goes to work) or me. My mom has been unemployed for two years and has nothing else to do with herself. She has no excuse. Anyway, she tells me that she's going to hang up with THAT look on her face and I know my sister and I are in for it. She then texts me that she's ""fucking livid"" and that's she's on her way. She also says ""I'll drag her ass out of the house if I have to, so she better be scared and ready"". I call my dad and tell him what's going on and he tells me to record what happens, and that's what I do. She comes to the door, pounds on it as loud as possible (I didn't even know someone could knock that loudly). I open it calmly, she says loudly for my sister to get in the car. Then she points her finger at me and tells me to never have an attitude with her. I told her that I didn't. She then walked into my house, headed straight for me to the point where I had to back up. I seriously thought for a second that she was going to touch me that's how fast and angry she came towards me. She said something that I don't remember, to which I countered with ""It's not my job to take my sister back and forth"". She walked out onto the porch and I yelled at her that I'm a person and closed the door in her face. I then hear her screaming that I'm ""a person that only sits on her ass all day and who has never worked a day in her life"". Because, you know, apparently working is what qualifies you for basic human respect and decency.   


Later that day I got an invitation to go to the drive-in movie theater from my sister, which I very quickly declined. She told me that my mom wanted her to ask. Like wow. Now today I've gotten a text asking me if I'm alive. No apology. No recognition that what she did was highly inappropriate and abusive. Nothing. She has never once apologized to me about something serious like this. I'm just tired of it. I've had to have therapy just so I can stand up for myself. I'm sure I have such low self-esteem and social anxiety in large part because of her. I hate it.",JUSTNOMIL
"FTP and on mobile. 

For a bit of background, my parents divorced 20 years ago and have not talked since. (my father refuses to talk to my mom). My dad remarried and I have a sweet step mother, but she and my mom have never met.

I am getting married soon and I told my FMIL and my bridesmaids that I absolutely do not want a kitchen tea. FDH and I live together and have everything we need, I don't have any female family members to invite other than my mom and my stepmom. Also, my mom has told me she would prefer not to go to a kitchen tea as she doesn't want to meet my stepmom for the first time where it could be awkward. (wedding is diffirent as there will be lots of people).

My FMIL has decided she WILL be holding a kitchen tea for me, whether I want one or not. She knows my reasons for not wanting one, and is completely ignoring it. She also expects my bridesmaids to organise it, which I feel is unfair.

I feel like she is doing it to make herself look good, rather than to help. It also feels like she is doing it to deliberately exclude or upset my mom. Am I overreacting? 

Note: she has had a few other just no moments that I will eventually write about, so it feels like part of a pattern...

Edit to add: she has basically taken over the entire wedding. I wanted a small intimate wedding that doesn't cost much, thanks to her we are 3 times over budget and inviting 100 people. But it's OK, since she is paying for the extra people /sarcasm",JUSTNOMIL
"Please be gentle with me. I feel very alone.

Well it just happened.. My fdh just texted me that what his mom does to me has put too much stress on him.. And he said he can't do it anymore. Idk if this is permanent or what cause he won't text me more abd won't pick up his phome.

Is it okay to hate her for it? I don't do anything but exist and get hurt by her and now she caused me to lose the only person I've ever cared about. 

I'm currently alone locked in a bathroom at my mums with no one to talk to. Idek if I'm posting this in the righr group. I have no friends, I'm on hold with a crisis hotline just waiting. I'm having a panic attack. 

This was the thing I've been afraid of. I've been afraid of her ruining us. And i can't complete anybthoughts. Idek why I'm posting. Maybe just cause i cant get any help anywjere else. But delete this of not allowed.

Update: after an hour and a half of being on hold, I got a hold of someone. They haven't helped at all. They've actually said it's okay for me to do what's in my head and they minimized my pain because it's only been a few hours so I shouldn't be freaking out (they actually said this). Yes it happened a few hours ago but I'm in shock and panicking because i see everything I've worked hard towards for so long disappearing because she involved herself where she didn't belong. I'm a little more calm though thanks to one of the members here talking with me about cats. 

I'm gonna try and get him to talk to me tomorrow and hopefully he didn't actually send the texts and if he did i hope it was just her in his ear (she was drinking vodka before he took me to my mums). Maybe he was drunk cause I know he was planning on drinking tonight and something from work made him lash out. No matter what, I'll update here tomorrow. 

I won't be surprised if she had something to do with this. I mean obviously she did considering he said it was because of how she treats me. 

Thank you for the comments and I'm sorry I'm not responding much. I'm trying really hard to figure out what's going on.

Update2: it's now the next day. he's still not talking to me. I've been trying off and on for 5 hours to get a hold of him. Nothing. He's sending me to voicemail and ignoring all my texts and messages. I have no idea what to do",JUSTNOMIL
"Just figured I'd share today's antics for the laugh. 

Pig Farmer went to Kiddo #1's baseball game today. I did not, because there was a chance he'd literally have to be at the field from 10 to 6 and the 2 year old is NOT up for that. 

Pig Farmer calls me towards the end of the game wanting to know what our plans are for after the game/the afternoon. 

Not that weird, right?

Except... she was at the ball game and DH (her son) was also at the same damned game when she called me. 

I asked her where her son was. She tells me. Basically, he's 10 feet away from her. I tell her to ask him what our plans are since he's right fucking there with her and actually knows what our schedule looks like re: ball. 

We hang up. I'm baffled, but she's weird so whatever. We already know she doesn't really like DH despite him being her biological offspring. 

DH calls me after the game. I ask him what he told her. He's confused. She never asked him about his plans.

30 minutes pass.

She texts me again asking what our plans are. 

She waited thirty minutes and then texted me rather than just asking her own son. Clearly, I am the nicer of the two of us. I need to work on that. 

We (me &amp; DH) decide we're not doing anything much because kiddo has to be back at the ballfield early evening. Pig Farmer is pouty, but we had shit to do. I do, however, wind up agreeing to meet her at Walmart because I need to return a broken toy of kiddos that she has the reciept for. 

Kiddo and I go to Walmart. We run into a friend while I'm waiting on Pig Farmer. She turns up and she and kiddo make the return while I'm still chatting. I make casual plans with friend for after ball, which Pig Farmer walks up on. 

Y'all, Pig Farmer abruptly gets all pissed off, says a short goodbye and storms off into the store. This is pretty significantly out of character, so kid and I are both going wtf. She completely left us alone in walmart. That has never happened at any point in the 6+ years I've known her. She's usually up my ass like a butt plug. She'd been perfectly chatty while calling and texting me earlier. 

I went back through the entire interaction in my head like three times and then I realized that Pig Farmer had heard me tell friend that we'd finalize our plans for next week when we came by her house this evening. Pig Farmer had been all about what plans we had today and I guess she got pissed off because we'd declined plans with her, but I'd made plans with Friend.

Plans........ to go pick up a pair of window unit air conditioners out of friend's shed. Because our big unit has died for the fortieth time in four years and I'm not wanting to sink any more money into it. It doesn't keep the house cool even when its running anyways. Tonight was the perfect night to dig those heavy suckers out their shed since both our hubby's were off work and available to do the digging and lifting. 

But Pig Farmer didn't hear that part of the conversation. She just heard me tell friend I'd be by this evening, got snippy and stormed off. Apparently, I'm not supposed to make plans with other people when Pig Farmer is wanting our attention. 

For the record, we ate dinner with her last night and she attended kiddos game this morning. She's had what I consider a reasonable amount of our attention in the last 24 hours. Her fucking insistence in having ALL our attention ALL the time is 75% of what makes her so damned JustNo.

"Posted in r/parents but was told to post here.

My mother clearly favours my oldest child. After this was pointed out by everyone in the family she started telling me it's because she needs to protect him from me.

According to her and only her, I dont talk to my oldest son like I love him as much as my newborn. My mum will nit pick situations to make it sound like I'm favoring my newborn. For example, there is a pretty bad cough and chest infection going around which my oldest son has. I  started the conversation to talk about oldest son being sick and how I should look after him. I then expressed to my mother I hope newborn dosent get it. My mum immediately jumped on me ""what about oldest son!"", ""poor oldest son, he is sick too."" I explained that newborns can die from chest infections. 

My husband thinks she is deflecting because she feels bad about having a favorite. Idk, they way he explained it made perfect sense. 

My mum can be werid. So usually I ignore her BS but this is really starting to getting to me. How is she going to treat my kids as they get older? 

I need advice on what to do. How do I make my kids feel equal in her eyes, if I can? 

If I cant get mum to treat my boys equally in 6 months I will go N/C until she can treat them as equals. 

Thanks all.

EDIT: So many people to reply to and so little time! Thank you all for commenting. I would like to say my mum isnt a bad person. She has some issues and sometimes needs some redirecting. I am willing to do what it takes to protect my kids but I do love the women.

Again thank you all for the stories and advice. I will try to reply to all when I get a chance.",JUSTNOMIL
"So my baby sister graduated yesterday. She just called me crying because my mom went in her room throwing some of her stuff away. She dreams of the day she can leave to get away from my toxic alcoholic step dad, who my mother chose over the safety of her children. 

Background:
My mom and I don’t get along well because she’s very irrational and impulsive. She’s very defensive and acts like a victim when things don’t go her way. She has a dismissive/entitled personality. As a child, being the oldest I always stayed home and watched my younger siblings for years without complaining. I’m always there when she needs things so she clearly takes me for granted. When she’s stressed she focuses it my way and now I do not allow her the opportunity to behave such ways. I Had no childhood or long term friends from bouncing to different schools. My last year of high school she became very protective and controlling. My bf at the time witnessed her coming outside yelling, blowing up my phone, driving to my job, knocking on my car door telling me to go home, restricting my social life, blowing up my bfs phone etc. I told her I never wanted to be like her. I only came around from then on to watch over my sister and make sure she feels heard, appreciated and focuses on the right things. 

Now my moms acting the same way towards my youngest sister. On her 18th birthday, she blew up her phone and mine just because she was at my apartment wanting Stranger Things. Mom told me babysis needs to be home before 10 and that it’s “too late”! usually my sister leaves the house to spend time with friends any time of the day or night b/c my mom has her door closed in her own world. She lets her have friends over and the flexibility of doing whatever she pleases. Until my mom wants to control or complain about something. I’ve noticed when she feels like she’s loosing control, she acts so clingy and controlling. My middle sister moved all the way to Maine to get away (I live in Texas) and my bro started his own family so he’s too busy for the bs. 

Mom married an alcoholic who is emotionally and mentally abusive but my mother likes feeling like she is in control so I know he’s suffering too. She speaks to him like a child and doesn’t see how this affects how her children date men and communicate with men either. We’ve all spoken about how we feel about him and the physical fights we children have all had with him. And yet he’s still here. Funny thing, he had a shit ton of money when they met and she spent all of it. So now he financially can’t walk away an n

Now: 
My sisters coming over and I know once she moves out for good I am going NC with my ungrateful mom. My sister has been saying this as well even though I haven’t told her my plans. It’s ridiculous and sad that we can’t all have a healthy relationship because of her. She’s tried so many times to turn my babysis against me and I’ve actually overheard conversations my sister out on speakerphone. It’s sad to say because when my sister leaves, my mom will be alone. She has no friends but honestly we are all adults now and we write our own story. I can’t feel bad for the effect of people’s choices. I’m tired and still young enough to create a good life and have great experiences. Even with dating I notice aspects of her coming out in me and I do not want this neuropathyway preventing me from having loving relationships with others. 

What’s your opinion on the situation?",JUSTNOMIL
"I have heard all of you and your advice over my MIL and husband post  , I genuinely appreciate all of it and have taken it to heart.  


I needed some time to process all the new information .  I didn't think to consider was happening to be abuse and I was very fearful of labeling people with it since it's a rather heavy  crime. I needed some time to think it over and was very confused , espically when it came to my mother's role in all this .


Don't get me wrong ,  I've pretty much accepted my husband and my MIL's role in my life as abusers but I'm having a bit of a problem when it comes to my mother. Despit all that have  happened between us , we  do love eachother darely. She does  love me and have gone through a lot for me as well . So while I made my mind up on my husband and MIL I had no clue what to think about my mother . I went to talk to my 18 year old sister who was adopted since she was a toddler and lives with my aunt in a different country. I've told her bits and pieces of my childhood and she's stayed together with my mom for about a year when she was 13 so she also had exposure to the behaviour I was talking about. My mom was much more mild with her behaviour after she was born so she didn't exactly go through things as intense as I did or as much,  but it was still a pretty stressful situation to go through . I've also been venting at her alot of the times when things blow up here,  so she knew the situation I am currently going through with my mom . 


Now the thing is , she says that abuse is a serious allegation and shouldn't be tossed around easily. She doesn't think what happened to me was abuse, messed up ya , but not abuse. All the things I went through in  my childhood was harsh but it's  in the past she  says. Now my mom is still doing similar behaviour but much much much calmer , less crazy  compared  to before. Sure I can't do anything , I have to always ask permission to do basic things and I'm not really allowed to go out /is being isolated socially as well as physically but according to her this is just normal Asian things. It's not abuse. As a ward of an Asian this is just normal life, that she's not really allowed to go out as she likes either ( although she IS a teenager and unlike me she can go out to meet friends / be dropped off so she's not really cut off from socializing.  I can only do that if I'm meeting other relatives , not friends. So I wouldn't really call her and my situation the same? But that's just my opinion.  ) 

 I seriously  don't really know how to process all this information right now. I don't want to start planning ,  saying or doing anything until I get this part sorted out. It IS a serious thing to be saying about one's parent. I know the rest of my family is going to say the exact same thing or similar and go on to talk about how much my mother have suffered, sacrificed and done for me , and it is indeed true. She really has done all that . I have messed up alot in life as well , like flunking college twice ( in my defense they kept stuffing me in to schools  while I wasn't ready and had too much on my plate .  I was trying to deal with getting raped as a kid and being suicidal over it and a lot of other things , they were really eager to put me through schooling and get things done as fast as possible  ) , or  like the whole pregnancy thing and while she did react badly for the first year+ ( and caused a rather long lasting issue ) , she eventually came around and have been the one who's been financially supporting us all this while . She is the only reason we have managed to go this long if it wasn't for her lending me money every time I needed it ,  I don't  know where I would be.


 This is why me and her keep having a love hate relationship in the first place. I appreciate all the positive things she's done for me and still continue to do to this day, despite all the negative things she's done to me ..........but at the same time .......... I  also have had a hard time accepting all the negative things and letting it go/forgiving/forgetting it all. 

 I just really don't know how to feel about this. At all. I feel like I've had my ground pulled from underneath my feet , like my whole life wasn't as I actually knew/saw it.  What is even real at this point. Is my feelings even real. Hell is my view point and perception of life even right or real.  

I think I may need some professional help and get some therapy to sort out my shit. But therapy is so damn expensive and definitely not easily accessible around here , so Reddit it is. 


Ya'll gave me a stern reality check and advice when it came to my MIL and husband , can you help me sort my mind about my mom.  Give it to me straight , is my sister and family right ? If I really do chose to go the international refugee route I will have to disclose information about my childhood and all about my mother too , I have to make my mind up exactly what role she really has in my life. 


If u need a back story and a detailed post about the exact relationship and incidents I've had with my mother since childhood , I can upload it next.  I warn you it will be long. For a summary and a rough outline of things,   check out "" What is a normal mother daughter relationship "" I wrote a while ago when I was seeking clarification on things",JUSTNOMIL
"My mom is a JNMom. She has some sort of diagnosed personality disorder, but refuses to tell us what it is. I’m pretty sure she’s borderline, but that’s just my non professional opinion. Anyway, I’m pregnant with my (22f) and my fiancé’s (21m) second baby. This pregnancy wasn’t planned and didn’t happen at the best moment, but I have health issues that can lead to infertility so we accepted this baby for the blessing that he is and decided to keep him. Just some backstory; my fiancé, our three year old and myself live with my parents. It’s not ideal, but we cannot afford to live on our own without both of us working. I’m currently a full time student studying social sciences with the end goal of being a lawyer, my fiancé works full time an a mechanic. We have enough to pay our bills, but we stay on a tight budget. 

From the time my mom found out I was pregnant at 14 weeks until now (I am currently 25 weeks), she has not been happy. I understand not being happy about the situation, but the way she has treated me has been outright rude and unloving. My fiancé and I decided we want a homebirth. A huge part of my health issues is insane allergies to medication, almost every single medication I take I have an adverse reaction to and because of this we decided it would be safest for me and for baby if we had a homebirth with a certified nurse midwife. Besides my health issues, a big reason we want a homebirth is we live literally four minutes away from the hospital that has all of my medical records and my hospitalizations, I feel safe there, but they’re not accepting of the type of birth we want. My fiancé and I are modern day hippies and truly believe pregnancy should be treated as a normal process of life. My preferred hospital does not hold the same philosophy and their c-section rate is nearly 50%. As a science and statistics person, this rate does not make me comfortable. The hospital also doesn’t allow midwives or doulas, so we’d be on our own fighting for an unmedicated birth. My fiancé requested a doula and both of us are very uncomfortable with the idea of laboring without one. 

Since I told my mom about our birth plan she has been incredibly unsupportive. She texts me and tells me constantly how this choice is going to kill my baby. She’s even been threatening to take my three year old and “run away” with him when I go into labor. When I told her my FMIL was supportive of our birth plan and she’s taking him while I’m in labor, she became livid. During this conversation, I also told her that I’m not planning on telling her when I’m in labor unless I have to and she is not invited to be a part of the birth, which pissed her off as she expected to be there. I truly don’t understand how she could constantly tell me my child is going to die because I’m planning a homebirth with a birth professional, four minutes away from the best hospital in our county and still expect to be a part of this baby’s birth, but my mom is irrational so of course she’d assume she was welcome. 

Yesterday she was complaining about how no one on her side of the family called to wish my little sister a happy birthday, my birthday is two weeks before hers and I mentioned that no one called me either. Her response; “they’re all pissed off at you for getting pregnant again and planning a homebirth. You don’t understand how dangerous of a choice you are making!” I said to her that it’s fine if they’re pissed at me, that’s their right, but it’s my right to keep my newborn away from the people who were unwelcoming of him and they’re not going to be allowed to meet baby after he’s born. Obviously she was pissed about this, but I truly don’t think I should have to have toxic people around my newborn and in my postpartum space. If we didn’t live with her, my mom wouldn’t be meeting this baby either.",JUSTNOMIL
"Team. It happened. I spoke up and was calm as shit and hit JNMIL with a one liner. 

The background. I’m a very private family person. Check out my last post if you’d like. I like boundaries and being in my safe space. JNMIL is a sweet lady but she love bombs me (and wants my DH to be her husband), So I usually just take it and move on or change subjects. I hate confrontation. I’m the master of deflection and it’s a true art - a skill I learned growing up. She would love it if I saw her all day every, text constantly with a thousand emojis, and be best friends. I’m not there and probably won’t ever be. People sometimes don’t click and that’s not a bad thing, it’s just incompatibility between personalities. I’m nice and polite, but I’m not fake and I’m a TERRIBLE liar as in my facial expressions are my worst enemy and give me away. So no poker for me ever. 

Story time. We had a family get together and DH and I go to MILs house first. Here’s the conversation;

Me: hi MIL! You look lovely!
MIL: hi DIL! I never see you, you HAAVVVEE to come to my place!!!!! You haven’t been here in so long and you never come over!
Me: WOW - that’s the first thing you say to me??
MIL: well DH comes over and you should come with! (She was caught off guard with my earlier comment)
Me: well I work on days he has off.. 
MIL: he does so many things and chores around my home
Me: nope. I don’t want to come here and do chores. Hell no. 
MIL: we can sit and drink wine and relax

Then I was interrupted by BIL showing up. It’s like it’s never enough and she always wants more and more. I get that she’s being welcoming, but she doesn’t pick up on my reactions and just continues and talks over. I’m just being blunt now. Does anyone have an MIL that means good but just keeps going and going, and if people tell her to stop, she stops for a second and then resumes or says “but that’s just my opinion”? She plays the fragile card and I just can’t with that mess. She just doesn’t listen and take pushback seriously. 

I’ll admit I felt guilty but a proud guilty. Baby steps team.",JUSTNOMIL
"So i took a little break from this sub cuz it was getting really weird here for awhile. It feels like it's getting more back to normal. I've also been afraid to post the good updates, in case i jinx it all.  
Ok i'll start with the old story, that will also explain why i am nervous about her next visit. So about 2 and a half years ago, FF came to visit and brought DH's nieces. They were like 14 and 16ish? When FF gets a hotel it always has to have a pool and she always wants the kids to swim. She's not (and has never) been allowed to have them in the pool by herself. The nieces are big girls, both in ROTC, and swim well. We thought it'd be great if they took our kids and their friend swimming while we did literally alllll of the xmas shopping (like the last weekend before xmas). FF said they'd get dinner at the restaurant in the hotel. So we leave kids with them at 4. Run around like crazy and get all the shopping done and come back to the hotel at 11 to get the kids. Our kids (6 and 9) and friend (9) are fucking ready to gtfo. They all look worn, super cranky, half sobbing, fighting, their little friend had circles under her eyes. Like, wtf happened?! They all start screaming that they're starving and wanna go home like RIGHT NOW. FF chides them that they all had had cheese and crackers and salami and some clementines. That she just fed them before we walked through the door. What happened to dinner FF? Oh well i wasn't hungry, they didn't seem hungry. Yeah ok we gotta go now bye. Ah but first nieces need to give kids xmas presents, some t-shirts their church handed out with bible verses on them. k thanks. 
We get the whiny, cranky kids in the car and find the nearest drive through and let them eat in the car. By the time we got home they were feeling better and we put a movie on and listened to them rant. The last time these kids had eaten was lunch, at 11am. So they went almost 12 hours with no food after playing in a pool for 6 hours. Don't forget FF is a nurse, so she should have known what a horrible idea that was. Their friend is the skinniest beanpole ever, just natural genetics, and she snacks like all day long. I can't imagine how hungry that poor girl was by 11pm. We ask if other than being starved if they had fun. The pool was fun, the impromptu bible camp not so much. Friend asked if nieces knew how to talk about anything other than jesus. Friend is raised to be tolerant of all religions just like my kids. Her and her mom pray every night (to whomever is listening). But she was a bit freaked out by every conversation turning into jesus, god, sin, etc. My kids have just learned to block it out.  
And the next day we got to see what she meant. It's like these kids couldn't just have a normal conversation without it veering off into ""last week at church we blah blah blah, and next week we're going to see (christian artist) concert, etc."" Odd thing is, their mom (FF's only daughter) is really tolerant, supports gay rights, birth control, people's right to have a different religion, basic human rights stuff. Their dad is... kinda a weirdo (see past posts) and not religious at all. How did these kids get so brainwashed? Now i'm not saying being religious makes you brainwashed, i'm saying not being able to have a single conversation about anything in the world without bringing your religion into it makes you sound brainwashed. Well, FF has been allowed to take these girls to church since they were babies. Every sunday, wednesday, any day there was something going on, every bible school, every youth event, all the time. FF has to constantly have a preacher's podcast playing in the background, or christian music. All books are christian, all movies too. The amount of veggie tales we've trashed between both our families is astounding. Oh, she also gave the kids A Pilgrim's Progress a few christmases ago (sorry, my 6 year old didn't register for her theology class in time). Anyway, lots of indoctrination attempts with my kids. Seeing my nieces like that made me upset. I want my kids to be able to choose, through their own experiences, what and if they want to believe.  
I had pretty much forgotten all about that incident till FF said she wanted to bring nieces with her next month. And get a hotel, with a pool. So i brought up that incident to DH, and he agreed, the kids absolutely cannot spend the night in the hotel with them (FF always wants them too, and previously we thought they'd be fine if nieces were there). DS won't spend the night out of the house anyway. I went over how the indoctrination and pushing religion is not okay and would be shut down. I feel like i need to discuss this with DH a few more times before they visit, and that he needs to be the first one to shut it down, then i can back him up. No FF, we don't want to listen to (very not funny christian comedian), we'll just listen to our own music. I need him to do that! And not leave me to be the big meanie to say kids can't stay in the hotel. That i think he'll be more on board with because of FF's past of trying to control our kids' food. To him, that's a concrete problem, whereas he doesn't see the harm in giving her an inch to play her preachers in the background. Hopefully seeing his nieces' complete inability to have a normal conversation unrelated to jesus will be a good deterrent.  
Now for good (at least i think so) updates. As of xmas-ish, FF has been pretty decent. Her last visit was good, no backhanded talk, no trying to get DH alone, no messing with my stuff. Only BEC is moving around stuff in my fridge (yo the condiments go in the door you weirdo!) and adding a christian station to my music streaming service (DH totally helped her do that, password is changed). Honestly one of the best visits we've ever had. I even asked if she wanted to stay an extra night (big for me!) as the kids didn't have school. She had to work so she couldn't. I got the first actual thought out xmas present from her (a body scrub i really do like). See past posts for how horrible my previous xmas presents have been. She called several times in advance of her visit to ASK if she could come, then double check it was ok. Ok who are you and what did you do with FF? Hasn't said a mean word about me in her conversations to DH (it's on speaker, so i know DH isn't lying). Even started calling me when DH was super sick and thanking me for taking care of him. She sent me a birthday card! I have never gotten a card or so much as a happy birthday from her. This year i got a card addressed to daughter-in-law (whoah) and a check. I got just as much $ as DH did for his bday. I guess it only took 15 years for her to realize i'm not going anywhere? Either that or hell is a truly frosty, snowy wonderland right now. Is this a trick? A 6 month long con? Is it all going to go horribly wrong when she visits next month? She's even made sure to tell us she wants to visit in june (ah, ok that's this month) and she'll let us know when she gets her schedule to find a good weekend. I don't think not knowing the schedule is manipulation (like previous times), she is now sole caretaker for one man with a lifelong debilitating illness and only gets a break when his siblings or aunts can fly in for a few days. So, wish me luck. I know not to get my hopes up, but damnit it would be nice. Like isn't having a pleasant visit and not being manipulative and underhanded and actually being asked to stay another day better?",JUSTNOMIL
"TW- abuse, self harm, sexual assault

To set the stage: I lived with my biological mother until the age of 12, at which point my dad and his wife were given custody of me. My bio mom was abusive, neglectful, and had terrible drug issues along with bipolar disorder. I've mostly gotten over my early childhood at this point in my life, so we won't get into that whole ballgame. This is about my stepmom. 

I knew my dad and his wife from rare visits as a kid, but not very well. When I went to live with them, I was very eager to please them and be accepted into their family. I was also very anxious and struggling with undiagnosed depression and PTSD. So, in short, I was a bit of a wreck. All of my half-siblings were 8+ years younger than I was, so I felt like a burden on a young family. The point is, it was easy for me to overlook and brush aside and take blame for everything my new mom said and did, which I will present to you in a list as best as I can, starting out gently:

- at 13, I came home crying because a bunch of boys had called me ugly. SM's response was to ask ""what's wrong with you?"" and tell me it was ridiculous to be upset. I had never really come to her for comfort before that. 

- once she read my journal (she told me that it had ""fallen open"" when she was in my room), and grounded me for calling her a witch in it. I was venting. In writing. 

- I once told her that something she said made me angry, and SM responded with, ""I'm not holding a gun to your head and telling you to be mad, I can't make you feel anything""

- she found out I was cutting and was disgusted with my ""cry for attention"". I did my best to hide it

- at 14 she told me I'd been living with them for 2 years and so I should be ""over it"" (my childhood trauma)

- SM admitted once that she would say things to hurt and upset me to get a ""genuine"" reaction

- both dad and SM were paranoid about giving me medicine when I was sick (maybe because of my exposure to drug addiction?), so my grandma would send me home with cough medicine every now and then. Once SM found some DayQuil while going through my things and accused me of ""drinking it when I was bored"". I didn't argue because I knew she wouldn't believe me if I defended myself. 

- I occasionally went out with my small group of friends. When I would get home, I was treated with suspicion/or punished. Because of this I rarely went out. Then, I was punished for never going out. I have to stress, I never so much as sipped a beer or stayed out past 10. 

- before moving out at 17 to attend college, I asked SM if she believed that I could do it, looking for encouragement. She said I'd never given her a reason to believe in me. I had mediocre grades but graduated just fine. 

- after I moved away, neither parent spoke to me for months. The first time SM called, she passed the phone to a friend I didn't know to talk to me. She then offered to pay for me to go to a seminar to ""deal with my issues"". I was working two jobs to pay for college without any help. 

- I was raped during college and my grades suffered dramatically. I lost my scholarship but decided to double down and finish my second semester anyway. I called my dad to tell him I'd lost the scholarship so he wouldn't hear it from the grandparent I lived near first. SM was upset I didn't call her instead. After the cut contact and the ""you've never given me a reason to believe in you"", I couldn't bear to tell her and let her down. Neither of them know to this day about the assault. 

After all of this, there was one more thing. Perhaps the one thing I couldn't blame myself for. 

I moved across the country for a couple of years. I grew a lot and made tons of friends and met the love of my life. My parents tried to keep in contact more now that they couldn't see me. I finally felt free, and managed to really feel a tenderness for myself in the process. I called my biological mom and told her I forgave her, and that old weight was gone at last. I realized that I wasn't ever broken, just a work in progress. It was a HUGE triumph for me. 

Before I got married, I moved back in with my parents for a few months to save some money for the wedding. After all that room to grow, it felt stifling. Doing the planning was also an added stress, so emotions were high. I got into many arguments with SM, but the last one, a few days before my wedding, was the worst. I don't remember what sparked it, but I admitted to her that it was hard for me to open up to her, because she hurt my feelings often without meaning to. 

She responded with, ""I don't see how. I've always given you special treatment, because I've always seen you as the broken kid.""

I can't really describe to you guys how crushed I was, that after all the progress I'd made and the happiness I'd found, that I could still be ""the broken kid"" to someone I'd always tried so hard to make proud. I had finally gotten to the point where I knew who I was-- kind and soft and trying my hardest. It broke my heart that she couldn't see it. 

The wedding came and went. DH and I moved into a little apartment and I felt so relieved. I finally opened up about my depression to my very justyes MiL, who offered to make a doctor's appointment for me. Y'all, I cried. Nobody had ever done that for me. And finally got medicated. I was on the moon! But my parents very rarely called, and the distance widened. 

I've been married for nearly 3 years now, and telling these stories to my husband is how I figured out that something was wrong. He would listen to me and say, ""well that's crazy"" or ""wow, that's horrible and not okay"". Now, I feel sort of sad and sort of angry about it all. We're trying to have a baby now, and I'm worried that they'll suddenly start wanting to be involved once we're expecting. I've told them several times that their lack of contact hurts me, and it's never made much of a difference. I feel a great deal of gratitude to them for taking me in, feeding me, clothing me... I know they do love me, even if it's always been tough love. There are good memories too. But I don't know how to feel about them anymore. Every time I reach out to SM, I can hear her telling me I've always been the broken kid. 

Maybe I'm too old to be a little girl who just wants her mother...?",JUSTNOMIL

***Trigger Warning: Child Abuse***

So my mom has had control issues that's started about 1998...just two years after the divorce with Dad was done. It seems we slowly switched positions...her into his...me into her...etc. 

Her idea of ""respect"" came around when she met the man who was a salesman at a car lot where we bought my truck. (More on him later.)

She moved him in within three months...and married in secret two months after. My brother and I found out by a message on the answering machine. It was...not cool. 

Anyhow...her idea of respect...or more importantly disrespect is simple: if someone disagrees with her...then we are being disrespectful. 

She would ""enforce respect"" up to smacking and punching us in the mouth. She beat my brother pretty hard over him doubting the existence of God after our father died. 

Years later, I'm married...have a 5 year old and my wife's father was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. It was getting worse, so we decided to move three hours south to help her mother take care of him. He ultimately ended up becoming my best friend and a father figure. 

Telling Mom though....ugh...we waited until a few days before because we didn't want to live with the constant hassling and drama. 

Which proved to be the right decision. She said we could move in with them. We weren't having issues paying bills. This was all for him. She would help us find something more affordable. See above. Then...finally the truth came out:

How could we take their granddaughter away from them like this?!?

How dare we!

And of course cussing at me and saying I was going to show her respect. 

Then come the petty bitchings:

""I want that drill I let you borrow.""

We go back into my work room and she snatches it up and I'm on the other side of the room looking for the chuck to take my 15.00 bit out and I tell her I need the bit...


And she throws the drill at me...bit first. 


I dropped to the ground fast and told her under no uncertain terms to get the hell out and don't even talk to us until she calmed down. 

Later on she said I made her do it because I didn't respect her. Which didn't make sense then and even less now. 

She also waited until we paid our phone bills that was attached to her account and then had them frozen because I wouldn't talk to get until she stopped trying to do any and everything. Just wanted me to listen to what a piece of shit I was. 

When I called ""ha! I knew that would get your fucking attention...I'm not going to unfreeze them until you come back...""

I got pissed...hung up the house phone...and then we talked to her parents about getting phones on their line. Which they were happy to do. 



I'm sorry everyone goes through shit like this but it's good to know that I'm not alone and I can find solace in you guys sharing your stories and a kinship of trial by fire. 

Much love",JUSTNOMIL
"Flair is not quite accurate, I don’t mind advice if there’s some out there but I’m not really seeking any. 


It’s our next door neighbour. Yep. Right next door. I dunno maybe I’m wrong but...


* She has text me four times since the wedding asking how I’m doing, we aren’t that close, like she’s nice and all but it’s a bit odd. 


* She keeps saying she hasn’t seen me out, I’m a generation below her (she’s MILs age) so it’s not like we run in the same circles, and I missed a few local events due to trying for a baby (so not staying out all night drinking) and a concert that was booked well in advance. 


* Today she text and asked how the new mumma was feeling.


Maybe I’m just paranoid.


Also G(good)SiL was just here. They are thinking about moving which is a great financial decision for them. She’d heard a rumour that MiL talking shit and blaming her for dragging her precious son away, asked me if I’d heard anything. I said yep she’s told DH the same thing, now GBiL just rang DH to ask if that was true so DH is a wee bit pissed at me for not keeping the peace with white lies but I’m not gonna lie to her so 🤷‍♀️.


No boundary stomping attempts so far with regards to the baby news so that’s something I guess. We went publicly pregnant 2 weeks ago.


....



Edit: Oh wait, I think I know why she’s (the next door neighbour) texted today. It’s because I wasn’t at an engagement party last night of I girl who used to be in my netball team pre injuries, like 2 years ago. They work together.

I suppose I was invited, there is an old Facebook group she had set up for a previous birthday party which she posted the engagement invite on. 

But since I hadn’t seen her since the summer, she wasn’t at my wedding and it was an outdoor party and it’s freezing cold at the mo.... yeh no, an easy pass from a 14 week pregnant, possibly invited me.

Guess who would have been at that party tho... NCB and ESiL, so she’s their flying monkey, not MiLs or maybe both...? 

Either way I’m set to avoid her much more now. You’ll never see me out now flying monkey.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi all. 

I am a long time lurker, and massive supporter of this community. Some of the posts on here and the comments have really helped me to understand and deal with my mother’s behaviour, and have certainly helped me to understand how that behaviour has affected me over the years. 

So with that, I am tentatively sharing a bit of my story with her, in the hopes that I can help my husband better with dealing with her because she might be bad with me, but she is awful to him, and I want to have a really shiny spine for him. 

A bit of background: my mum is a narcissist and the kind of person who wears metaphorical blinkers. She, for her whole life, has lived and thrived from making impulsive decisions in order to pursue her ‘happiness’ but often at the expense of others, including her parents and her children. She lives in a tunnel and at the end of that tunnel, all she sees is her happiness, nothing and no one else matters. Example: She will cheated and lied to my stepdad for years because she wanted the stability of their marriage but wasn’t attracted to him. When he found out he told her she’d have to leave, and she refused to let him have any access to me unless he stayed with her. She left my younger sister (his biological daughter) with him and said ‘you can have her’ but refused to let him see me, even though (at the time) they had both allowed me to believe he was my biological father. 

I’m starting to think I have a lot more unresolved issues than I initially thought. 

Anyway, I’m going to fast forward to a situation that happened around Christmas, because it’s the one I’m struggling most with at the moment. My husband and I got married in October. He’s not the knight in shining armour type that perhaps he could be; he is working on it. My mum was all for this marriage, very happy about us, thought my husband was lovely, if a little despondent. Gets to November and I’m planning a birthday party for my oldest son (his 4th birthday) I make a Facebook group chat with my whole extended family, my husband’s family and my son’s dads family to arrange this party. I make a poll with possible dates and times and everyone votes. My mum changes her vote, she wants the party to be later (7pm) so she can take my son out to see Santa and go on a train ride (his birthday is late December so I try my hardest to separate Christmas and his birthday - but others don’t really get it). She starts on the defensive from the off: ‘I haven’t seen him in soooooo long’ ‘he’s my daughters first baby so I should get to see him the most on his birthday’ ‘my daughter will need time to set up the party’ etc. Bear in mind no one has contested her vote change at this point. 

I said in the group chat: mum, we need to have the party much earlier than this because there are children going. Also, DH has his staff night out that night at 8pm and he really wants to go so it’s going to be much easier to keep the party at 4pm. Why don’t you take DS to see Santa on Sunday (the day after his birthday). 

Cue outrage: 
Mum: I don’t CARE if he has his works do, he should be at your sons party. I go home (back to Scotland where she lives; I live in England) on Sunday so I can’t do it then. When am I going to get to see DS to take him to Santa? DH is so selfish. He can miss his works do. He is a loser anyway, I don’t know why you married him (this is the group chat with all his family in!) I have always hated him. He’s clearly manipulating you. He’s abusive. You shouldn’t even let him near the kids. IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO THOSE CHILDREN I WILL BLAME YOU FOR MARRYING HIM! 

I kicked her out of the chat. So she continued in our family group chat between me, her and my 2 sisters. 

I messaged her privately saying: mum, I appreciate that this is coming from a place of love and you just want to spend time with DS, but the way you have reacted to a small time change is completely inappropriate and it was wrong of you to send that message about DH in the group chat. If you have concerns, you should have messaged me privately. 

She then continues to message in our smaller group chat for hours about how DH is abusive (he isn’t, just lazy and a bit despondent) and how she fears for my children’s lives and how she’s going to report me to child protection (oh, also, my youngest sister lives with me because my mum couldn’t look after her when she moved them all up to Scotland so she could get married! That’s a whole new story!) and i should be ashamed of myself and move in with her with the kids and divorce DH immediately. 

I ignored her. But it has caused a bit of a riff with my husband. I was in an abusive relationship for 6 years before I met my husband. And even though I know that my husband would never hurt me or my children, the idea she has planted about him being manipulative just lingers in the back of my head. I don’t think I need any advice, I get that this is her trying to manipulate me, but I can’t help but feel like it’s working, because I do find myself internally questioning him. I need to be supportive of him, but I don’t feel strong enough to completely discredit the things she says.

"Hi new user here, I am not very familiar with the abbreviations for reddit so my apologies if I get some wrong. i am so sorry for the huge wall of text, and I didn’t mean to put “yes” in the title haha

Me (F18) and my DF(M19) have been dating for 9 months, And have recently gotten engaged. We have known each other for two years and have been on and off but this September we finally made it official. We love each other so much, and I would do anything for him. He lives with his widowed mother(my FMIL, 56) (his father died when he was about ten) and she lives right next to her own mother, his grandmother. I live with my mother as well. At the start of our relationship it was him always coming over, for about three months but then that stopped because my apartment is small and crowded, and just overwhelming over all. So we decided to start going to his house, there was more space there and it was quieter. I had no idea what I was getting into. 

it was okay at first, FMIL never spoke to me. I thought she was just shy but I found out later she has jealousy problems. She would often walk into his room and tell him to come out to talk to her, she would yell his name outside the door asking him to do stuff for her. It was just weird at first. I couldn’t really figure out how I felt about it. They have a cottage out by the beach, FMIL’s sister, brother, their kids, mother and father all go to the cottage, but if DF doesn’t want to go and says he’s staying with me, she cries and yells and says he has to. And when he keeps saying he won’t go she stays at the house with us and tries to get DF to be with her. 

She has called me a prostitute before, she walked in his bedroom and me and DF were under the blankets cuddling, she said “holy fuck DF this isn’t a whorehouse. You can’t bring your prostitute here.” And then she left. I was stunned like I physically could not speak, and DF started crying, telling me he couldn’t believe she said that, and he loves me and he’s gonna go fix it. I didn’t say anything and he went to talk to her. Fifteen minutes later he comes back in the room with her. DF tells me “FMIL is sorry, she didn’t mean to be rude”. she was fucking smiling and laughing when he was apologizing for her. I cannot BELIEVE she got him to do it for her. I was dumbfounded. And everything went downhill from there. 

This sounds far fetched, but I also believe she is attracted to him. She walks around in short shorts and see through tops, and she often presses up against him and the way she says his name sounds so sexual. when she comes home from work if she sees my shoes she usually just yells “Hi DF” So one day I brought my shoes in his room to do a little experiment, when she got home she came in his room (DF was on his computer and I was laying in bed) and started hugging and kissing his cheeks saying how much she missed him. He looked at me and I gave him an “I told you so” face and then she turned and saw me and I’m telling you, she BOLTED out of the room as fast as she could. Honestly I hope I’m just paranoid. I know he has no attraction to her whatsoever so I don’t need any advice or critique on that, he finds her gross and tbh, DF doesn’t even really like his mom, and especially doesn’t like her kissing him. 

FMIL also has cursed at me and told me to leave because of me and DF kissing in front of her. Like no tongue or anything, just little pecks. And she claims I am not good enough for him. 

His grandmother is awful, she is a bitter 75 year old woman who lives next door with a key to DF’s house. Basically, she hates me and I have no clue why. She is the reason we put a lock on DF’s bedroom door because she walks in more than FMIL does. She literally screams. She put curfew on us, for NINE.  She yells and bangs on the door and tells me to get the hell out of the house, and often DF yells back telling her to mind her own business and go home. It’s awful. I have horrible anxiety problems and BPD, every time she screams and bangs on the door it triggers a panic attack. One day i went over to his house on a Monday morning, (he gave me a key to his house so I can come early in the mornings) and she came to the door and told me I didn’t belong there and I needed to leave. I have such a huge fear of confrontation I said okay and went home. When DF found out he was furious and they yelled at each other for about two hours then he came to my house to get me. There was another time me and DF were sitting in his room when she walked in and said “oh lord, you’re here. (Speaking to me) you know no one wants you here. You’ve messed up DF’s life so much he’s a complete failure now. You’re the most pathetic person I’ve ever met” DF and his grandmother started yelling at one another and then he made her leave his house. I was shaken up horribly. DF believes she is mean to me because I’m mixed, and his past gfs were white. 

Also another horrible story, before we got the lock on the bedroom door me and DF were having sex, his grandmother walked in and stared screaming at me saying I was a whore and probably had diseases. (I lost my virginity to DF so that’s not possible.) she told me to leave and said I was going to ruin his life with a child. I cried so hard and left with DF, he took care of me at my house, we talked to my mom and she said she would speak to his grandmother and tell her to leave us alone. My mother did, but his grandmother just kept saying I wasn’t welcome at their house (it’s not even her house!!) and she should keep me at home. Then his grandmother told DF’s whole family how she caught us having sex, and I’m so humiliated, I never leave his bedroom when his family comes over now.  

Basically I have no clue what to do. I love DF so much but his family is extremely toxic towards me. Me and DF have come so close to breaking up because of them. I apologize if I am missing some information, I’m sure I am. I will edit in anything else I think is important.  I’m wondering if I’m overreacting or if this is normal behaviour for MIL’s and grandmother in laws?",JUSTNOMIL
"TL;DR on my last post: Told MIL she could not post pics of my son on FB without permission from DH and me. MIL has an epic meltdown and starts giving me the silent treatment.

As I expected, MIL suddenly resumed contact like nothing had happened as Mother's Day got closer. She just started texting the group chat with inane small talk and completely ignored the gap in communication. DH let her know I was still upset by her tantrum and she was irritated that I was ""bothered by something so silly."" Yes, when someone calls me a bad mom it takes me a minute to recover especially when that person does not apologize or even take responsibility for what they said. 

I let DH know that I would be blocking MIL's texts as I was not ready for her rugsweeping ""we're all a happy family"" messages. He said he understood. Then MIL started to escalate. Calling and texting him multiple times per day to demand why I wasn't responding to her and asking for information about our son. DH kept repeating the same line (Wife is upset from the things you said about her and needs some time and space.) This was obviously unacceptable. 

Two days before Mother's Day, she called him ready to fight. Right off the bat, she starts in about what a bad person I am for not responding to her texts and how I'm keeping HER grandson from her. That she never thought she'd have a DIL who was such a f***ing bitch. That everyone feels sorry for her because of how evil I am. That my parents are classless garbage who taught me to be disrespectful. That she's done everything for us and we're ungrateful brats. That we wouldn't be where we are without the generosity of her and FIL. That she will make sure everyone in the family knows what terrible people we are. And most of all what a disappointing son DH is. 

I could go through each of her claims to dispute them but as we know here, JustNos who feel threatened go straight for the jugular and say whatever they need to in order to cut as deeply as possible. DH was devastated. We talked for a long time about what he wanted to do. That continuing the relationship would send a message about this behavior being acceptable. I let him know I was planning to stay NC and would not be comfortable bringing our infant son around her. Again, he understood but decided he would reach out on Mother's Day out of ""respect"". 

Once again, she acted like nothing had ever happened. She was pleasant and cheerful. Asking what size our son wears so she can buy him clothes. DH feels torn. All the hot and cold is making him doubt himself. He is starting therapy but he also expresses resentment towards me for making this so complicated. I point out that all I needed was an apology from his mom but she has continued to double down on me being the problem. 

Now she is calling him constantly asking to visit our son. She hasn't seen him since he was born but said that since we won't send her pictures she's coming to take them herself since that's her ""right"" as his grandma. DH has told her no but I see this escalating quickly. It's mind boggling to me that she thinks she would be welcome in my home after the absolute poison she has been spewing about me. But she's also been so unhinged lately that I'm not surprised. 

I don't know how to stay NC and support my husband who is holding on to the hope that she'll snap out of it and be a ""normal"" grandma eventually. I really don't see a way back from where we are now. I don't want to resume contact but I see how much pain my DH is in with all this happening. How do I balance my safety and his well-being?",JUSTNOMIL
"So it’s been a looooong time since I posted and my posts are probably lost to BitchBot oblivion. 



To cut a long story short my PIL’s sent a letter to my now husband that was essentially urging him to abandon me before our wedding and that a long engagement didn’t mean you actually have to get married. We attempted to try and have a come to Jesus talk, which ended up with my MIL screaming at me she had never given me permission to call her by her first name.

OK then.





Fast forward to 2 years later we are happily married and settled, I am NC and DH is VVVLC. 



MIL is approaching a milestone birthday and FIL has sent an invite for said birthday.  I’m not interested, I can barely stand looking at the photo of her miserable face on the invite. I think she’s a nasty, manipulative piece of work. I’m not a fan of FIL either as his response to his son standing up for himself was that he would write him out the will. 



I’ve said to DH it’s up to him what he decides to do but I am not going, MIL (and FIL enabling her) crossed a line 2 years ago and I won’t ever forgive them. 



Some have said this might be them trying to bury the hatchet but if she really wanted to do that then say sorry, mistakes were made. She has refused to do that insisting she had the right to do what she did before the wedding.  I should according to her just “get over it”



No. The problem with SWMBO is no one has held their ground and told her to fuck off. I am never going to ease up on this. I am not brushing this under the carpet and acting like it never happened. 



She said she didn’t want a relationship with “those people” aka my family. Congrats you have your wish,  you will never have even the vaguest relationship with me, or my children if I ever have any. You are not welcome in my home, you are not welcome in my life. You got exactly what you asked for and I have said that to her face. 



This is not the first instance of denial that has occurred, word is that they have booked a large cottage down south for a holiday and are expecting us both to join them. Ha! No! We barely talk, we don’t like each other and spending a week in isolation is never going to happen. They are apparently genuinely confused as to why we wouldn't even entertain that idea.  



However, the problem is with these invites is I feel I am in an awkward position with DH’s friendly extended family. 

The outlaws would probably think that is them offering me an olive branch to make amends or some shite and while ideally, I would like to avoid hurting people’s feelings about their only living relative, in all honesty, I am done with dealing with well-meaning people trying to convince me to stand down. 



So how do I deal with this, my instinct says to be honest, and say sorry I can’t stand you, I have no interest in dealing with in-laws. I don’t care if they have a lonely old age, it’s all on them as far as I am concerned. 



Maybe that is heartless, but I wish to fuck people would stop expecting me to just lay down arms and surrender, she started this battle and she's not winning the war.",JUSTNOMIL
"My husband is a fantastic cook. I love him and his cooking. He makes these healthy meals that the kids gobble down without complaining there's vegetables in it. He makes special meals for us on date night. Everything would be fine if it weren't for my MIL. 

I hate this women. She has this massive ego and thinks she shits rainbows. She's a very successful chef. When I met my husband 10 years ago, he was training to take over one of her restaurants as a head chef. He didn't enjoy it as a job. After a while of dating, I encouraged him to go to university and do IT if that's really what he wanted to do. She didn't take to it too well. It ultimately took my FIL telling her to let the boy be and to knock it off when he told her about it. 

Time passed and she accepted it. Every time she comes to see the kids (4F and 2F) she insults me somehow by making some back handed comment about my husband doing the cooking. 

Last month the kids were having left over Mac and cheese when she showed up. She asked them if mommy made it  knowing full well my  husband would made it. She asks me where stuff is in the kitchen, but then would say you wouldn't know. 

I've spoken to my husband about this. He speaks to her, and she always says she will knock it off. She does for a short time, but just starts back up again.",JUSTNOMIL
"TW - miscarriage/infertility 


My MIL is insane. She’s been this way since I started dating DH. It’s crazy how well he turned out considering who his mother is. DH and I have been TTC for years. We got married almost 3 years ago and since our honeymoon, we’ve been trying. We had 2 miscarriages and a blighted ovum since trying. We finally found a fertility clinic that will help me out since I’m overweight by fertility clinic standards and it’s been a blessing but the price of medication is insane. When we miscarried last year, I knew our next step was a fertility comic and DH brought this up to his mom who said “don’t worry, I’ll help you out anyway I can for my grandchild”. Ever since then she’s been telling me that God does everything for a reason and blamed me having a UTI for our miscarriage and everything in between and even told DH to leave me for a “real woman” who can bring him a family. Well fast forward to this week and we got the okay to start IVF. However, just one of the medications is almost $5k. DH texted his mom about it since she’s well off and asked if we could borrow the money and explained the situation. She replied “Only God can give you a baby. Have faith in him and not man”. I’m furious. I don’t want to offend anyone, I do believe in God but I believe God created science and doctors to help in our modern world. She flat out said she won’t help with the medicine and in the same breathe told DH that it should be this hard to get pregnant. I’m so hurt and I’ve been crying hysterically for a couple hours. I wish so badly we could cut her off but she co-signed my husbands car and she won’t let us trade it in so we’re “attached” to her that way. I’m just over her bs and her controlling nature. I completely understand that she doesn’t have to give us money, I’m not upset over that, I’m upset over her sticking God into the conversation.",JUSTNOMIL
"Our child is 2.5. My MIL has never babysat, not even for 5 minutes. My anxiety began when I was about 6 months pregnant. I had a full blown panic attack and cried my eyes out in the shower for a good 30 minutes because I realized they thought they’d be able to babysit and take my child anywhere they wanted...But I didn’t trust them. At all. My anxiety turned into postpartum anxiety. And not just typical worries every mother has. Intrusive thoughts out of nowhere. Worries no one should have. 

But my distrust of my in-laws began almost 10 years ago. My SIL did a lot to ruin her relationship but I can’t blame her completely, they’ve done plenty on their own. She is a pathological, narcissistic liar and they fall for it all the freaking time. When I realized how much she lied, I called her out. And then all hell broke lose. All of a sudden I wasn’t good enough for any of them. All of a sudden I was controlling their son and trying to change everything about him. I’ve always wanted a sister and thought having a SIL would be awesome. I’ve always pictured going to watch chick flicks and getting pedicures with my MIL and SIL. Nope. Heartbreaking, really.

When we moved in together while we were dating and we got furniture...My MIL literally asked my now husband, “Well who is going to take what when y’all break up?” 

I couldn’t do anything right. I bought generic cleaning products to save us money...Nope, cleaning products should NEVER be generic. If I didn’t eat what MIL made for dinner I was SO disrespectful. If they planned a trip at the same time we had a trip planned for months, it was my fault that my husband stuck with our plans and went with me. 

His sister asked for a HUGE favor once. One that could be detrimental to our financial status. He asked me, coworkers, friends, mentors if he should do it. Not a single person said yes. When he told her no? It was completely my fault.

They almost didn’t come to our wedding. My husband was a disgrace for getting married in a church. He was “dead” to his mother. And they fucking hated me. They won’t say it, but they still do. And the wedding should have been all about him because that’s how they do things in their country. 

I could go on and on with these messed up scenarios. But basically, I’ve never been right for their son. Therefore, they also treat him like a screw-up. He’s literally amazing. I don’t know how he turned out the way he did, but I’m thankful. 

Fast-forward to when we have a baby...We had no one but us in the delivery room. We literally didn’t have my parents there JUST so his couldn’t flip out over how unfair that was that they weren’t invited too. I did not want to have them checking on us the whole time in their language. I wanted to know everything that was being said while I was in labor. It was just way less stressful that way. Well...They still aren’t over it. How DARE I not include them in MY birth! 

The way my MIL acted while I was on maternity leave was the final “Yeah, no way you’re watching my kid.” She would literally snatch him away if he started crying. Everything I did was wrong. I shouldn’t be holding him while he slept. I shouldn’t have breast-fed for so long, I breast-fed for 15 months. She only breast-fed her kids for a few months each and they turned out fine! I should have been giving him fruit and juice as soon as he started eating food. She didn’t care about his bedtime routine, we should have stayed over as late as they wanted us to. She wanted to control everything. I mean everything. And she was so harsh about it. When I started snapping back, she’d start telling my husband her opinions in their language as soon as I left the room. It was so obvious and rude. 

Now their side of the story is this. They don’t understand what they’ve done. I’m just mean. I don’t let them be grandparents. (they come over once a week, sometimes twice for at least an hour. My kid knows them. He calls them grandma and grandpa. And they bring him toys at least twice a month. We are overloaded with toys. They are definitely allowed to be grandparents and they are very obviously trying to make sure he’s attached to them.) My parents get to babysit while we work, it’s not fair that they get so much time with him. Also, they get pissed when we tell them not to come over when we’re sick. Who does that? I don’t want people over if we’re sick and I want people to warn me if they’re sick. Why would we spread unnecessary sickness?! Not to mention...These people cause me a LOT of stress and I’m already extremely stressed when my child is sick because anxiety. 

I feel like we will have this argument for the rest of our lives. Because I don’t feel like they’ll ever gain my trust. And even if they did...I will never in a million years trust his sister. And they always will. The second she has a chance to be alone with my son, she’ll take it. And I will not let her manipulate him for as long as I can prevent it. There’s no way they’d keep her from my son if they ever did babysit. And I haven’t spoken to her in year in a half. I don’t miss her drama one bit.

They use their language against me. If they want to ask my husband something that they don’t think I’ll agree to, they switch to their language. They blame it on not being as fluent in english. I call bullshit. My husband always replies to them in english. I fear if my child learns their language (he is half, after-all) they will use it against me even more.


Am I being irrational? Am I gonna regret not letting them babysit one day when I’m at their funerals? Will my husband resent me? They are the world’s best at guilt tripping their own son, his mom especially. 

I guess I just needed to remind myself why I can’t let them get to me. But I also need reassurance or other point of views. My anxiety makes me second guess myself a lot.",JUSTNOMIL
"So I went over things with my JNMIL that she has done since DD was born, you can read my past posts if you're interested. This might be a bit long because I just feel like I need to get this all out. 
She of course had excuses for all of her JN behavior.
To start off I brought up that she has continued to post DD's pictures on Facebook after I had repeatedly asked her to change her privacy settings. I can't even remember what excuses she had for that, but I got my point across and she removed all of the pictures she posted of DD.
I mentioned how she fed her peanut butter cookie when I explicitly told her NO SWEETS until DD had a taste for healthy food first. She said that I had told her that DD had already eaten some sweets, which I didn't tell her until after the cookie incident and I told her as much. She didn't have much to say about that.
She admitted that she doesn't want to give DD back to me when she holds her because ""She didn't know when she was going to see her again and doesn't get to hold her until an hour into our visit."" When we were going over there EVERY WEEK. 
She said that her husband's comment about sending me away was just a joke and I said that I know he says what he actually means then claims to be joking. Then she said it was because they feel like she won't ever want to spend time with anyone but me, even when she is older. She is just now 10 months old! 
I addressed that her Facebook posts also make it seem like she is DD's mother and I think that is what she is trying to be and she of course denied it.
I told her she shouldn't have taken DD from DH on Easter when she was sick and she said DH handed DD to her. I said""Oh did he? Because if he did he is in trouble."" And she says ""Oh I don't know, I can't remember now!"" DH is the scrapegoat of the family and she is constantly trying to make things his fault.
She helped us during a time when we were struggling when DD was first born by buying her things on the Facebook yardsale such as a walker that doesnt even work properly. So she said started on how she tries to help us and blah blah blah so I said ""This isn't about that."" And she shut up. I will no longer allow DH to accept her help at all because I don't see it as helping if you do it to throw it in someone's face.
I told her I feel as if she doesn't respect me as a mother because she doesn't follow my rules, I told her being a grandparent is a privilege and not a right and not to post or take pictures without my permission from now on.
I used to love my MIL, but now I've gotten to where I can't stand her. She didn't own up to anything she has done, and I know she knew what she was doing because it was like she came prepared with lies and excuses for the things I confronted her about. She will be lucky to see DD once a month from now on because I'm just sick of the disrespectful and toxic BS.
Oh, she also said she wants to babysit for just an hour. Why TF would anyone needs to be alone with my child for an hour?! 
I just needed to rant, thank you for reading! And thank you to everyone who gave me advice on my past posts, I'm getting much better at standing up for myself now because of it.",JUSTNOMIL
"TW for sexual abuse of a minor.  I'm new so I hope I do this right. I(53f) and my DH (49m) have been married for 15 years.  I'll give the cliff notes to the mil. Her and my husband's dad divorced in less than a year and fil moved to get away from her.  So my DH was left with crazy.  She married 7 times and they all beat her in front of DH.  She would drop him somewhere and be gone for weeks and he wouldn't even know the people.  She would also bring men to their one bdrm apartment and have sex with them after making him roll over and face the wall.  That is only a drop in the bucket as to what damage mil has done to mess him up.  Thing is that this cunt went to my father's church while I was growing up and no one knew she even had a son.  So guess who needed to save DH?  He never had shit.  I've worked since I was 14 and I spoil the ones I love.  Never been to the beach but he has now and everything else he's wanted. As in while I paid bills and dished cash his way he built 2 hotrods and is building another now, and 2 vintage drum sets that cost me big time.  Now as to what mil has done to me.  Just listing a small to the point few or I'll be typing my thumb to a nub.  

Accused of picking our last house because I would have woods to bury his body in.
Refused to come to the wedding if he married me.
Had a real estate agent take her to every house in the area we we're looking.
Stood at the top of the stairs after telling us she had seen the house already and said she felt death on our stairs (I said I could feel it too but she would need to move a little closer).
When I do anything she throws out that I'm more of a man than she is and cackles like a fucking hen. 
Shows up the morning we're leaving for his first beach trip and warns him it's too dangerous.  There are SHARKS in there and people pee in the water.
Gives me a pack of size 4x panties every Christmas for 15 years and when I look up, her and the sfil are smiling from ear to ear.  
Found a cornhusk doll in one of our barns on the wall and has told everyone I am a practicing witch.
Discovered she and thus my DH are distant cousins and went up to at least 3 (one being my husband's boss and told them I was married to his cousin AT MY MOM'S FUNERAL.
That's just the tip of the iceberg I have been NC for 4 years but I lost my mom and was not expecting him to turn his back on his.
Supposedly he was meeting his mom for Easter dinner with my sfil and my file because she wanted to introduce fil to one of her friends. Yeah except mil brought someone to meet DH too.
Now for my part in this.  Six years ago I became disabled and can't work.  I was denied disability and he makes too much money for me to get SSI.  He informed me two nights ago that he wants a divorce.  I have no money and no where to go.  Hopefully I can still get SSI now but who knows.  I used every cent of my retirement paying our bills and when that ran out we lost the house.  He's been bitching incessantly to my mil and some of my friends and family about having to drag my ass around and that I asked for too much.  Because of my disability I don't eat much at all and in the past year ordered one pack of underwear and socks. He told mil that and she told DH that her ""cousin"" ie my fdh said I was very spoiled and liked to drink imported beer. I've spent 4 years being treated like shit and my bf says it's all going to work out and not to worry until she takes me to a lawyer next week.

"This is the continuation of a pretty long story but I will include a short summary for those who haven't seen the first post. For those who are confused or what to know what happened I suggest reading [ The next move .....] that I uploaded two days ago and my other posts about MIL and my husband. 



Summary of the problem of the day with MIL :  MIL have been in  debt for years now because of her stupid spending (like spending 3.6k rent on a public housing worth 2.1k at most on a 1.5 salary.)  She's been in debt since I wasn't even in the picture. She uses this as a reason and ask money from husband the day before his pay day , everysingle month for the past 2 years + and leaves only chump change for me and BB to survive on . I end up having to beg and borrow from my parents and friends and rack up debt that way , and my husband won't see that him giving 65% ++ of his money to her as soon as he gets it and leaving us with nothing to spend is a terrible terrible idea.  He's flaky as hell , I'm losing faith and the ability to trust in him since he keeps breaking his words , not doing his duties and underperforming when it comes to responsibilities espically when his mother is involved. 


Timeline of funds -  the ONLY contribution he have done to the marriage and family so far. In his own words since he's the one with a job it's my duty to handle literally everything else and every single problem that pops up.  Even tho he doesn't provide much at all in reality and I end up financing myself with odd jobs I can do with a BB tag along / borrowing from parents.    🙄🙄🙄 this is the result after all that hot air ( and ofcourse after his mother takes all she can each month ) 

 pay days : 10th ( about 300+-  he says ) , 30th ( 1300 if full time ) 

Money provided by him since the beginning , two years ago - 

$80-100 per month for 2017 and more than half of 2018. 

$100-150 per month for the remaining months of 2018 

11 january 2019- $100

16 Feb 2019- $150

31 march -$600 ( highest , first time occurrence)

April - $0 

10 may - $400 

And......that it. In the world most expensive country currently - Singapore THIS is pretty sad as F.  Especially for someone who don't do anything with the excuse of I am the one with the job financing the family blablabla , he don't. This family survive because I pick up his slack, budget like crazy , pinch every penny except once in a blue moon  and do all I can to gather money so I can afford to fed and clothe my child. Mostly loans from friends and family , he doesn't borrow since its too embarrassing apperently and because he's so young all his friends are broke too. ....make sense .........if u arn't counting the fact that I am only one year older and is expected to do this very thing. 


So in February MIL ended up pulling a total of $1650 dollars from us in the entire month and I was FUMING . But not quite there at reaching the bottom of my tolorance. Close but not yet . 


March passed with a slight calm compared to usual which SHOULD have raised a flag but since I was busy preparing to  visit my parents in my birth country at this time it didn't. 

On 9th April i flew ,  and on  April 10th she made her move . This time my husband didn't even consult me he just up and gave her all the money , I was LIVID. Not that I could express it infront of them since it's Asia and he's a mama's boy with a temper problem ( anger clouds,  and as much as he says he loves me/ won't hurt me I am no longer under any illusion and find it hard pressed to believe in him when he's shown himself untrustworthy many many many times. Hasn't happened YET but I ain't going to go poking the sleeping bear to find out if it will  ) I finally put my foot down , still trying to manage my anger and called him to ask wtf ? How did ur mom get a hold of all our money and take more than $1100k the moment I left the country ? I managed to get through to him that I have reached the end.  That was it , I cannot tolorate this Bullshit anymore longer , something NEEDS to change. He kept giving out excuses and excuses for her and himself , that he couldn't  just abandon  his  mother , how could I be so heartless , how he's the only things  keeping her together and helping her ( she's able bodied , 40 year old, has a new husband AND and side D who's an on and off sugar daddy to her. She can work unlike me and  while it's true she still has a young child she leaves it up to her other older children to take care of her so it's not like she's a caretaker either. She cleans but barely cooks , works 4days out of a week..she's a train wreck yes but she not that helpless and pitiful as he think she is)  but  after many hrs I managed to get him to admit that it was indeed too far.  He gave his words to me of his own violation , his own idea- not what I wrangled out of him - that he would no longer keep saying yes all the time and that he will make sure to support us properly from now on. Minimum $750 each month will be given to us for living expenses he says.  Ofcourse I wanted to believe in him but he has a long track record so I decided to wait and see. I made up my mind ( after many venting posts on Reddit , asking questions, coming to terms with my fucked up reality and pulling my self together ) that I would treat this as the FINAL test. No more excuses , no more chances ..if he fails to keep his word this time that's it. I'm not going to divorce him or anything yet because ....Asia....and I'm in a pretty shaky standing with no method to support myself and my child properly ...yet. Divorce is also an extremely long tedious process with huge fees here .  But I would stop putting him first , caring about his needs or feelings before mine and start to distance myself a bit. I wouldn't keep trusting him only to be disappointed again and again anymore I vowed. This was it.. he didn't know it but what he did next month decided whether I would still consider him the love of my life - some one whose just down on his luck trying his hardest but not quite succeeding  OR someone who , while the heart is in a good place , is flaky as hell , irresponsible as fuck and just ain't worth trusting no more ...handle with caution from then on and no more trusting. 




Then it happened.  But it didn't even take a month . April 29th, 20 days after her last money grab and a day before we get our meager income , she came and asked us again.  This time she wanted ""only "" $700. But the thing is we still were to give her the monthly $600.  So that would be $1300 total. I blew my top when I saw her messages on the newly formed family group chat but didn't do anything . I waited to see what my Husband would do. Finally after a while of back and forth , her crying and fishing for pity , veiled threats like "" I will have to return to the ( her birth  country)   if you don't give me money ""  showing us her stack of bills which would have help her case.. ..if I didn't know how to fucking read properly. Her bills were about 100-300 per month and she's been letting it stack up for a while now , for more than six months at least. Her son's school bill wasn't paid , not the electrical bill, the water bill , gas , pH bill, WiFi . Nothing. The rent we pay each month is suppose to go towards paying for some of the PUB ( electric , water and gas combined ) at least ...we pay even when I'm not there using the damn place and racking up zero usage ourselfs. How the heck was I supposed to have sympathey for something like this ! It's a mess alright but she's done it all to herself.  ( In this six months she have went to hotel staycations , buy new TV , new pH , new WiFi , she have a $100 subscription to Netflix for fucks sake like .....wtf are you doing lady.  This is not ok ) 

This time for once he said no . I wouldn't lie , I was over the moon and got my hopes up.  He is showing signs of change, he might finally shape up  ! Our marriage may actually work instead of it turning into a farce where Im going to have to start joining them in their mains games in fucking eachother over just to defend myself and my BB.  Hurray ! 


Then the other shoe dropped. Out it came that he only made $930 for the month because of unpaid sick days and he couldn't even if he wanted to. I can't help but think if he had gotten his full salary ......he may have given in to her. But he didn't ! So...that's a plus point I guess. 

He still gave her $600 so  $330 left. Then a hundred for himself and $230 left for us. Which sounds great to him since hey , he gets a portion and I get a portion BB gets smaller portion, all's good right ? Duty done . But in reality that doesn't even cover this month's medical fees , my bb's immunization shots , heck I would still need three more hundreds  to afford it. He asked baout the sitch so I told him the details , He then told me he had $389 left and that he will send $300 to me to use .....but I know this trick. He's done it before . When he needs things he will come asking for money to me and make a whole sad kicked puppy debacle and act like I'm withholding his own salary from him to other people when I can't afford to give it. The only change is that the bulls won't be in his hands but mine.  That's the ONLy change that would happen. 

It's a whole mess again. He failed the test in mear 20 days . 20 days after saying all sort of things about how he gives his word and how important keeping his word is  to him.  ( And he really does keep his word , to his dead father to look after his mother , to his friends , work colleagues , army friends .....everyone BUT to his his wife and child) 

But at the same time he did finally say no to his mother for once. He kept this part of his promise ..even if it was influenced by this low salary this month  ..he still kept it. And he offered to give almost every penny he had to me so I can afford  to get the shots for my baby. He still won't borrow from ppl and I still need to borrow to actually be able to afford it ( it's like 500 total )  but he did put in the effort and the intent was there. Not 100% but still there. 


I don't know.  Should I give him another month and see how he does to decide my next step ?  After this final decision if I find him to be too undependable and a drain to the family.  Since while he does love us and the feelings are there a heoesn't really take care of us emotionally,  physically or financially . I'm ready to toss the whole man away out of my heart and start actively defending myself against more money grabs and their unreasonable requests , like her spontaneously leaving her kid with me without a word at home for days ,  stealing my food so I have nothing to eat repeatedly , tossing my things out etc etc.  Once I start protesting and defending my firm stance against any more of their BS , there will be conflicts and they will try to push/shame me back into submission. I have to cut off my feelings towards him , at least the ones that keeps wanting to out him first and foremost over everything and except that it may damage our relationship irreversibly of I really want to walk down this road. 


What do you guys think ? Should my flaky husband be given another final FINAL chance to prove himself next month since he does have those two positive things he did , where he said no to his mother this time and tried to give almost all he had to us ?  ( although I do reconize this last point to  be a bit shaky since this have happened before. But the only difference it made  was that the money was in  my hand instead of his physically and he didn't spend on too carelessly.  He still  spends , he just asks for the amount he need each time and if I don't or can't give  , he does the whole kicked puppy or salary abused husband card to his friends/colleagues     ............but this was last time tho.  I don't know if things will be different this time , it could be. He seem to really mean it this time ....... Then again in the heat of the moment he always means what he says , he just don't follow up later on .......damn this is hard . I want to trust and believe in him once more but ...gosh ). 


I don't know. His mom seems to be laying low for now so ..she may still be plotting something . Right now I still don't have this month's money in my hands yet. Bb's immunization date is on the 5th , he says he will give the $ on the 10th , I will probably have to ask a friend/ my mother to lend a hand until I can give back to them . Not sure what amount will really show up when the date comes. 

I don't have a good feeling about MIL's sudden silence in all this. Something's up and I don't know what. 



I'll update what happens when the 10th come for the final verdict of this whole train wreck episode. For now , all I can do is sit tight , wait and watch those two mother and son pair.",JUSTNOMIL
"So my brain is having anxious thoughts regarding exactly as I said it - me and DH are moving out of the ILs (thank god! 🙌🏻) and out of state.
Never had anything more than a one bedroom before, but we will be having a house! We are so very excited since we were recently married and our lives are *just* beginning :) 
That being said, both of our parents are already telling us when they are visiting us. The excuse used to be - “oh shoot! We only have one bedroom!”  Now that they know we have more than ample space, I am afraid that it will turn into big issues. My own parents buy tickets to fly out for other siblings, but no return flights! They typically just leave “when they are ready” after 2-3 months! I don’t want that for our lives. I see the affect it has on my siblings’ marriages and I don’t want that. 
So what are the best ways gently tell them the limitations and boundaries?",JUSTNOMIL
"Do any of you feel like your mil is mad at you for marrying HER babbbbbbbyyyyyyy???? Am I losing my mind, or is this a thing??

Help!!",JUSTNOMIL
"Tonight I started thinking back to my childhood and young adulthood and I got so heated that I feel like I need to rant about this.

My mom yelled for practically my whole childhood. And if you yelled back you were punished. Yes, I mean punished, not dealt appropriate consequences. I can't handle the noise of people yelling. It stresses me out so fucking much. I remember being so upset at her multiple times that she wasn't willing to hear me out or compromise that I would scream my lungs out over and over and over again until it hurt to even whisper. I would make my own throat raw and tender because of my anger of not being heard. 

I remember being thirteen or fourteen and my mom was in her bedroom on her computer. She never shut that thing when I was talking to her. She didn't seem to want to spend time with me. I explained this and the first thing she does is snap at me. She said ""I'm not always on my computer, I'm entitled to some alone time!"" What she didn't ever explain to me until I was about to leave home was how she had hypothyroidism which zapped all her energy by about 2 PM. I felt sad inside for all those times I asked her to go out and do things with me, but after that I felt so angry that she didn't feel like I deserved to know. If she'd just told me what was going on with her maybe I would have been able to be more considerate and expect less of her. 

Another thing she did was lie about why we moved so much. I counted fifteen different homes in between my birth and leaving home. When I was 8 or so I asked her why we move so much and she told me it was because she prayed about it and God told her to move. Well about five years ago I sat down and asked her frankly if that really was the reason. She said no, she just got bored with the house and it's layout so she wanted something new. Fuck that excuse. I was robbed of having any long term friends because of moving so much. I never developed close relationships with anybody in my neighborhood because I wasn't allowed to put roots down anywhere. I attribute her behavior as a huge trigger in my house-hunting OCD behavior. 

Another thing was that she favored my sister all growing up. Whatever M wanted she got. My parents bought her a new dress for every school dance, guess how many I got to pick out? ZERO. My sister got a 9k budget for her wedding. My budget? 1.5k. And then in the weeks leading up to the wedding, my parents did a shit ton of updating around the house. That's when I realized that I wasn't a priority. Something my parents told me was that they would only pay for one wedding. If I got a divorce I'd have to foot the bill for my second set of nuptials. My sister got a divorce and found a better man to be with. Guess what happened? They paid for a top of the line venue, the meal was catered, and she got to design a custom dress. My wedding gown was on sale at the bridal shop. My mom convinced me to not to a veil or headpiece, to do my hair myself, and my makeup too. My sister got all of these things in addition to real hair extensions, a limo rental, and my parents footed the bill for their honeymoon. I'm convinced that my mom only didn't want me to get those things because they wanted to put in new can lights and granite counter tops. Fuck that. Also, my sister wrecked two cars and they were replaced with one of the same value. One that was a few years old with maybe a 100k miles on it. What did I get? I turned sixteen in 2009 and I got a shitty 1990 Honda Accord that had paint chipping, the seats were all stained from my brothers using it, and then my oldest brother took the radio and subwoofers out of it (that my dad paid for, BTW) and my parents did nothing about it. 

I never had things that were just mine. I would go to school and come home and find out my bed had been swapped with my brother. One time I remember that I left my bedroom messy and came back to a spotless room, with a catch. She'd gone through my things and threw out at least half of it. Without consulting me about it first she would announce that we were switching bedrooms. I switched a bedroom with my sister and not long after my dad took her out to pick out what color paint she wanted for her new bedroom. 

My brothers scared me on purpose every chance they got and I can only remember a handful of times where my parents defended me. Most of the time they'd just say that I needed to lighten up and learn to take a joke. Now as an adult it doesn't surprise me that I have intense generalized anxiety.

Another fucked up thing that happened is that my dad got a memory foam king sized mattress from a mattress store when they were going to throw it out. He came home, cut it in half, and put one half in the guest room and gave my sister the other half.  I was promised that once my sister left home I would get the coveted mattress. I was sleeping on a decades old twin mattress so I looked forward to getting a decent mattress. Well my sister moved out just before my brother got married and I was pumped. I stripped my bed and moved the frame to a different spot in my bedroom. I went downstairs to grab the mattress my sister left behind only to see my parents storing it in the garage with the other half. I asked what was going on and they said they were giving both halves to my brother and his bride. I reminded them of their promise to give it to me and they merely shrugged and said sorry, too bad. They gave me a 'new' mattress but this one was thin and it had spaceships all over it. It didn't dig into me like the old one did but it was uncomfortable nonetheless because of how little spring back it had. It was like sleeping on a sad rectangle of concrete.

One of the most fucked up things my parents did was they would buy us kids a pet and then get rid of it a short while later without asking us or explaining why. I counted twenty one pets they did this to. The most notable was when I turned 9. I had been begging my parents for my own dog for months and months and on the morning of my birthday they gifted me a white poodle. I was thrilled and I became attached to him within minutes. Four weeks go by and Radar is nowhere to be seen when I got home. I asked my mom where he was, wondering if he'd run away. She sat me down on the sofa and told me that she'd taken him to the animal shelter to be put down. Apparently this dog was fifteen years old with three paws in the grave when we took him home. My parents gave me a dog and then killed it a month later. 

The dumbest fight I ever was a part of was when I was pregnant. I was with my mom and sister and the topic of holidays came up. I explained that my partner and I were not planning on doing Santa. My mom freaked out and lectured me for thirty minutes about how Santa is what makes Christmas magical. I explained that we didn't want to lie to our kids about something that they'd find out eventually anyway. She screams at me for ten more minutes and I'm bawling at that point. I grab my stuff and leave.

I was diagnosed with clinical depression a few years ago. I told my parents, and then I started treatment which included therapy and I'm still taking daily doses of antidepressants. Well my mom knew that I wasn't doing well. I called her up (this was back when I actually was holding onto hope that I would actually be helped by her. I explained where I was mentally and her response floored me. ""I wish you lived closer so I could be more help to you.""

What the fuck?! My mother-in-law was more helpful, she worked a full time job while being single, held down her own house and she lived fifteen minutes further away. And this next part will hopefully shock no one. My sister was dealing with postpartum depression after she delivered her second baby. For the next two years my mom would go and help her out taking care of the kids and cleaning her house. The kicker? My sister lived two streets away. Two fucking streets away. My mom would visit my sister and coddle her a few times a week for two years but she only came to visit me twice in the span of three? I never told her my mother-in-law would help me out a couple times a month when she had a free evening. To the best of my mom's knowledge I was being forced to handle my mental illness on my own with no more support than what my husband could give me. And this whole thing happened after I'd dealt with postpartum depression that made me suicidal for over a year (that then turned into my clinical depression) and she gave me the same fucking excuse of ""You live too far away wah wah wah.""

This last one might seem petty but it pissed me off nonetheless. My parents decided to gift each of the couples something special from them. My three siblings got gifts that cost upwards of $200. When I opened my package, I got bands for my FitBit, the rubber kind. I had been looking into getting some myself so I know you can get a set of like six for ten dollars. Only about twenty bucks was spent on my gifts and I was reminded again of how I'm such a low priority.

I know I didn't ever have to wonder if we would have food or clothes or shelter. But I'm still extremely bitter about it. My dad shaped up and he's treated me well for about fifteen years but my mom has never apologized for anything. Now that I'm an adult I realize how messed up my mom was when I was under her roof. She walks all over my dad, she's hypocritical, she spends money up the wazoo and she is incredibly manipulative. Every time we interact I wonder if I'm going to find out later that she was saying bullshit behind my back. I'm actually extremely close with my sister (which surprises me in hindsight) and she told me that my mom was making it out to be that I was a complete wreck who couldn't do anything at all other than sit in bed and stare at the ceiling.

For the past few months I've been saying no to going to our monthly family dinners. I've done things with my sister and her family without disclosing it to my brothers and parents.

I can't afford therapy at the moment so I was wondering if anyone can give me ideas of how to cope with the past and how to deal with my mom's bullshit in the present? I know the past is behind me and that I can't go back to fix what happened, but I feel like I'll always hold onto this anger until I can fully process and accept my childhood.

"Update! It’s very very long!! Still can’t flair sorry admin

So we went.... 

- Met at a birthday party for dear niece and she ignored me (you get that) after 45 minutes I started getting sly little digs “look mum I’m eating grass” “look mum my sock is falling off” 

-we left early because we had a prior engagement, sil2 goes “lets get a quick photo” mil “yes while the whole family is together” NEWS FLASH 3 of my kids were not there

-baby and I got back to mils after engagement while my husband stayed out (totally ok) I put baby to bed the day to chat with mil “do *our friends* have the kids”
Me “no they’re with their other parent” 
Mil “sil1 doesn’t have that luxury!” 
Me.......
Mil “xbil is so selfish he doesn’t care about the kids at all”
Me “she knew that before they had niece 2”
Mil “she wasn’t planned”
Me “if she dumped him one of the 20 times she said she would she wouldn’t have fallen pregnant to him”
(Nothing against my sil just can’t handle mil and her “my babies are so hard done by”)

-next morning baby and I go to church 6am mil wakes up at 8 “oh well you could never be bothered going when you were pregnant!” I was on bed rest and couldn’t drive 

-husband “we’ve started op shopping found some great stuff!” 
Mil “maybe jbabe won’t get mad at me like she did last time I bought one of the boys a jumper from the op shop” 
I got mad because she asked if we needed one I said no and she bought it anyway, why ask if you’re going to do what you want anyway.... but I’m the bitch for it.... 

-took her shopping because I was going she was silent unless she was trying to make me feel like an idiot “that lights green” “it’s your turn on the round about” “you know that bread has seeds in it” so I texted my husband when we got there saying I regretted taking her and he lost it said he’s sick of being in the middle because he was hungover and tired.... so I ended up not speaking to anyone until dinner... 

-the one time I left baby alone in the lounge room with her I was gone less than a minute and I came back and he was crying because she had to check his nappy “he smelled funny” I was gone less than a minute. 

-She appears to have given up showering and stinks all the time my husband brought that up first 

- we were supposed to be taking baby to the beach and having a sausage sizzle... he fell asleep until 1 then rather than going when he woke up so it was warm enough to go we had to wait for her ggchildren to get home from school 3 hours after that so I said “don’t bother we’re not going and I bought the food so better stop at the shops on the way” and left to get baby food because I didn’t want to use their food and have it held against me... 

-then either because she’s a bitch or because she forgot just didn’t cook dinner at all so me and sil1 did then all I heard about is how fussy me and my kids are (mostly allergies) husband jumped in and said I eat more than he does.... ggchildren don’t eat many different foods at all 

-set presents and hand me downs for the kids the boys all got good quality clothes and shoes the dress the got my daughter had so many holes in it she couldn’t wear it thankfully I didn’t give anything just put it in their draws so no one noticed 

These aren’t huge issues but just being attacked every time I open my mouth is killing me and the differences between the children is fucked and part of the reason she’s not allowed alone with them",JUSTNOMIL
"So after I deleted MIL off all social media and was keeping her off FT with DH, he moved out here to where we were and started sending her daily photos and videos and FaceTiming her. She has yet to speak to me, yet to apologize, yet to apologize through DH. I’m pretty mad about the whole situation still. I feel like there’s no “consequences” for treating me, LO, and my dad like crap. I’ve brought it up that we still aren’t speaking and he said “I’m hoping you’ll get over it and forget about it.” I don’t want to forgive her, it was a super shitty thing that she doesn’t even care that she did and I’m sure she feels totally in the right. I’m not really sure what to do here. I don’t think this really falls under MIL but I figured you guys deal with these situations more than anyone.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi, been awhile. Mother has been behaving until the other night. Would also include an additional story of a win after the TLDR.

If you're too lazy to check the bot, I'm the OP whose mildly No turned JN Mother tried to convince me to use lemon essential oils to cure the common cold. Didn't happen due to me being a lurker in this sub and r/AntiMLM. I know that shit could kill me.

In my previous post (she reenacted a famous scene from The Shining, minus the axe), I mentioned that I was job hunting. I had offers but turned down most of them due to the skills the positions offered to me, I am flattered they think so highly of me but I was lucky that I even managed to create those designs for my portfolio. Kinda felt I was lying to them. I applied for 3 companies that could possibly send me overseas and applications getting approved could take weeks.

It has been 3 weeks since I applied and no feedback yet. I feel miserable. All negative thoughts in my head. My friends and peers are getting employed, left and right. I feel like I'm getting left behind and the frustration gave me an art block. I'm an art student, to be unable to create is torture. I'm scared that if the art block goes on or I get no answer back, I might self harm impulsively..

Because Mother was behaving I turned to her for reassurance. Told her everything I've been feeling for a month now. And you know what she said?

""Have you been praying enough?""

When those words left her mouth, I knew I made a mistake in telling her. Oh, you failed a subject? Pray for a better grade next time. You and your friend had a falling out? Pray to God she forgive and forget so you two can be friends again. Typhoon ______ is coming to our area? Pray we don't die and if we do, pray harder so we meet in heaven.

Mother is a busy woman and I get that religion is her way of comforting me but I'm sick and tired of being told I should turn to God for my troubles my whole life. I don't want God to help me, God doesn't give you the answer you need right now, God is too busy being God. I wanted my Mother, a person of flesh and thought. I needed my Mother and whenever I need her the most, she would turn away hoping God fixed me out. No sense going to my Father for comfort, talking emotions with that man is like talking to a brick wall covered with barbed wire.

No offense to religious people here. But when your parents introduced God as a genie to you, it's obvious you turn out agnostic or atheist. I'm the former.

Now back to her answer, I replied very VERY angrily. ""This matter is outside of prayers Ma."" She didn't like that one bit. Got worse when she demanded to know when was the last time I prayed and I just clenched my jaw shut. Threw a small tantrum then stomped upstairs to their bedroom and slammed the door.

I knew saying that pricked her ego and it felt good for a while before I faced reality again. Mother, again, rugswept the whole thing but she hasn't been mentioning anything religious for a few days now. I bet when someone close to us dies this year or I finally get employed, she'll be back all smug with the effectiveness of God and her prayers.

TLDR: Turned to Mother for comfort about lack of response from possible employers, she tried to use religion to solve everything. Threw a mini tantrum when I implied my lack of faith.

BONUS STORY.

During April, we celebrated Holy Week. If you aren't familiar with that, basically the Philippines goes into full religious mode. Singing Psalms, having prayer meetings at designated houses, Mysteries of the Crucifix, fasting, etc. Also, government holidays.

My family and I went to this beautiful resort in Southern Luzon that went trending a few years back. Their main attraction is dining in a man made waterfall. Obviously when you're there, you should take lots of photos. Especially at the waterfalls. I hate getting my picture taken, would tolerate family photos but if it's just me then I would use the most fakest smile I have.

Mother wanted me to post and smile for everything during the day tour but I would make a face that I know she cannot post online. She finally got fed up and confronted me about purposely ruining her photos. I told her I have no trouble smiling properly for family and group photos but photos of just me are out. She tried to use the, ""but we don't go out to places like this all the time,"" card. When I asked her when did that ever worked on me, she went quiet.

She took photos of Father and my younger sister but not of me, except in group photos. A week after, we went to two family reunions from Father's side and I was left alone except for the scheduled family photos. I hardly couldn't believed it and celebrated by getting drunk alone. A rare win for me!",JUSTNOMIL
"It's been a while....JB is here with FIL as well for a visit (they originally came because oldest daughter graduated kindergarten) and they wanted to be here for it. Well they realized that my DH would be gone TDY for a week and so they've brought it upon themselves to stay longer than originally discussed. Why do they never ask?! Granted, them being here will definitely help seeing as how my youngest has some medical appointments and it would be easier to leave oldest with them...but make sure it's ok first. 

&amp;#x200B;

My issue is that my house is a damn mess and it is driving me crazy. They leave crap everywhere and then JB insists on doing the dishes for me, but puts things where SHE thinks they should go so...I can't find anything. Then she decides to wrap the leftovers from dinner in my good china, instead of using the TUPPERWARE that is staring her straight in the face. She did my laundry without asking me first which really really pisses me off because it means she went into the master bedroom and took them from the closet. Also, the last time they were here I was visiting my mom who's in home hospice, and apparently DH decided to offer up our deluxe shower for them to shower in. Great. So now, the guest bath isn't good enough and they only want to take showers in ours. DH and I have sex in that shower sometimes. He couldn't understand why I got upset about it. ITS MY SHOWER DAMMIT! Can't I have one thing that isn't for everyone else's enjoyment?! This is our private space. I don't want them snooping through my stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

She made some seriously weird comments about things as well. I came down in a dress the other night because DH and I were going out to dinner and she said ""Ohhhh I know someone's getting laid tonight.""  What....the....hell?! She's the weirdest catholic I've ever come into contact with. Apparently, she also thinks she owns rights to the TV. This morning I had it on Mickey Mouse Clubhouse for my youngest to watch and she sauntered on into the living room and changed it without asking. The TV is on CONSTANTLY and they watch things that both girls should not be seeing/hearing.

"Sorry this will be long; I am venting. DH and I have a long, challenging relationship with his mom, my MIL. I was a sweet little rube when I met her. Not any more. Highlights have included:
-Insisting we have lunch with “just her” the morning after our destination wedding because she needed to “ feel special”.
-Worming her way into the delivery room 11 years ago when our only DD was born, violating the birth plan she wouldn’t read, and then taking DD from the nurse, bragging “I am the first person to ever hold you.”
-Coming to our house high on Ambien and dropping DD, followed by a few years of near misses and blatant anger and refusal to honor any request.
-Running passive aggressive commentary on how superior in every way DH, DHs sister, and MIL are in every way and how DD is the exact spitting image of DH and DHs sister. Honestly, if MIL could have had a grandchild conceived by DH and his sister, I think her life would be complete.
Over the years, DH has worked really hard with me to manage these situations. We went to therapy by ourselves (and with her) to the tune of several thousand dollars. Therapist finally told us there was no point in continuing on with MIL and expecting change, just to set expectations and what we “need, want, prefer” and establish strong boundaries.
Also, I have developed a thicker skin and we don’t see her more than about once per month for a set timeframe.
Success, yes? 
Enter this summer: a very close family member of DH is getting married at a destination wedding out of state. The faction of our family traveling together includes DH, DD, MIL, me, plus SIL and nephew. We have rented a large home where MIL will have a master suite on the first floor and the rest of us will have rooms/suites upstairs. I was feeling pretty good about being old and Jedi enough to be okay with this 8 day trip until last week when MIL showed up unannounced at my FIL’s (they divorced 35 years ago) family dinner night and began letting us all know that she will be the family matriarch on this trip and that we, and all the other family in attendance need to honor and respect that. That, in addition, we need to let her have her moment and lavish her with deference and attention.
Just for perspective, this will be the 50 year old bride’s first wedding. She has a mom still living who is a lovely person. Bride’s father was MIL’s brother and passed away a decade ago. There are many, many major players at this wedding before the six of us, as it should be!
Anyway, during MIL’s lecture during dinner, my closet of anxieties burst open and all the old manipulative behavior (MIL using social situations and pills to leverage control) flashed through my mind. As my blood pressure spiked and my throat closed up, a moment of clarity as to exactly what a naive little rube I still am for getting myself, DH and DD into this situation by agreeing to go, flashed through my mind and has done so ever since.

"My son is only 1, so he doesn’t understand right now. But when my husband told MIL we were growing his hair out, she looked at my son and said “oh no! Then the other kids will make fun of you and we don’t want that, do we?” 

I was not there when this happened, but I’d like to address it because I will be damned if she makes these kind of comments when my son is old enough to understand. Does anyone have any advice for what to say to her about this situation? I want my son to be secure and confident in who he is, and I don’t want him to be so concerned about what other people think that he forgets to love himself, too (this happened with my husband growing up because of her.)

Edit: this is what I was considering sending her, but if anyone has any other ideas I’d appreciate it! I don’t want to come off too brash - I’ve had to correct her before and it started a mini war between the whole family (eyeroll!!) I want to be firm but not hateful. 

Anyways, here it is: I do not appreciate your response when [husband] told you that we were growing [son’s] hair out. Telling him that the other kids would make fun of him is completely inappropriate and out of line, and if he were older, I would be furious at you for bullying him and making him feel insecure. We are raising him to be confident in who he is, and we are raising him to love himself rather than be so concerned with what everyone thinks of him that he hates himself inside. [husband] does not want [son] to go through what he went through growing up. Not only was it a cruel comment to make to your grandson, but it was a slam on our parenting choices and that is something we don’t appreciate and will no longer tolerate. I know you cherish your time with him, so I know you will refrain from making comments like this again. Thanks!",JUSTNOMIL
"Ive been NC with my ‘Parents’ for well over 2 years now. 


I divorced back then, and when I turned to my parents for support my Mom kicked me whilst I was down and made me feel like I’d be better off dead.  Typical narcissistic bullshit, you know?  She made it all about her, and basically called me stupid and inferred that I was going to die old and alone with cats eating my face. Her yelling at me and being a complete chunt lead to me taking a bloody good look at our relationship and I barreled out of the fog like a quaterhorse at a rodeo. 
My ex got my parents in the divorce, I laughingly say.  Which is quite funny, because he always hated her!! 


I’ve been in a funny space lately.  Things you don’t deal with keep coming back to you, you know? So thoughts of my Dad have been coming to me.  I always figured he was the weak arse enabler, but I did love him, and always thought if he reached out that maybe, just maybe, we could have some kind of relationship.  


I had a random day off on a day I usually work, and, it seems, my parents were hanging out visiting my ex in my city. I went shopping at the local mall, and I see my parents coming up the escalator as I’m going down.  I’m ok, just think, ‘oh for fucks sake’ and I look at them.  


They’re smaller to me, now.  Fully grey and bent over.  My mother was wearing her usual CBF and had her head tilted towards my Dad, who was frowning at her and looking quite cranky.  He looks super old and grey; she really has sucked the life out of him.  
That dissatisfaction with life has hollowed them out, and I thought that my ‘mother’, dressed in a beige turtleneck, looked all the world like a beige puckered up cats asshole.  


We hit the same footing on the escalator.  They’re just a couple feet from me, I look right at them....and they look right through me.  Not in a ‘we see you, but are going to pretend not to’ kinda way.  They looked right through me and I didn’t even register.  I was a complete stranger to them.  
I went on down and they went on up, and in that moment it hit me.  They truly did not recognise me, not because they have changed, but because *I* have.  
I’ve changed my routines.  I’ve changed my dressstyle.  I stand tall.  I’m confident.  I take up space, you know?  And they didn’t see me because I’m not ‘her’ anymore.  Not the doormat.  Not the SC.  Not theirs any longer.  


I truly believe that life is like a gigantic solar system, and people who are important to you are in your orbit.  Planets, stars are always there, but some come through like comets and leave again. My life has changed so much that my parents have completely bounced out of my solar system.  


Today, I wore a cloak of invisibility and it felt like a superpower.  I’ve never been more grateful for all the hard work I’ve put in to myself to be ok with it.  I’ve finally achieved optimal Meh.",JUSTNOMIL
"As I mentioned in my first post, my family is super religious. As a teen I started moving away from this, due to boredom and just general teenage exploration into things considered verboten. Liiike sex! Oh boy!

&amp;#x200B;

This might be long...

&amp;#x200B;

Back in 2006 I was big into the Yahoo chat rooms. I was ""dating"" a guy I'd met there, he lived in the States and was coming to visit/meet me in Europe around the time I was graduating high school. That visit will be for another story. This story is about the trip I took to see him a few months later, against all the advice and almost commands from my parents, mother especially.

&amp;#x200B;

Up until this point, I was still ""technically a virgin"". During his trip to see me we engaged in oral, of course, and like a good Christian girl I only did anal, no vaginal sex. During my trip to see him, it was his birthday, so we had vaginal sex for the first time. It was his first time too, he like me was also saving himself for marriage but for different reasons (that relationship was all sorts of fucked up, let's not get into that now :P ). This was also the time when Myspace was still popular and everyone would post those dumb quizzes (I'm really dating myself now). I decided it'd be fun to do one of those quizzes while on my trip, and it contained the question ""ever had sex in a car?"" to which my dumb ass answered ""not yet lol"". Long story short, a youth pastor friend of mine saw the post and told my parents, so when I got back from my trip they were waiting for me. Good to know is I had just turned 20 that summer (international move meant restarting grades meant late graduation).

&amp;#x200B;

Within the first week of my being back home, my mother ambushed me with this quiz. She'd printed out copies for our family meeting, so both she and my dad could read along together. During this meeting she confronted me, asking if I'd had sex, if I used protection, if I understood that ""having sex with someone ties your soul to theirs, which opens up the gates for all sorts of evil to come into your own spirit and mess up your own life"". I just sat there, embarrassed that they knew, mad at myself for answering that damn quiz, and hurt that a friend I trusted felt the need to tattle on me. My mother saw I wasn't going to respond to their questions and comments, so she excused my dad (who couldn't get out of there fast enough) and then proceeded to grab my hands in the ""human lie detector"" position and stared into my eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

""Did you like the sex, Petite? Did you enjoy it?""

I nodded, not daring to break eye contact.

""I know, I can see that promiscuous spirit in your eyes. We need to pray it out""

At which point she immediately starts hardcore praying in tongues, with occasional phrases in English of ""Oh heavenly father cast out that demon!""

I just sat there, trying to figure out wtf was happening. I was being made to feel dirty about something I had enjoyed and cherished, and I was too scared to just get up and go.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually after more praying away my promiscuous spirit, I don't remember how long that went on, she let me go so I could get to bed. Things sort of died down after that, there were no more exorcisms or big prayer meetings, but there was definitely tension, and on top of it all, I lost a close friend.",JUSTNOMIL
"I’m definitely not okay with this.

Back story: this is the same woman that kept calling my newborn son HER baby and I shut that down. She’s also the one that threw a hissy fit when I said no face kisses. Granted, I said that one a bit harshly but I don’t feel bad. 

My little boy is almost four months old so he’s starting teething. My hubby felt the tops of his gums and we felt that hardness that seems like a tooth ready to be coming. I posted on Facebook that he seems to be having teeth coming in.

She comments “I thought I felt that yesterday”.

Wait. What?

So your fingers were in my son’s mouth. I ask my husband about it and he says he had no clue. He was helping his aunt and uncle move while I was at work so she watched our son. So now I’m pissed.

How do I handle this? I told him not my circus, not my monkeys, and that he needs to say something. Until he says something, my sons not visiting her. And if she does it again, time out.

Am I overreacting? Or do I have every right to be livid that she keeps finding ways to piss me off?

Update: its my D(amn)H’s fault. He mentioned to her that sometimes he will let our son kinda gum his finger to soothe him so he planted the idea in her head.

He will be letting her know that I don’t want anyone doing that and he will do it more gently than I would.",JUSTNOMIL
"I posted a few weeks ago and I’m trying to go in order with my stories as to not be confusing. I’m not sure if my MIL gives off Jocasta vibes like I’ve seen in this sub, but here we go. 

As previously stated, DH did a long distance relationship as he is in the military. While we were dating, we “broke up.” Weird stage where we were both under a lot of pressure and stress and it was honestly a mess. Nothing really changed between us. He was stationed in a different country and it was hard. When his mom found out we broke up, he told me that she said she was happy because now she can talk to him more. Which didn’t actually happen because we were still together kind of...

Anyway, since he was in a different country we had to use a different app to text each other. On the app you can see when the person is online and active and it was just a coincidence that she happened to call EVERY single time we were on the phone with each other. And he sometimes would answer sometimes not. We talked once every 1-2 weeks for maybe an hour because of her so it was extremely annoying. 

So anyway, he comes home on leave and we get back together...even though we were technically never apart. Confusing. 

She was not happy and said that he was making a mistake and that I’m only going to break his heart. His sisters said the same thing. 

I’ll have to post the story of our engagement a different time, but we recently got married in the past year and she is a wreck trying to one up my constantly. The whole time before we were married she tried to insert herself into our relationship by asking VERY personal questions. Including questions about our sex life and what we do. 

I absolute feel uncomfortable around her and I’m happy to be able to post here. 

TLDR; mil not happy about our relationship and asking personal questions to try to insert herself",JUSTNOMIL
"In-laws have come and gone and it was about as hellacious as I expected. I'll be posting about my FIL on the appropriate sub soon, but my MIL is where my rage is currently focused. 

My MIL whinges a lot, which I was well aware of beforehand, but this last visit they stayed with us for the first time and holy shit was it worse than I expected particularly because she never complained about anything to me directly. In fact, everything was overheard because she barely spoke to me at all... despite staying in my house... for over a week. Most of their time was spent at our house with me while DH was at work and my MIL wouldn't speak to me at all if DH wasn't home. And despite that, when my mom(who is usually JustNo but was very JustYes when my ILs were here) took the ILs off our hands for a few days(ILs planned it ahead of time), my MIL told my mom that she was upset I only did one thing with them(remember she ignored my existence the entire time) and it made her feel like she could never come back. Not going to lie, my initial reaction was to send my mom the Grumpy Cat ""Good"" meme in response to the text she sent letting me know what was being said. 

Other BEC things include my MIL not picking up after herself, breaking three pieces of furniture, one of which was delivered the day before the ILs arrived, and damaging a brand new baking pan by scrubbing it with an abrasive pad. And with that last one, I saw her start to scrub it and told her to stop but she didn't so I took the pad from her hand and then she cried to DH about how mean I was.

But what has me really heated(and this is where I need advice) is that she stressed DH out the entire trip by complaining about not seeing him enough. Now without giving too much away since this isn't my main account, my DH works a job that is very demanding on his time. He has a high requirement for the number of hours he works annually and constant flow of new work coming in all with regimented deadlines. Taking time off requires pre-planning months in advance and offloading work onto his colleagues. Some of you may recall me mentioning in previous posts that we recently moved and he had to take time off for that, so he really couldn't take much time off while his parents were here. And they were warned ahead of time and he suggested they visit later in the year, but they insisted they could only come during the time they were here. And despite all that, DH, who usually works 9-10 hour days cut his workdays down to 5-6 hours while his parents were here. Unfortunately that wasn't good enough for them and my MIL complained about it relentlessly to him. It's like despite his warnings, she expected him to take the entire length of their trip off work. 

MIL complained so much she almost got DH to agree to pick them up from my parents' house a day early, but I said no, because 1) I said they could only stay with us for x number of days and they had already booked their trip in a way that required them to stay with us more than that, 2) DH needed that extra day and a half with them at my parents's  house to get work done, and 3) they planned their trip to stay with my parents for several days including a weekend after DH told them he could set weekends aside for them and I wasn't going to allow them to change the plans without consulting me because they regretted their choices. You guys, that's the shiniest my spine has ever been. My MIL didn't like that at all and accused me of keeping her son away from her. But of course she didn't say that to me, she said it to my own mother. 

So here's my dilemma: DH was so fed up by the end of the trip that he's not sure he wants his parents to come stay with us again, but since they only visit once a year I'm worried he'll forget how much stress they caused him and will allow them to come again. I personally don't want them to stay in my home again at all, but particularly not if they're going to complain about not seeing him enough. Part of me wants to reach out to them and tell them that they're not welcome if they can't be understanding and respectful of DH's work requirements, but I don't know if that's wise given my lack of relationship with them. I also worry MIL will take my standing up for DH and his needs as me keeping him from her. What should I do?

EDITED TO ADD: I almost forgot the most BEC complaint my MIL repeatedly made... she kept complaining that there wasn't anywhere comfortable to sit because our new couches hadn't been delivered yet. She knew they wouldn't be here before she and my FIL visited but we would have dining chairs, patio chairs, and bar stools. DH and I find the previously mentioned chairs comfortable, but MIL claims they were horrible to sit on for more than half an hour.",JUSTNOMIL
"Soooooo! For those of you who follow me may know that last Sunday my DS (9months) and I were in a car rear-ended accident. First I'd like to start off with saying that my son and I luckly are both okay.

So back to the reason for my post. My Just YES! father and YES step-mom (Jan) were visiting me for the long weekend. Well had to run to the store and they let me use their car while DH was at work. They stayed at the house because the store is 3 minutes down the road, I only took my son because I was going to let him pick out a new rubber ducky (his favorite toy). Well on the way home we we're rear ended pretty badly. So here's the process of everything I did, after I made sure we were both okay:

1st.) I called 911 and told them what happen. 
2nd.) I called my parents because it was their car! 
3rd.) I called DH at work. 

I did not call MIL to tell her what happen yet because in my mind she wasn't a priority. Although she had been texting me ""are you home... hello?...why aren't you answering me!?"" All in a span of 5 minutes. But k was dealing with my screaming son, police and the guy who hit me! 
Well MIL called DH to bitch about me not answering and he told her I was in a car accident with DS. I so wish he hadn't because the next thing she did was track my phone view her daughter's Snapchat. And went to the accident.

Now by the time MIL got there everything was crazy. My parents ask my wonderfully nice neighbors if they could bring them to the accident (they just gave them their car) because I for one have never been in an accident before, it was their car, and they also needed to give the police the insurance information. Anyways she was getting in the way of EMS trying to look my son and I over and I ended up not getting looked at because MIL kept trying to take DS away from the Paramedic and I.  MIL kept bitching about how I didn't call her and called my parents instead, she was absolutely livid with me for it. Then Bitched that we should just got home instead of the hospital and that we don't need medical attention even though I kept saying I wanted to go because I could barely focus or see straight and I just felt awful. After the 6th bitching Jan stepped in and said ""No they are going to the hospital.""

After a whole of sitting around. The Paramedic went to grab paperwork and in come MIL swooping DS out of my lap. Well he starts crying again and as soon as he sees Jan he practically jumped out of MILs arms into Jan's. And Jan gave him right back to me because we were leaving to go to the hospital. So my parents said goodbye and headed back home in a taxi.

The hospital we went to was unfortunately the one my just no FIL works at as security. So FIL and my DH were already there waiting for us to arrive. Soon after arrival MIL with SIL and then the grandma in law all pull up as well all demanded to be there...

After DS got check out and was fine. It starting to get late and way past DS bedtime. So DH asked grandma in law to take him home and put him to bed. And she was more than Happy to and MIL and SIL went to go get food and then go to our house to see DS. 

Now for the part that really bugged me and made me feel physically uncomfortable. It was my turn to be looked over. No one and asked until that point other than my parents and DH. How I was. So I told the nurse I felt dizzy and my left side was numb and my back and neck hurt an awful lot. so she asked why I wasn't in a neck brace? I explained I was never looked at during the accident by EMS. So I had to go get a CT scan and an MRI.   
Well to do this I was asked to take my clothes off And wear a hospital issued robe. DURING THIS WHOLE TIME FIL STAYED IN THE ROOM! (like wtf!!) DH was also on the room and FIL stayed behind the curtain until I was in just a robe and did not want him In the room with us. I felt overly exposed and very uncomfortable. And just wanted everything to be over with. He didn't leave once. 

Eventually around 10pm we heard back that I had a cervical sprain but was free to go home. And DH and MIL talked a little bit downstairs while I check on DS who was soundly asleep by then and in some weird pjs I've never seen before.

 Once MIL leaves DH looks pissed off so I ask him what's wrong and he has my stepmother is a huge issue! Apparently MIL had told him that Jam was very rude to her and acted snooty and kept taking DS away from MIl and acting like DS was Jans baby not ours. She also said that I act liked a completely different person around Jan. And all I can think is for one my head was super messed up from the accident and I couldn't even think or move without wanting to hurl or pass out.  And non of that was true. I didn't even want MIL at the accident or the hospital! 

WellDH sided with his mother and is still upset with Jan (they don't have the best relationship, for another day though) and so DH starts calling Jan a ton of swear words and hope she dies. Even though I was so greatful to have my parents there because they handled everything for me and made sure DS and I were taken care of.  

Now I guess my advice is more for r/relationshipshipadvice but I guess I don't know how to get DH to see that MIL is in the wrong and not my stepmom.  And also how to deal with MIL straight out causing tons of drama that I did not need that night.",JUSTNOMIL
"So kind of need to share, I just giggled like crazy but my JMMom won't let me share with DH so I am sharing with you lovely people.

So after our NC with MIL and fam I had noticed one SIL had unfriend me on the book of faces. Whateves, figured MIL had shared stuff with her and didn't blame her. Fast forward a couple of months and JNMIL out of nowhere straight up BLOCKED me on the book of faces. I for some reason have found this funny . She was the one who suggested the NC because she can't respect her adult child. The only thing I could figure was she was getting annoyed because we weren't suffering with her out of the picture. Bad news for her, I'm the active one, so she now has to go through the last SIL to find out what we do (I'd asked for advice here and it was suggested that I leave this last SIL on the book unless she does something blatant FM-ish).

So fast forward again to recent. My own mom has grown alot and has gone from JN/JM to working on JM-JY. So we were chatting on the phone and turns out when JNMIL blocked me, she blocked my mom as well. She wants me out of her sphere so much she straight up BLOCKED a woman who has one of the most inactive accounts in the history of social media. So we both had a good long chuckle over the extent that this woman goes to. Just more fuel for me to keep the NC when DH starts talking to her again. 

And as always, thank you, you wonderful community, for advice you give and sharing of your own hardships and successes.",JUSTNOMIL

A few weeks ago, BonBon was admitted to the hospital for seizures. Turns out she has 19 malignant tumors in her hypocampis. 

She will most likely die from this. 

I am not sad. 

She has, if you’ll recall, insulted me, my child, and my family. Multiple times. 

I’m also pissed because despite having uncontrollable seizures, she continues to drive. I have epilepsy that’s well controlled. There was a time when it wasn’t. I never ever *fucking ever* drove. Because if o had a seizure behind the wheel, it may kill not only me but children as well. I literally begged her not to drive. She insists upon driving. 

So. BonBon will likely die from this. I’m not sad. Brain cancer can affect personality. Hers has taken a turn for the worse. She called the valet a “good n****r boy.”

What the fuck BonBon. All of her racist tendencies have taken hold. And my in laws all excuse it because cancer. Nah. This isn’t the cancer talking. She’s always been like this. She’s just more open about it now that death is feverishly knocking on her door and she knows y’all will let her get away with it. 

She’s blaming me for my husband not being able to fly across the country to see her. Couldn’t be that I have upcoming surgery, (that insurance isn’t paying for), we need a new roof, the car needs new brakes, and we’re spending $6500 so my kid can get braces. Oh no. Clearly I’ve spent all our money on frivolous shit. Excuse the fuck outta me for spending one goddamn hour every two weeks for a gel manicure. Bitch I work hard so forgive me for some $30 me time every other fucking week. 

She doesn’t have much in the way of assets. She’s now threatening to cut my husband out of the will unless he, and I quote, “divorces that unhinged, baby killing, Trump hating whore of a wife.” Look y’all. I ain’t looking into a political debate but my husband is a Trump supporter. I am not. We make it work. My husband shouldn’t be denied family pictures and heirlooms because of my personal beliefs. Nor are we willing to lie about our beliefs. I sure as shit am not going to compromise my dearly held convictions so I can get a goddamn gravy boat or a picture of her in high school. 

Meanwhile, my husband is very upset. Which I totally understand. I’m trying to be there for him as best I can. I’m also dealing with a tweenager, and being on call as a property manager. Sometimes, I need a fucking break. 

BonBon- just die already. That sounds Cersei Lannister cold but I mean it. She’s milking that whole “I could die” shit for years and it’s getting old. Just die, let us grieve (or let me party), and we can move on.

"So Catholic Creature did not ACTUALLY shit on a chair, but her dog sure did and she left it for me to clean up. But that's not exactly what I am posting about right now. 

I'm posting about her notes, which are laughable and rage-inducing.

So Nana is doing GREAT in the senior's home and family has been taking turns checking on her now-empty home. We write notes on a pad to let each other know when we were there and anything of importance to share.

In general, the notes have been...

""Date - X was here, checked X, cleaned X, all good!""

DH and I were there recently. Cleaned bathrooms, did dishes, took out garbages (which were OVERFLOWING with ROTTEN food and other nasty), packed some of DH's stuff. Added this to the note.

We went back a few days later. Two new notes added. These are paraphrased. I have photos but don't feel like transcribing &amp; they have personal info in them. 

First from Uncle: ""I picked up Nana's jewellery and put it in a lock box! Thank you Digi and DH for cleaning! The place looks great!""

Next, from CC: ""I took out the garbage that Digi and DH left. Uncle, great idea about the jewellery, as you, Aunt, and I are not the only ones with keys. Thanks.""

I don't think you really have to read between the lines here to understand that she's fucking pre-emptively accusing us of theft. I was LIVID when I read this. Took photos. Continued packing. Added to the note without responding to CC. 

Today, DH went back to finish packing. There was a new note from CC. He didn't take a photo, but he said it said, ""You aren't allowed to take anything you didn't pay for.""

Family is aware that Nana, prior to her dementia hitting hard as well as throughout all of this, has offered us some furniture, which we were intending on taking. Family other than CC is supportive. But I'm fucking scared now.

We move soon. Not going to give a specific date here because we are keeping it down low. But dear goodness. I cannot wait until we are like...... actually.......... NC....",JUSTNOMIL
"I've posted before but delete it because I worry they will find it since they frequent Reddit. 

JNMIL messaged DH in our group chat (we've been low contact for a year since they were jerks when they moved out of town suddenly, after years of them bitching we didn't live close enough) asking what our  DDs birthday plan is. As of last year DD has said she wants kids parties now, adults are lame. It's cool, we respect that and tell family, no family parties from now on and all is well. Or so it would seem, in actuality, JNMIL and JNFIL were so consumed with their move they couldn't make time for us despite us asking and trying. 

So, things have been low contact since then, it was the straw that broke the camel's back, after years of them being assholes we had enough. 

Anyway. So JNMILs message was asking what the plan was and then followed it up with ""we missed everything last year......."". Which pissed me off because they know why they missed out and what purpose did it serve to say it. I am suspicious and respond despite the message being directed only at DH. 

I say, ""DD wants kids parties from now on, just like last year, since the end of school and her birthday are so close together we haven't confirmed anything yet"". Then I also said, ""I'm going to be blunt, you know why you missed everything and honestly I am not sure why you brought it up"". 

JNMIL flipped her shit! DH backed me up and JNMIL went off saying she has to walk on egg shells and hates all the rules. Then said they won't be visiting then. 

I am laughing. We don't set boundaries any different for them then we do anyone else it's ridiculous that she's upset about it. 

After breaking it down for DH that she doesn't like following the rules and that she's upset by that. We agreed to hold our ground and she can enjoy her self imposed exile. 

JNFIL left the chat right before that happened. DH is hurt and angry. I was at first because it brought up a ton of feelings from when I had given birth to DD and JNMIL pulled this shit then too. 

I'm not even sure what advice I could use right now. I am just frustrated by it all.",JUSTNOMIL
"As I write, my DH is on his way to a mandatory family function in a tux. I am sitting in my local chippy waiting for a fish supper wearing crappy clothes. This is a win, folks! 


My MIL declared some months ago that we were all to attend a gala dinner on 31st May. I worried about it for a week - I did not want to attend (not one of the family will talk to me because I don't put up with their bullpoop).


After a week I had the following conversation with DH.

Me: Um, I don't want to go.

DH: Oh I don't want to go either. I have to but you're free to stay home.

Me: Woohoo!

A later conversation with MIL.


MIL: I just want to have all my family around me at the gala dinner. We just never know how much longer I'll be alive. And you know that family is so important. 
Me: I'm not attending. 

MIL: *sputters endlessly* But I want... 

Me: You'll have a great time. Oh, I was just thinking about our holiday to [holiday destination] a few years ago... We had such fun that time when we... Oh wait, I think that was the year you didn't join us. Such a shame. We had such good, solid family time.

MIL: *CBF*


(She texted the night before the holiday to say she ""couldn't be bothered to come"" . :|)

"This is a cross post from AITA. Someone there suggested that I post here for more advice. Thanks everyone!

I have been married for 25 years. We have a son (19) and daughter (17). When our children were born we lived three blocks from my MIL. She’s an extremely self absorbed person. She has never had any interest in my husband (her son) or my children ( her grandchildren).

When my daughter was born, I asked her to keep my son while I was in the hospital giving birth. She let him stay at her house, but she hired a baby sitter to take care of him. That’s the only time my son has ever stayed with her in his entire life. My daughter has never stayed with her, not once. When my daughter was only two weeks old, my husband got shingles. The doctor said it was dangerous for a newborn to be exposed to shingles. I had to pack up the two year old and newborn and leave our home and leave my sick husband by himself. I went to MILs house, explained the situation, and asked for her help. She refused to help us. After my husband got better, she laughed at me and rubbed my nose in the fact that I asked for help and didn’t get it. We told her how hurt we were by the way she treated us, but she refused to acknowledge our feelings and refused to apologize. Needless to say, I never asked for her help again.

She moved out of our area a couple of years later, which was a relief for me. Since then, she has completely ignored us other than Christmas cards for the kids with a check inside and late birthday cards for the kids. That’s how it’s been for the last 15 years.

Well, she recently moved back to our area. She didn’t even tell us she was moving. My husband got a text from his sister telling him when and where to be to help with moving day. That was the only communication.

Out of the blue, MIL started showing up at my daughter's school events, uninvited. You have to realize, she’s basically a stranger to my daughter. My daughter is shy and introverted. She’s the kind of person that you have to win her trust. It creeped my daughter out when MIL started showing up at her events. It made her nervous and self conscious. I didn’t think it was fair for her to just show up after all this time and make my daughter uncomfortable.

So........I explained to MIL that my children had never in their life had a support system other than me and DH. I told her that she was making my daughter uncomfortable and that she shouldn’t just show up at events without an invitation. Part of me feels really guilty for doing this and part of me feels good about standing my ground. What do you think? Am I the justno? What should I do next?

Thank you so much for the gold award!! I never expected this much attention or support. Your validation is extremely healing for me. I appreciate it more than you will ever know!!",JUSTNOMIL
"So it came to my attention that my in laws get super pissed that I call my son by his middle name. A little background, my husband and I picked our boys name long before he was a thought. It was also a time when my husband was not getting along with his family. When we found out I was having a boy, I was excited we already had a name and that we still wanted to use it. Now my husband's family is Italian and they have a tradition of naming the first born males first born Male by the grandfather's name. They have a whole bunch of ""rules"" that confuse me but these rules made my husband a 3rd. And would make my son a 4th. I was not having that. But my husband told me it was actually important to him so we settled on giving my son 2 middle names, because they were important to me. Compromise, yay! Its important to note that my husband also calls him by his middle name. So hes not offended in the slightest that I do this.

Well my sister in law informed me shortly after he was born that my calling MY son by his middle name was a problem for their family. I got angry because hes my son, fuck you. I dont care what they call him. I made that very clear. Call him whatever you want as long as it's out of love. But I'm non confrontational and I like my inlaws for the most part. So I started calling him ""my baby"" or ""your grandson"" or ""beans"" which is a little nickname that cant possibly piss them off. Not that they ever said anything to me, but I did confirm it with my other sister in law. It's the talking shit behind my back that drove me nuts. 

Today, I decided to say fuck it. I dont care about their feelings. Hes my son. And I used his middle name in a text to her. It's a small thing. But it felt good.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi everyone. I've lurked for a long time but never posted. I feel like I have a lot to say, so I'm going to try and make a cohesive post. There will be a TL;DR at the end since I do expect this to get long.

So, some background information on my mom and my family. My mom is Italian, and had all the typical personality of an Italian (talks a lot, overshares, touchy-feely, talks with her hands, etc). She also has some other fun personality traits; like making things about herself, rug sweeping EVERYTHING, gaslighting, guilt tripping more often than I physically trip over nothing (which is a lot, stupid weak ankles...).... Basically, my mom is a lot.
She's also the kind of mom with little to no sense of boundaries, no matter how much I spell them out. Keep in mind that I'm a 26yo female with a disability, so I've been living at home until I could figure out a better situation. She will just walk into my room, at 7am, WITHOUT knocking... Even though I've asked her not to so many freaking times.
My mom is also in school full time to become an LPN, and she's the main breadwinner of the house. Because of this, before she started school she renovated our basement (with the help of her many jamaican guy friends who come to Canada for the summer to work in the orchards... This will be relevant later)and made it into a basement suite, which she rents out. The income from the suite is enough to cover rent, and the renters portion of utilities. Mom works part time for the rest.

So, the reason I've finally decided to post here is because of a situation that I think I might need some advice on. Actually, several situations I feel like I need some advice and feedback on.
So as I mentioned, I'm 26 and live in a house that has no boundaries or privacy. I never feel comfortable inviting people over, friends or otherwise, because there's absolutely no soundproofing and my mom often hijacks conversations. Our house upstairs is also under constant renovation, with at least 5 half finished projects at any time, and it's rarely clean. (I'm a pet sitter and I'm only home maybe half the month, depending how busy I am, which makes it hard for me to help with upkeep. We also have 5 cats and a large dog, all on one floor of a house)

Our current tenant is moving out, and my little sister (21) and I saw a golden opportunity to create a little distance and privacy between our mom and us. We've been looking at pet friendly rentals for a while, and none of them have been a perfect fit. The basement still isn't perfect, but it's much better than most of the options we've looked at. About 3 weeks ago we talked to mom, and asked if we could take the basement rental over with my girlfriend so that we could afford it. She said yes, gave us a slightly reduced price, and told us we didn't need a down deposit.
We rejoiced, and started spending money on stuff we were going to need, while also setting aside our portions of rent.

Because of my disability being unpredictable, and having recently gone through bankruptcy, I tend to hoard money. I have a little cash box where i keep my pet sitting funds, and I also like to keep at least a grand in my bank account at all times, just in case of an emergency. I had saved just over a grand in my cash box so I could finally afford to buy a nice, grown up bed frame. I was so excited to finally get off of my futon frame and into something that would work really well I nthe small room I was moving into.

5 days before moving day, mom comes up to me and tells me she fucked up. She had taken a down deposit from the downstairs tenant, and instead of setting it aside like she was supposed to, she fucking spent it. 
That deposit was an entire months rent, because she had dogs. Or at least, she THINKS that's what it was - she doesn't remember, and can't find the rental agreement. 🤬
And since she wasn't getting a deposit from us, and rent needed to go towards bills, she now needed a deposit from me.
Her disabled, bankrupt daughter.
And this isn't the first time she's asked me for money. It also won't be the last - she already,asked if she can ""borrow"" $2000 and invest it in a vehicle she wants to fix up and sell. Oh don't worry - I'd TOTALLY get it back, plus $100! It's JUST like investing money in a bank. /s 🙄

Something to keep in mind - when you go bankrupt, at least here in Canada, the bankruptcy term lasts about 9 months. During those 9 months, you need to make a monthly payment to atone for the bankruptcy. It's usually a much, much smaller amount than what you've gone bankrupt on. In my case, it was $200/month. My bankruptcy was recent enough that I'm still paying, but only have 2 payments left. They asked me if I could provide both this month, at the beginning of the month, so they could start exiting me from bankruptcy and transition me into the ""recovery"" period, where you try to build your credit back up while waiting for the bankruptcy to come off of your credit report. (About 7 years)

So, between mom asking for an entire months rent, my portion of rent, and bankruptcy asking for $400, I was looking at around $2000 at the beginning of this month.

In moments like these, I'm so glad I hoard money.

Right now, I'm just so angry. She risked our safety by not putting aside that money. If I hadn't had money to give her for the down deposit, what would we have fucking done? My sister and gf didn't have money, not after buying house stuff that we needed. Not 5 days before moving day. She could have fucked up badly enough that she had to fault on the mortgage payment, and then never mind that much needed privacy - we might not have had a home at all.

And this isn't the only time recently she's risked our safety and security in our home. Remember those Jamaicans I mentioned? Well, she married one of them back in September, after knowing him in person for just a few months. She essentially married a stranger and let him live in our home.
And recently, I found out that she doesn't even love him! She married him to make somebody jealous. And that somebody is a man who she has been having an affair with. He married his girlfriend instead of breaking up with her to be with my mom, so my mom married a much younger man with poor English skills to make him jealous and to hurt him.

This dude can't even work most jobs, because he can't read English. Which means he can't help with the mortgage or the bills.
Oh, and mom also told me recently that he doesn't understand that ""no means no"", because that's not how it works in Jamaica.

Let that sink in for a minute, and understand what that really means.

One last thing. The basement rental also includes paying for our share of utilities, so yesterday I finally caught my mom for a minute and asked her how much our share was going to cost for 3/5ths of the bill.
She stood in that kitchen and made up a number without looking at anything.
""Ohh, probably... idk, $300? No, $400? We can call it $375, how about that?""

Like, fucking hell. If that's really 3/5ths of the bill I'm happy to pay it, but you can't just make up a number and expect us to be okay with that. And when I told her as much today, she basically made me feel like the biggest jerk alive for questioning her.

Ugh.

Tl;dr, There are so many more stories around my mom, but this is where we're standing right now. About to move into her basement, made up utility payments, asking for huge amounts of money from her disabled daughter who already has bills of her own - including her portion of rent, marrying strangers to make other people jealous, and never taking our safety seriously.

Does anyone have any advice going forward? How do we stay safe and secure in this rental agreement? What should we put in the rental agreement? (We haven't even signed anything yet!) Shoukd we start immediately looking at other places, and not even get settled here? We plan on painting today and moving some stuff in tomorrow, but I'm panicking a bit now.",JUSTNOMIL
"Update: Thank you everyone for your kind comments and suggestions. I'll try them out and provide updates as needed. I will most likely also provide a full history/background post eventually. Thank you again! 

Providing Background so that responses can choose to be more tailored: Muslim South Asian myself, Muslim South Asian in laws but different country, so language barriers exist and we speak in English. I speak fluent English and they speak broken English but not completely understandable. They interrupt a lot, almost in the middle of sentence, which also irritates me to no end.  

They are always commenting one thing or another, rarely anything positive. ""NO"" is not an answer because when I say no, the response is why? In regards to kids, we want them but not yet, we want to be more financially stable and in a better home as our current place is small and we live separate from them. We bought our place with our own money, no help with either set of parents at a very young age. Instead of commending us, the first comment was from my FIL ""oh it's so small, where will we stay if we come over?"" They live only 20 minutes away and I would never have them stay over at our current house. 

Most of the time, my MIL is a YMIL. Last night, I was at the in-laws and I was looking at a few wedding photos.  She's like you were skinny then? I was a bit dumbfounded but I guess I showed my disgust in my face and she's like no maybe the same and she retracted. I closed up my phone to indicate the conversation was done. 

My husband saw this and said, I think you look great now or then. I said thank you. 

Yes I've gained weight, almost 15 pounds since 2.5 years ago. I didn't know what to say or how to respond. There was no remorse or anything, it was so rude, I felt extremely hurt and cried on the way home. 

A few months back, we found out an aunt is having a second kid, a girl. She already has a boy, so when we found out through MIL, I said that's great, it's a complete family. She then said I wonder what they'll name her? She asked me if ""Aisha"" was nice, I said no I don't like that name. She followed up with why? I just said I don't like it. She then said maybe you will have a girl soon. I didn't respond. My husband told her to calm down. 

Last month, I saw this pregnant aunt and discreetly said congrats as she's not showing yet but was about 5 months pregnant. My MIL came into the conversation and said maybe you and aunt can celebrate your baby shower together!!!! I said no and laughed and walked away. In my head, Wtf? I'm not pregnant and even if I was, I would NOT celebrate it with another person, let alone have you plan any aspect of it (terrible memories of wedding planning - maybe will do another post). Two weeks later, same thing and she said maybe you're going to have a girl and I said ""when God wills it, yes""

I just don't know what to say when these comments happen, I feel like as a South Asian, there's a layer of respect for your in-laws but even if I were to ""snap"", they wouldn't understand it. My husband says to tune them out as they're always like this - a scratch record repeating the same stuff over and over again. 

I have gotten a little better since getting married but I could essentially write any essay or a dissertation on this. The amount of stuff they have said and done is mind blowing but I respect my husband and thus, I try and respect his parents. 

Where are their manners? You do not comment on someone's weight and you do not ask them if/when they're pregnant unless they share it with you directly. I'm worried for the future as they are just inching towards JN. 

Please, when you comment, if you are of South Asian background, I would appreciate recommendations how to navigate this. If you're not of South Asian backgrounds, you're welcome to comment as well. I look forward to all suggestions.",JUSTNOMIL
"A few days ago my MIL and me, we had an argument. An insignificant one, I would say. She visited us and we had a disagreement about the interior of the house of my wife and me. We both fans of minimalism, our house has little furniture. For example, in our living room, there are a sofa, a coffee table, a TV, two floor lamps and that’s it. Plenty of space and easy to clean. Not because we wouldn’t have the money to buy more stuff, but because we don’t need it. If I don’t need a rug there I won’t buy it just so that the floor wouldn’t be bare.

MIL didn’t like it, because she’s one of those people who clutter every table and every shelf with souvenirs, decorative figures and things they don’t actually need. In her house, it’s almost impossible to move around without knocking something over. She commented that our house looks more like an office and that it’s impossible to feel at home here. She complained that everything is so empty, the house looks abandoned and we’re living like bums.

So I told her, very politely, that she can do whatever she wants in her house but this is our house and this is how we like it and her comments are inappropriate. What our house looks like is none of her business. Even though I didn’t say anything rude, it obviously offended her.

Yesterday my wife had a name day. I don’t know if you celebrate those in the USA but in Europe we do. She visited MIL without me because I had to work and MIL gave her a cake that she brought home and when I came home in the evening, we both ate it. 

I’m very allergic to strawberries. I don’t have any life-threatening reactions but it's still very unpleasant. After a while, I started to experience the symptoms of strawberry allergy and I immediately thought it was the cake because it was the only thing I had eaten after getting home from work.

From the looks of it, it didn’t look like it had strawberries in it. It was a chocolate cake with some glazing on top of it. While eating what I tasted was mostly chocolate but then we looked closer at it and saw a little bit of filling that was strawberries. I guess it’s because the cake itself was so dark brown and the filling was very little, I didn’t notice it immediately but when I did it was too late. I just need a little piece of strawberry to cause the allergy.

It happened yesterday’s evening and today I look like a strawberry myself. I have a rash all over my body, I have hives, I’m itchy. I had to call in sick to work because I cannot go to work looking like that. I'm going to be ok soon but it still feels bad. My wife called MIL and asked her why did she put strawberries in the cake when she knew I’m allergic. She knew it. 

MIL was like ”Oh sorry, I forgot about that, I didn’t even think about his allergy. I cannot keep everyone’s health problems in mind, you know. Maybe it’s something else, not strawberries. And he wasn’t even supposed to eat it, it was a cake for you.”

How can you forget about it? How? She knew very well I’m allergic, we talk about this every summer when she says how pity is it that I cannot eat the delicious strawberries from her garden. It cannot be anything else. I know myself, I know my body, I’m allergic to nothing else but strawberries. I have had this allergy since I was a child. And did she really think that my wife would eat the cake all by herself? Of course, she’s going to give me a piece as well. 

My wife said that MIL is apologizing and that maybe she actually forgot it and didn’t mean to harm me. I don’t know but honestly, I don’t buy it. I don’t believe it. I might be overreacting but I feel like MIL was trying to get back at me because of what I said to her about the interior of our house. Because why would you put the allergen of someone into the food that they’re going to be eating unless you want to harm them?",JUSTNOMIL
"So lovely people my significant other \[23M\] and I \[22F\] have had to move back in with my mom and dad, so I've been lurking here to feel better.... But now I need some mild advice.

&amp;#x200B;

Both my mother and my father has had their JN moments, but I never thought it was this bad until I moved back in from living on my own for almost 6 years. I can't even lay out meat for dinner without one of them butting in and taking over the task for me. It's like I am the child again, which is insanely frustrating. 

&amp;#x200B;

For some background:

My mother (JNM) is an alcoholic, she cheated on my father soon after I left the house 5 years ago, she's a heavy smoker of cigarettes and weed when she has it, she's a clean freak to a degree (things have to be clean, but *her way....* I have always thought she had OCD, but she refuses to go to the doctor).

My father (JND) is unemployed, in school, very emotional still from finding out mom cheated on him, kind of explosive with frustration, and has started drinking more since mom cheated.

&amp;#x200B;

So we were drowning in rent, monthly bills, student loans so we thought moving in with my parents could help a lot financially. My JYSO was in the military so when I asked if he could deal with my parents antics, he agreed. I gave him a fair warning, told him multiple stories, just so my parents behavior wasn't a complete shocker to him.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, my mom and I rode out to a clothing store because we had a mishap with a credit card I applied for came to my mailbox, but in her name. Before we even get in the car to go there I explain from my brief stint in retail that the managers at the store can't do anything about the credit cards, we have to talk to be the company that issued the card. But hey, according to her I don't know anything, the ""manager will know what to do"".  So in the car with JNM and JND took the time to have a ""discussion"" with me on when we were going to start helping to pay the bills because they're so broke with JND not working and just surviving on JNM's paycheck. I pointed out to her that 3 days earlier I had gotten off work at 6:30pm came home and talked to her about when and how much do we need to start paying, she said that ""I'm drinking right now, we'll talk later"". JNM then said that I can know better than to try to talk to her about that kind of stuff when she's drinking, but that it's not just money that I need to help out around the house more, I know how to pick up a vacuum, and I need to clean my cats litter box every day, if not twice a day. My SO and I have been cleaning the box every other day with no problems for a year now, I explain. She goes on to say ""YOU don't have to smell the cat litter all the time, I DO because you put it in the living room that you don't even use"". Y'all this litter box is NOT in the living room, it's in the guest bathroom that we use as our bathroom, it's connected to the living room. Basically, she corners me in the car with all this bullshit, I just ignore it and shut down because I know if I replied, she would start yelling and trying to use her authority over me as my mother and that would have seriously made me start packing my stuff and calling apartments. I am texting SO as both JNM and JND start telling me I'm irresponsible and immature, and he's starting to get frustrated because he knows she's doing this away from him so that she can bully me. During the car ride from hell JNM had to stop by the grocery store and the beer store, and definitely didn't tell me we were going there. At both the grocery store and the beer store she tried getting me to buy alcohol. I refused because she had just nagged at me in the car about how I need to save money and don't spend it on ""stupid shit"". I told her in the grocery store ""you know how I save money? Look, \*walks away from beer isle\* I just saved $12."" Later once we got home, SO and I end up sitting on the back deck with them. JND makes a snarky comment about how he thought we were moving in to get rid of credit card debt, not to apply for more. So, naturally being snarky right back, I said ""I thought you guys were broke but you're always have money for cigarettes and beer"". It ended up in mom trying to flex her authority with me and me reminding her I am not 15 anymore, I lived on my own for 6 years, and she doesn't scare me. I walked in the house, went to my tv room, closed the door because I don't want to argue. Eventually it got late enough that I wanted to go to my bedroom, I open my door, and guess what this bitch did?

&amp;#x200B;

She put the cat litter box in my room right as you walk in the (tiny) room.

"Just to set the tone, I actually quite love my mother in law. She's very old and frail and always has the best intentions. However, she's very quick to make rash decisions and is senile. 

For a few months now, my DH and I have been talking about building her a MIL suite on our property. Just a small studio so that she can live with us without living WITH us. We've got everything in the works, but we're about a year out from having anything actually ready. We've spoken with her about it very little, but she knows it's in the works for sometime next year. 

Now, the only reason she can't live WITH us is because she's severely allergic to dogs and cats. We have five acres of land. I breed dogs, and currently have eight of them.  Plus I have three cats that come indoors and out as they please. They're mousers because we live in the country. 

This morning at 630am my MIL calls my DH to say she's booked a ticket and she'll be here Tuesday night. And she's going to be staying with us for a month. Yay! 

I don't have anywhere for her to stay away from the animals at this time so now I've got four days to move all of my animals downstairs to our completed basement and scrub every inch of my upstairs to remove any remnants of animal fur or dander. And then, I have to figure out how to block the cats from coming up from the basement because they have access up and down through the beams in my upstairs bathroom.  Not to mention, I'm by no means financially prepared for another person because I just quit my job a week ago to focus more on my kennel business so my husband is the only one bringing in money. The two bedrooms upstairs are for my son and my daughter who are seven and eight years old. So I dont even have an extra room for her. 

I love the woman. I do. But right now I wanna scream. I can't tell her not to come as she's on a very fixed income from SSI and she's just spent hundreds of dollars on nonrefundable tickets and therefore will probably literally die of starvation if I don't let her come. And it makes me think that she likely is struggling desperately back home but hasn't told us. I'm feeling so frustrated and overwhelmed right now that she didn't even give us a heads up, but trying so hard to be a supportive wife and DIL. My husband is elated to spend so much time with his mom in the coming months. But I'm being an asshole and I can only feel frustrated and upset. 😭😭😭",JUSTNOMIL
"I’m the fool here. I’m so mad at myself for ever giving her a second chance. Long story coming. 

In this case, “MIL” is my mom. She’s also a narcissist. Her true colors came out when I met my fiancé. He was from a much lower income family than ours, and to my mom (who swears she doesn’t care about social status and appearance), that was already the first strike against him. My fiancé is amazing; he’s the most gentle hearted, loving, patient man I’ve ever known. He challenges me, and encourages me, and never gives up on me. I was a virgin when we started dating and I don’t know how I know, and believe me I’ve gotten loads of criticism over it already, but I decided he was the one I wanted to give my virginity to. Well, NMom found out and lost it. Long story short, she made my life hell. Destroyed my belongings, threatened me, wished I’d never been born, told me I might as well have killed her. I “betrayed” her. I lost over 20 pounds in a month. I cried ALL the time. Home became so toxic, that even though I couldn’t afford it, I moved out. My fiancé (boyfriend at the time) helped me make ends meet just so I wouldn’t have to go back. After almost a year, we both started to rise in life, and my mom came crawling back, apologizing and wanting to make amends. After a lot of debating and a lot of struggle, we decided to forgive her. Shortly after, (at the time) boyfriend proposed. We wanted a small wedding, only what we could afford, about $15,000. When my mom found out, she legitimately said “No! If you think I’m going to let my daughter have a cheap wedding, you’re wrong. Don’t worry, your father and I will pay the remainder.” Because I’m an absolute stupid moron, I believed her.

Things had honestly been great since then. Fiancé and I moved in with my parents at one point that our apartment became infested. Then moved out when I got another job. It was during this time that it was revealed to me that the whole time we were paying $1,000 in rent for a 350sq ft room, under the understanding that my brother and his girlfriend were paying the same, it was actually only us. My brother and his girlfriend hadn’t been paying rent in over 6 months, and when they had, their rent was only $300. BIG warning. My stupid self with wedding brain missed it.

Now here we are, 28 days away from my wedding day. Final invoices are coming in left and right. My parents have about $9,000 left to pay. And my mom calls me last night to say “We agreed to help you because you seemed to need it. But now it seems like you don’t need our help anymore, so we won’t be helping you pay the rest. You and Fiancé seem to make enough to figure it out!” When I started to get shocked and angry, she got angry in return, and demanded that I stop getting emotional. After all, I’m the bride. I need to stop getting stressed out. This $9,000 is going to destroy us. It’s going to take maxing out our credit cards, which will tank our credit. We’ll blow through our savings. Things were starting to look up for us; we were going to pay off ALL of our debt in December. I was going to be able to finally have enough to go back to school and get my nursing degree. We were going to be able to build up more savings to buy a house. Now all of this is taking that away. I should have known better. I shouldn’t have believed her or trusted her. I just sit here and think, what am I going to do?

TL;DR: Mom wanted a fancier wedding for fiancé and I. Said she’d pay the remaining $9,000 that she wanted. 28 days before the wedding, she changes her mind and leaves us with the bills.

UPDATE: Turns out my dad having an unexpected surgery next week, and doesn’t have any paid time off from work to cover it. He also hasn’t been able to go to work in over a week/closer to two, so as a one income household they’re losing money. While they’re not able to pitch in the $9,000 they originally agreed to, they will still help where they can. That being said, I am still frustrated. Fiancé and I still want this wedding. Think of us what you will, but this is our wedding. We wanted a $15,000 wedding and that’s how much we’ve invested into it. I’ve planned this whole thing on my own for the last year and a half. My mom wanted more and promised more, but can’t pay up. So we’re downsizing a LOT. No more wedding favors. No crazy open bar. No fancy frills. I talked to our vendors like so many of you suggested (thank you SO MUCH) and they were so understanding and willing to help us work things out to drastically bring $9,000 to something MUCH more manageable. We can still have our wedding and not cripple our future. I do want to add that despite all of this, I have definitely learned my lesson with mom...thank you everyone for all of your advice and kind words for a bride/girl in need.",JUSTNOMIL
"    Ive posted here once before, but im definitely not a seasoned Reddit user. I just had to rant a little, as Im currently pretending to nap upstairs hiding from MIL. 
    To preface a lot of this, MIL is 4'9 and like 100 pounds MAX. very tiny woman, can wear kids clothes. I , however, am like 5'5 and 215 pounds. Im not small in the slighest, being honest with myself, Im fat. 
     WELL, MIL insists on watching things like ""my 600 lb life"" on marathon, and constantly making comments about fat people and how she doesnt get it. She works at a nursing home, she has mentioned how fat a couple of her tennants are so far, mentioning that she doesnt know if maybe people have nothing  better to do than eat.
      I absolutely despise the woman in this moment. I hate how she feels so superior to others, even though all she does is go home after work and clean her house alone while she drinks herself to sleep. 
      I can tell shes jealous of  SO and I, and i dont trust her. I mentioned this in the first post i made, but her husband #5 or something passed away a few years back, she hadnt lived with my SO since he was 12, hardly saw him, but while her late husband was passing, she called my SO to move in and help take care of him (he had serosis of the liver). Ever since, she acts like she's never taken care of herself. I have no problem with him having a relationship with his mother, but shes very selfish and manipulative. SO is the type that takes people at face value, and doesnt see the nuanced attempts to reel in pity. 
     Im about to go back down to re enter the emotional massacre. Sorry for the rant, im feeling very much so on an island right now.",JUSTNOMIL

"My now mother in law and I have had some difficulties. A little back story I have a four month old and her son and I just got married a couple of weeks ago. He’s a great guy, but his family can be difficult.

We got engaged a week before I found out I was pregnant. His brother got engaged six months after us and his family constantly talks about them getting married and never mentioned us getting married at all.They have a family chat where his family for the longest a time  commented more on their cats and fish than their own grandson. We invited his parents to the wedding and the date didn’t work for his mom and he said she sounded annoyed when we invited her. We decided to elope anyhow.

Prior to this, when my son was born his family was extremely upset that I wanted visitors the next day. I was scheduled to be induced two weeks early and was terrified of childbirth. I caved and let them come to the hospital and visit that day anyhow. While I was in labor I had to hear from my own mother how MIL is upset in the waiting room. 

Part of my birth plan I had written and gotten the okay from my husband entailed us bonding with our son immediately after birth. His parents made a huge deal how he had to come out to the waiting room immediately after even though they knew my birth plan and that’s what I wanted. Two days later she unsubscribes from a shared baby photo album of our son. Later invited her again she rejoined. When she did visit him hours after he was born she didn’t even want to hold him. I’m always very polite even when things like that happen. 

So since our wedding date didn’t work for her we decided to elope. When she found out I was pregnant she insisted my husband tell his family on their family chat. So we decided to tell everyone at once through our shared album instead with around 8 family members who we would have had to message individually if we didn’t do that. It’s a Baby Album, but we wanted to show his parents got married. We traveled and planned a wedding all by ourselves with a baby which was stressful enough so we figured that was the way to tell them. His sister seemed upset at first that she wasn’t invited and his mom commented that she was uncomfortable with the announcement, but hey congratulations. Later they liked a couple wedding pictures, have babysat, and been nice in person. But it’s still very stressful for me to be around his family. We did send out a formal announcement recently to all extended family as well. 

Holidays are very tough with this fam too. On thanksgiving his brother and fiancé were upset that my FIL said nice things about us at dinner. He toasted everybody but was excited for baby coming. FIL is the nicest guy and has never been a problem. His brother and fiancé however on Easter shot darts (they’re in their 30s) at our infant son as if they were purposely trying to upset him. When his brother and fiancé see our son they look like they’re going to be sick and are rude to us. On my first Mother’s Day I didn’t even feel like I could celebrate for myself because of his mom and not wanting to upset her or there be more drama. I’m already nervous for thanksgiving and Christmas.

It’s been a lot this year. I had a high risk pregnancy, early delivery, my son has colic, and I didn’t get a solid night of sleep for three months. 

There was more drama a long the way. My husband is such a great guy but doesn’t seem to think anything of this behavior (other than the dart incident) which concerns me since my son and I are his family. Am I being overly sensitive? This is really tough for me some really important days of my life are now filled with memories of them not being supportive. It’s also really tough because husband wants us to hang out with them and he’s wants them to babysit a lot",JUSTNOMIL

"I’ve been less and less affected by my Nmom’s emails over the years, but I’m still pretty annoyed and a bit shaken by her latest attempt to hook me back. Some honest support would be nice, thanks.

For more context, I recommend a cursory glance at my post history.

&gt; Dear DontThrowYouAway,

&gt; For almost three years, you haven’t come back home or called us. Think about every day during twenty two years, how much love and support we devoted on you. There is no reason for you to distance yourself from us.

No reason except the regular verbal abuse, threats to take away my tuition, shelter, and life, and the physical violence (beatings, chasing me around the house with any object you can find, forcing me to lie down and let you take out your anger on me until you’re satisfied) you forced onto me when I did a trivial thing like not do my homework. Yep, absolutely no reason at all.

&gt; I have told you that whatever you did wrong or bad, we are still your parents who are willing to continue to support you. For the past three years, you have been hurting your parents for knowing nothing about you. 

So in order to “support” me, you resort to blaming me for not attending to your perceived need to feed off my presence and obedience? God damn, someone give this woman a medal!

&gt; From the statements I received from [place I’ve never heard of], I know you have been visiting a Psychiatrist every month with [x] minutes of PsychoTherapy. If you need extra help please let me know. I hope you can let your doctor talk with me to help you on your treatment you needed.

Uh? You have no business prying into my life. I will be contacting whatever place gave you that information and getting them to shut their mouth about me. I’m pretty sure that’s a HIPAA violation.

&gt; I don't understand why you hide your problems from us. We are the ones you should fully trust and can give you help on everything. It is so wrong the approach you have been taking. It hurts us so badly to know you have a problem but refuse our help and blame us. 

 Have you ever considered the off chance that, I don’t know... YOU ARE THE PROBLEM? Every time I tell you my problems, you either dismiss it or use it as an excuse to exert more control on me and make me feel more helpless. But nah, that’s just what every loving mother is supposed to do, right? My bad.

Do you go to a venomous snake for help after it bites and poisons you? No. Then why do you think I’d be that stupid?

&gt; One thing I want to remind you: tell the truth of your problems to your Psychiatrist, that is the only way to solve your problem. What I mean here is: gaming and virtual world wandering made you have poor performance in your college years and made us suffer and damaged our health. 

“Me? Do anything wrong? NAHHHHH. It’s uhhh... all those games you were playing! All my verbal assaults and threats were just to *support you*! Because that’s totally how support works!”

Now, I know you’ll bury your head in your ass before you even consider this next point, but... what if the reason I depended on video games, social media, and drawing art was that I a) felt incompetent and overwhelmed by the sudden workload increase and didn’t want you to make it worse by blaming and putting excessive pressure on me, and b) once you found out, you (predictably) turned my life into a living nightmare and my dorm room into essentially a prison cell? If you wanted me to grow up into a healthy, independent adult, why did you raise me to be dependent on others, specifically you?

Honestly, your lack of introspection and respect for basic human decency is astounding. Kindly fuck off with your gaslighting, please and thank you.

&gt; So many young adults have mental health problem from there. You are one of them. The truth is truth. We don't blame you any more. 

You “don’t blame me”, but yet again, your entire email is a blame-fest, blaming me for cutting contact with you in order to preserve my sanity. In fact, your entire email is a big surprised Pikachu face, wondering why it hurts after you shot yourself in the foot. Make up your mind, will ya?

&gt; We just want to help you to stand up again. We can help you to find your ground and confidence and create a good routine daily life. You still have a beautiful life in front of you. With our support, you could make your dream come true: being a doctor or a scientist. Is it still your dreaming life?

Isn’t it amazing that I only managed to rise from depression and fear after I cut contact with you? Isn’t it *just fascinating* that after three years of NC with you and your toxicity, I have established a healthy relationship, daily routine, and productive and purposeful career in science? I FUCKING WONDER WHY.

&gt; I wish you would make a plan to come back home. Nothing should stop you coming back home. A true friend of yours would encourage you go back home to get more relaxed, more support and power to face different types of challenges in your life because of parent's love is selfless and priceless.

My common sense is what’s stopping me from going back to you. Who would want to go back to someone who has done nothing but blame, guilt, and make false promises since they left? Your emails have, and continue to reek of disingenuousness. Are you a mother, or a pyramid scheme peddler?

Also, I would not consider someone so pushy and out of touch with reality to be a “true friend”. Just throw the whole “friend” away at that point.

&gt; I have planted a lot of fruit trees and vegetables in our small backyard. Like I said, here is always your home. Parent's home is your home and nothing changed. 

“LALALALALA I’M GONNA PRETEND THINGS ARE STILL THE WAY IT USED TO BE!”

Ding ding ding! Codependency alert!

&gt; Please come back home. Write to me and call me. Let me book tickets for you. We miss you so much. 

&gt; Love, Mom

"Update: Because a lot of you are worried about how my Fdh was a JustNoSo until recently, I made a post about it. Hopefully this let's you see he is getting better, or maybe let me see if I have a cognitive dissonance issue.
 https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNoSO/comments/bvlicc/my_health_was_not_a_priority_to_my_fdh/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

I posted about two weeks ago about my Fmil whom never invites me to ""family"" events. I just recovered from bronchitis and now dealing with some nausea and dehydration so thought I might post while I wait for my stomach to settle.

First, having this place to talk about my Fmil is wonderful and thank you to the people that give advice and support. I'm still hesitant to call her a JustNo when comparing her to other stories, but she still has those JustNo moments that are disappointing.

After my first post, some comments made me realize Fmil was an introvert. While I never thought she acted out of maliciousness this new idea changed how I viewed the situation a lot. 

She has gone back to ignoring me (and her own BF) when planing ""family"" stuff with just my fiancé and his brother. It sucks, but hopefully Fdh will start telling her ""his family"" includes me. 

Move out date is approaching, and our current residence (Fmil is our landlady) finally got the mold remediation I needed years ago. She also will pay for a cleaning service because Fbil is a slob. This apparently has nothing to do with my asthma and frequent respiratory infections, but her golden child, my Fbil/roommate, is getting a new roommate with medical issues. 

I'm happy she finally is treating the issue but the fact she didn't do this when I needed it feels like a total JustNo thing. I realize Fdh should have pushed it more but...

My medical issues have been a huge problem in my relationship with Fdh, and it IS Fmil's fault and a total JustNo situation. She is a former registered nurse that convinced her sons that the flu shot is a big pharma's money grab. 

A few years ago my bloodwork showed the frequent respiratory infections from being asthmatic ruined my immune system. I was diagnosed as immune deficient and advised to take yearly flu and every other year pneumonia shots, and my housemates should do so as well. I should have recovered in three years if I didn't suffer from more serious infections.

It's been five years and I've gotten extremely sick every year. The surface mold, roommate/Fbil smoking, and allergy season makes me sick for weeks, and even though I got my shots I couldn't fight what my Fdh brought home. He recovers in a day, I need weeks and multiple visits to a specialist. 

This almost broke us, and last year I moved in with my parents till I recovered and the mold was taken care of. It took a month but finally I got a call from Fdh saying I can come back, so I figured the mold was taken care of (Nope!). 

Turns out he figured the mold wasn't an issue for me after I got better, after talking to Fmil.

It wasn't till last Christmas when our friend landed in the hospital with the flu my Fdh rethought his mother's medical advice. Poor friend had to be intubated for three weeks! Fdh finally got a flu shot. 

When I came down with bronchitis in April and couldn't get better he brought up the mold remediation that was never done. The mold remediation that was my hill to die on before moving back in because I was sick, and sick of my health not being a priority to him. 

He is so lucky we were texting on the phone so I could leave that conversation till I calmed down. We talked about what I need from him and this is why he decided it was time to move out. Our new place has no sign of mold and there is no smoking roommate! Just him and me after 8 years together, finally!

I'm worried Fmil is going to be upset I separated her boys. They are both in their mid 30s but she sees Fdh as Fbil's keeper; at least she is so introverted that she wont discuss that sort of stuff. Fdh and I once tried getting Fbil kicked out for a very good reason and she threatened to sell our residence. She seems on board atm because Fbil is excited we are moving out. Not sure if I can predict what will happen here...",JUSTNOMIL
"So, I found out last week I was pregnant. Missed period, waited a week to take a test, ended up taking 2. Both were positive. 

Symptoms begin to set in, and I can't hide this at all. I decided to tell everyone and get it out of the way. D(ear)H is in agreement, we tell his family and my family. 

My SIL reacts with,""Oh yeah, Mom told us, we knew 3 months ago"". 

Hmmm. 

BIL is oblivious, is happy about the news and cracks a pretty good joke. 

On to MIL...
""Oh, I already knew. You've looked it"". She then accuses us of hiding the pregnancy for 3 months, maybe more since we've LIED to her this whole time. Says we needed to tell her first because she's the preferred grandmother (hell no, my kid will run to my mom any day, any time). She goes on to bitch about ""where are my ultrasounds, why haven't I gotten anything, you all are lying so you can build your own secret little family without me, I'm priority, blah blah blah"". Oh, and that I wasn't allowed to tell anyone else. Ha. Ha. Ha.....too late, bitch. 

I look at her and point blank tell her I had my period last month, I'm less than a month in, and that we'd only found out last week. She had such a huge CBF, thought her tea had gone sour. DH has a shiny, resplendent spine and told her she was more than welcome to be excluded as he could give a flying fuck what she thinks. I didn't think her CBF could be topped, but it was. I thought her mouth was going to get stuck in that expression. She angrily got up and walked away, slamming a door and stomping around like a child. SIL instantly apologizes, and BIL is silently sipping his tea staying the fuck out of this. 

I'm happy I'm pregnant. That bitch of an MIL is stewing in her own hate and misery. I wasn't supposed to be the mother of my first child (she had another more suitable woman picked out for DH to marry), and now she has to deal with me mothering my second child. Try to call me a mistake now, you nasty roach of a woman. 

Thanks for listening. Really need to get this out. Hang in there, people!

EDIT: Jeez, this is on a throwaway account. Thanks for all your love and support 💙 I plan on answering everyone. I'm really glad y'all could join me in how I feel about this as well as relay your own stories. We shall all stand together against the ""roast face"" AND roach face bitches!!",JUSTNOMIL
"Sooooo if you look at my earlier posts you can see that my JNMIL conveniently leaves out acknowledging my birthday, but celebrates everyone else. She just tells me it got lost in the mail. Or I don’t ask and no card ever shows up. If its a group setting (ex. Christmas) she’ll either give me a complete gag gift but act like it’s real ( a Dixie cup dispenser two years ago) or a fictional “future” trip she never gives me. 

We’re with them this weekend for a trip I planned 6 months ago (before I decided to drop the rope.- thank you guys!) 

She shows up last night with a card that she’s been “holding” for me for three months. And makes sure everyone see her give it to me. And salt. I wish I was kidding. Seasoning salt from a fancy kitchen place. I’m guessing it was around $10. 

My guess? We were all getting together and she didn’t want me to say anything to make her look like an ahole. I wouldn’t have, but ughhhhhhhh. I threw them in the trash as soon as she left. 

I hope she enjoys the trip bc it’s the last one I’ll ever plan. Since she has never planned a visit to us or a family trip in 20 years (she thinks it’s our duty to come to them and plan everything...but usually can’t bother to show up) I guess it will be a looooooooong time before we see them again. 

Her birthday is coming up. Any gift ideas? Pepper? I’ll just “hold” it for her until I see her again in x number of years.",JUSTNOMIL
"So it’s been a looooong time since I posted and my posts are probably lost to BitchBot oblivion. 

To cut a long story short my PIL’s sent a letter to my now husband that was essentially urging him to abandon me before our wedding and that a long engagement didn’t mean you actually have to get married. We attempted to
try and have a come to Jesus talk, which ended up with my MIL screaming at me she had never given me permission to call her by her first name.


Fast forward to 2 years later we are happily married and settled, I am NC and DH is VVVLC. 

MIL is approaching a milestone birthday and FIL has sent an invite for said birthday.  I’m not interested, I can barely stand looking at the photo of her miserable face on the invite. I think she’s a nasty, manipulative piece of work. I’m not a fan of FIL either as his response to his son standing up for himself was that he would write him out the will. 

I’ve said to DH it’s up to him what he decides to do but I am not going, MIL (and FIL enabling her) crossed a line 2 years ago and I won’t ever forgive them. 

Some have said this might be them trying to bury the hatchet but if she really wanted to do that then say sorry, mistakes were made. She has refused to do that insisting she had the right to do what she did before the wedding.  I should according to her just “get over it”

No. The problem with SWMBO is no one has held their ground and told her to fuck off. I am never going to ease up on this. I am not brushing this under the carpet and acting like it never happened. 

She said she didn’t want a relationship with “those people” aka my family. Congrats you have your wish,  you will never have even the vaguest relationship with me, or my children if I ever have any. You are not welcome in my home, you are not welcome in my life. You got exactly what you asked for. 

This is not the first instance of denial that has occurred, word is that they have booked a large cottage down south for a holiday as are expecting us both to join them. Ha! No! We barely talk, we don’t like each other and spending a week in isolation is never going to happen.  

Problem is with these invites is I feel I am in an awkward position with DH’s friendly extended family. 
The outlaws would probably think that is them offering me an olive branch to make amends or some shite and while ideally I would like to avoid hurting people’s feelings about their only living relative, in all honesty I am done with dealing with well meaning people trying to convince me to stand down. 

So how do I deal with this, my instinct says to be honest, and say sorry I can’t stand you, I have no interest in dealing with in-laws. I don’t care if they have a lonely old age, it’s all on them as far as I am concern. 

Maybe that is heartless, but I wish to fuck people would stop expecting me to just lay down arms and surrender.",JUSTNOMIL
"It was a good steady 4 months without having to hear her whimpering, whiny little voice. 

I was just beginning to feel okay. Now I just feel sick.

Pop is heading for a necessary (for quality of life) elective (he could survive without it, but he doesn't want to) surgery. 

Somewhere along the way, he's apparently had a heart attack that *no one* knows/knew about. 

I was told ""They've rescheduled the damn thing twice now because they're worried he won't wake up from the anesthesia.""

Followed by prying questions about my finances and multiple offers of money ""if (I) need anything."" 

Opening the spread that it's a lie, or at least the seriousness of the situation is a lie, designed to try to keep me dangling or beg for a plane ticket ""just in case"". I've never been able to trust a word that's come from her mouth. I'm not sure why something is telling me to do it now.

Realistically, if Pop knew he'd had a heart attack, he would have mentioned it when he was allowed to talk to me on the phone. (That's why I went NC; Regan wouldn't just STOP trying to take over phone calls and I just stopped answering entirely. Every time she called, I reset the timer for 2 weeks.) 

The heart attack could be a lie. 

If the heart attack is *not* a lie, the concerns about anesthetic could be true. There is no way to know without being on the information release list and calling doctors etc. myself, accepting all of Regan's calls in case there is new news and waiting for triggers, or going back to where I was raised-- taking unpaid time off from two jobs-- and putting myself right in her line of fire while she's on the hunt for as much attention as she can get from as many sources as she can get. 

But Pop's over 80. He may have a cardiac weakness in addition to his other problems.

And yet he still chose to tell me I ""misremember"" my childhood, betraying me yet again, when I'd started to think there weren't many more ways that Regan's poison could spread through my life now. Double or nothing, whatever I choose to go forward, she's going to be angry I'm not taking money when I can just work for it myself and she starts an extinction burst whether he codes on the table or not.

If this turns out to be blown out of proportion or flat out lies, maybe I won't feel so guilty about leaving Pop to the fate he's chosen. But tonight I just miss my Pop and I wish I could watch Regan choke on her own poison. I won't even feel badly for my relief that she would finally be gone. 

I don't want my pop to die. Why can't it just be her?",JUSTNOMIL
"So my mom has been talking to my brother more about my kitten (his name is Pancake Frank or just Pancakes for short) and has been really playing it up that my cat CJ “probably won’t like the kitten” when in reality, since CJ got along with my second cat Johnny just fine after a long two weeks and are now literally inseparable and so the same thing will probably happen with pancakes once I start introducing them.

What part of “I want to keep the cat” isn’t fucking coming through? I buy all of my cats food and litter more than half the time with money I get from pet sitting despite living at home, while my brother gets my mom to give him money for pet supplies even though he’s moved out, I bought all of the kitten supplies already, I bought a very nice carrier (it’s one of those backpack ones) so I can take him with me everywhere until he’s old enough to be left alone, I have been carrying him around with me everywhere I’ve been for the past 3 weeks, I literally have slept on the floor with him for the first week because he was only 4 weeks old and really skinny. 

Also something I didn’t put in my last post is that along with already having a cat, my brother has two dogs that get easily excited and one can get aggressive. Pancakes is mortified of dogs and hisses and growls and tries to lash out at them if they get too close.

I went over how irresponsible my brother can be already in my last post

WHY DO EITHER OF THESE PEOPLE THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA????

"I want to start this by saying this is really a BEC to an otherwise very nice and just yes MIL. She used to be a bar tender and a waitress most of her life while raising bottomless pit children. I think this is more a habit and her making sure she's feeding people rather than malicious intent. 

Anytime we would go to Mil house for a party or dinner she kept literally shoving food at my face. I would say no repeatedly and she just kept pushing. She means well, but she does not hear the nos. Standing in front of a group of people saying no repeatedly, no I don't want to eat more, begins to feel very childish. Also it accomplished nothing. The results were still the same. At one point I said no to rhubarb growing wild in their yard 4 or 5 times in front of everyone. She still left the house, in the dark, in a rain storm, to go get rhubarb to peel and have me eat raw in front of everyone. Yes l like vegetables, no I don't want to eat more food. (The family really likes sour foods, and puts vinegar in soups, this  was meant to show me how great sour foods are, not some weird punishment a normal person would think eating rhubarb raw is.)

I would leave her house feeling sick from the amount of food she fed us. The food courses are always numerous and massive. Always 5 apps, a full family dinner with multiple sides including bread and then usually 2 or more deserts. This is a similar problem everyone has going there. Everyone leaves feeling uncomfortably full always. Particularly her dils. Her sons just ignore her and she excepts that more easily. (Training probably.) One Dil came from a culture where you can't say no to food presented to you by your host. She was getting made physically sick. There had a to be an intervention on her behalf. 

Eventually I started to fast for the whole day before we went over there.  I still was coming out feeling sick. 

The next strategy was to fast and take very small child like portions of everything presented. Still becoming uncomfortable and frankly I was annoyed. 

 After this I started repeating her mannerisms back at her. She's a very small woman and ironically I've never really seen her eat alot of her food. So I started offering her, her own food and literally pushing it in her face like she did to us. I'd just walk up and say ""eat this, you need food."" I didn't let her say no like she did to us. I did this a few times, and what do you know she backed off me. Rinse and repeat as needed. 

I also started bringing my own homemade foods and repeatedly made her eat them. Better yet food made by my SO because she can NEVER refuse her child's homemade food. I hustled the shit out of her with that stuff.  Because she's a very health conscious lady, I always bring full fat butter, full fat cream and lard type desserts. I make sure she knows what they are too.  One or two desserts forced into her and then I'm free the rest of the night. 

I don't know if I'm being dirty, but I don't feel bad. She gets the exact same treatment she does to us. Maybe that's what she actually wants someone to do for her? I don't have to feel like I'm in a battle anymore every time I visit. She also seems happier and less all over the place with forced feeding.",JUSTNOMIL
"  So, we were NC with Miss Hannigan for a good long while. It was soo peaceful and there was a lot less stress and frustration. Husband and I discussed *maybe* contacting her to meet up in a public place one day for an hour or two, and then we didn't discuss it further. 
  
  Fast forward to a few weeks ago and here she is on my doorstep during the last hectic week of the school year with suitcases and her damn dog to stay a few days. Why? Because my darling husband, her baby boy, told her she could stay while her new man candy was out of town.  It was awful. I barely slept, I barely got any work done and fell behind on orders, she and DH cleaned out her storage unit and DUMPED HER SHIT IN MY DRIVEWAY. I wanted to run away from home. 

  She left. And left the dog. Because again my damned husband told her she could behind my back. I texted her a list of 25 kennels from $5 a day to $150 a day (I mean, her dogs are her kids, only the best for Fido, right?) And she texted DH:

  *I don't know how to explain to her that I need papers from my doctor to say he's a service animal and the vest from Amazon since we're homeless living in hotels. They can't kick him out that way. Why doesn't she just get over it?*

  Then her dumb ass copied and pasted that and sent it to me word for word. Yeah, she's that dumb. She also told me it was my problem and to get over it. It won't be that long. Says the womanwho has a history of needing dog sitting for a month and having excuses as to why she ""can't"" have them right now a year later. 

   I'm livid.",JUSTNOMIL
"9 months ago my mom kicked me, my boyfriend, my dogs, my dad and my 6 week old son out of the house. I cried alot that day and it emotionally drained me. 9 months later I have my own apartment w my bf and dad who have supported me so much since that day. Since then, I am happier and I don't have to deal with ""your dogs are gonna kill your baby"" ""just drop out of school"" type of remarks. I have not talked to her since we got kicked out and skipped out on every family party or holiday. Anyways, I just recently graduated with a bachelors and did not invite her to the commencement. She was butt hurt and ended up asking my dad asking if she and I could talk. I turned her down. She wants me to apologize, wants me to move back in, but ON HER CONDITION that I can't take my dogs and my boyfriend can't stay with us (when literally my bf and my dogs and son are my REAL family). She's honestly crazy and I KNOW she just wants to USE me to see her grandson, take MY hard earned money once I get this job, and verbally and emotionally abuse me everyday like she used to. She's the type of mother who victimizes herself, hates when shes wrong or when you give attitude, and cares too much about money and is irresponsible with money. I could go on but I need to stand my ground when I go to my sister's graduation and have to face her. I'm not taking my son to this event because both me and my boyfriend agree she doesn't deserve the luxury of seeing her one and only grandson.

Side note: I was guilt-tripped by my sisters to let her in the birthing room. They said she should be in my birthing room because she's my ""only mom"" ""first grandchild"" bs. I regret letting her in the room in the first place because all she did was yell and offered ZERO SUPPORT both me and my bf told her to shut up. She didn't believe my ability to be a good first time mom and made fun of me breastfeeding saying I had no nutrients.

Anyways, thanks for reading my rant. Feel free to leave me supportive messages bc I need it. I don't want to start fights and I just want to end contact with her and get my message across (because she's narrow-minded), but I have the tendency to get a bit too emotional when I get mad.",JUSTNOMIL
"So every weekend my MIL pressures my husband and I to come stay for some tiny reason, last week she needed help with her RV box. Now here's the thing my younger sister rents a room from her and is entirely capable of fixing these stupid things but MIL makes DH come and then MAKES us stay the night she will even take our washing after I said a million times no so we have to stay overnight while it dries  (I don't have many clothes if my washing is gone I won't have anything to wear the next day). I'm so sick of this I tell my husband I don't want to go many times. Guess what? Staying again tonight cause husband agreed to stay the kicker is I was cooking  slow cooked ribs and had to stop to go over as if I don't MIL gets pissy and tells DH we should split.

"new user [29f], but my JH(ell)NMIL already has a name by me. 
Boyfriend [25M]'s family is a collection of females that are the most cliché definition of bad femenine traits. Childish, abusive, overly-passive and submissive, or WARRIOR WOMEN WHO NEED NO MAN because no human being would handle their hysterical nature...so on.
They are his mom's side of the family (bf is an extramarital affair from his dad, who was actually an Ok FIL until his passing), where there are NO MALES. Except boyfriend's uncle, who left to the USA and cut all ties with his family. 

If someone wanted examples of female entitlement and toxic behaviour, you just need Boyfriend's Family or as I call them... ""The Harpy Nest"". 
Out of the three awful human creatures, the leader of them all in nastiness and ruthless nature is my MIL.

She is such a modern and independent you guys, a female warrior that raised her son alone and is such a fighter, and sooooo successful while being into politics.
And she will break you if you don't fit on what she wants you to be.

I can talk about the abuse my boyfriend endured under her oh so protective wings, but I swear it triggers my anxiety to even remember how emotionally stunted my boyfriend was until we started dating. Trust me, it's like teaching a robot how to love...Tiresome, but rewarding.

No, this post is about Mother Harpy decided to pull some bullshit story to get a RO on my boyfriend and I.
MH never liked me, she made it clear from square one that I was an Invasive Species on her perfect ecosystem of mental abuse to my boyfriend, because I (GASP!) made him realize he was depressed and drop out from University to pursue a far more fulfilling and interesting career she had no control over!

Boyfriend had to leave his home after a really awful fight, and live with FIL, who had his faults but tried (until his death) to be a father for BF. When FIL died, the trueborn sons and daughters of him decided they would sell the apartment and Boyfriend had to return with Mother Harpy. We were alone packing everything up and I helped out of my heart for almost four days.

She was SO HAPPY to have her son under her rotten Avon nail polish splattered claws...Until this day!

The day I'm talking about I was visiting boyfriend on the now shared home/harpy nest with MH. We live apart and kinda wish it stayed that way forever and a day if MH is alive. 

I was busy cooking lunch and rightout ignored her, because I learned that she plain out hated my guts and while she liked to fake things, I wasn't going to...Her stare could freeze a volcano when she is trying so hard to manipulate things to her pleasure, I swear.
I can only paraphrase/figure out things from this point, because I was so focused cooking that I didn't listen to BF and MH arguing (Almost like I did it on purpose.../s)

Somehow, both got in an argument. Momma Harpy was mad because we were eating, and hungry, and she hated we touched the fridge. Things got really worked up, because what happened next was a sign she pushed and pushed BF to his boiling point on purpose.

Boyfriend got mad and, on the few times he became slightly violent, he hit on a second fridge they had. I'll never hear the whole story from either part because no one knew what the hell happened... Until she decided out loud that maybe she should press charges of domestic violence because he hitted a fridge. Ya know, the woman that hit, mentally and emotionally abused her son since he was 5yo...We kinda chuckled later at that.

Problem is, that as a woman, they would totally believe her (I was as witness she was NOT assaulted nor threatened, boyfriend just hit that fridge door and left to his room).
We have serious laws regarding domestic abuse reports in my country, and women do get too many benefits on these and many mean-spirited women use it to get revenge on partners and limit child visits and so on. This is actually a serious problem here, and while the law does help true abuse victims, false alarms are way more common. 

We knew she was going to get us a RO or worse, and my boyfriend had nowhere to go! My parents were and are against him staying more than the weekends.
We decide to denounce her first.
We ran from the house, her kicking us out screeching like the proper Harpy she is. And we went to a police apartment specialized in Family and Domestic Problems.

I'll never forget how sad and angry we were, how he had to go alone to talk not only about this threat of hers, but explain the abuse he endured since he was 5yo. We pushed the denounce until BF decided he wasn't going to press charges out of fear of being kicked out.

I understood and, while I was hurt, we agreed we would not go to his house anymore. He saw how distraught I felt.
We only stay there when she goes on vacation, and I have to make sure there are no trace of me, NONE. 

And this, along many more stories, is my MIL, the Mother Harpy. Promise I'll try to share another!

Thankfully my mother was as good as a MIL could be with my boyfriend until her passing last year, even if she didn't fully like him...She did hate my MIL tho. Last days in the hospital she couldn't help but curse her and laugh at her sorry ass. Thanks mom, I miss you! :(",JUSTNOMIL
"I don’t really know where to begin so here we go.  FTP, LTL, on mobile, etc. 

I have been NC with my JustNo/Narc Mother for almost 6 months. It has been great except for the occasional FM in the form of my aunt, and cards. 

We moved far, far away from her and initially did not give her our new address. I had a noodle spine moment and said it was okay for my aunt to give her my address so she could send my children something. That’s when the cards started. First they were for the children, who are both young and thankfully oblivious the fact that Grandma doesn’t have all the nuggets to her Happy Meal. After they got Easter cards, D(ear)H got a birthday card. Then a card for our anniversary, only addressed to him. He just received a Father’s Day card today. They never say anything beyond the message of “Happy _____”. DH is supportive of me going NC. I can’t figure out if this an attempt to manipulate my husband or myself, or what the point of it all is. 

I did not wish her happy Mother’s Day and she posted a picture of DH and I with the children that a cousin had posted and she stole (this is a classic move of hers and a story for another day). She did not send me a Mother’s Day card, which I could care less. Should I start sending the cards back? Any advice would be appreciated.",JUSTNOMIL
"I just commented this on someone else's post and thought you guys might like it. I realize she's not MY mother in law, but my mother and I are very close and my grandmother and I... *were* but aren't really anymore. So I feel like her experienced are also kinda mine. Hope this is allowed. Please tell me if it's not. 

So here we go. 

My family was pretty poor. My mom has rheumatoid  arthritis and it really limits her ability to work. My dad, while sweet and smart, is a terrible parent and an equally bad adult. I genuinely think he has BPD, though he's only been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He is an alcoholic and used to do drugs pretty regularly, now he's in California so he kinda just smokes pot now.

One time, my mom called and asked my paternal grandmother for help getting groceries because my dad had spent all his money on cigarettes and beer. But she refused, saying she needed to lie in the bed she'd made. My brother was 3 and I was 10. She wouldn't even give her enough money to feed just us.

My mother hung up the phone, turned to me and I'll never forget it. Her face was livid. She turned to me and said, ""when she's old and rotting in a nursing home because no one wants to be around her, I won't buy her fucking *cat food* to eat."" And walked off.

I just remember thinking, damn I got a cool mom.",JUSTNOMIL
"I'm a nice person... I know it must be hard for my MIL to have an empty nest and have tried to make the transition easy on her. I've let her come to 2 of my ultrasound appointments and have tried to include her in things, but it got way out of hand... She now thinks that she can insert advice in my husband and I's lives. She was sending him homes in the place where she lives for us to look at, but we made it clear that 1. We cannot afford a house and 2. We do not want to live there. She has offered for my husband to move back home... Literally, in front of me, his 6 months pregnant wife. What.

Anyways, my husband went over to his parents house alone one day and his mom said that she will be mad if one of his aunts sees the baby before she does. Okay... Now bear with me.

This is not my first pregnancy. I had a miscarriage a few years ago (very early on) and it sucked. On top of that, I moved countries to be with my husband (USA to EU). Everything is very new to me and I don't speak the language here, plus his mom controls everything (FIL confirmed that she has got to stop doing this).

When I deliver the baby, I told my MIL I did not want any visitors at the hospital. I want a calm time with my son and husband before MIL comes in and doesn't shut up. (She has even gone on to act like we are naming our son after her because their names share a few of the same letters...?) 

Anyways, husbands brother and his wife are amazing and speak English fluently. I feel comfortable around them and I know they will respect my wishes, so I really wanted a special time for just us five (me, DH, SIL, BIL, and baby). Now I'm concerned about MIL's reaction when she finds this out. I feel like she told my husband what she did behind my back so that she could manipulate the situation. I 100% get that she is excited, but I was also straightforward with her that I didn't want anyone at the hospital (at the time, I had not planned on having my BIL and SIL come see me). I feel that since I was straightforward, then she should have approached me and not my husband. After all, he isn't the one in the hospital, I am. 

My sister told me that I am being ""unfair"" and what what I'm doing by letting BIL and SIL seeing the baby first is ""just a really crappy thing to do."" 

What do you guys think?",JUSTNOMIL
"Hope i picked the right flair no advice is needed but if anyone has any it will be welcomed.

Haven't been here in a while but i really need to get this out.

The last time i posted was about my mother wanting me to go to Mexico for my siblings confirmation, well she had asked my SO again and he again just told him to please ask me directly and not him. I only knew about this because she went insane for a photo he posted on BookFace.

My oldest daughter isn't my SOs biological daughter but he still loves her and treats her the same as our little one (with the obvious difference that she needs a little more of attention since shes still a baby). I have never seen him treat her differently, he's a great father but i guess im not here to talk about him. Well he got a new iPhone after breaking his really old iPhone 5 and we were trying out the camera. He ended up with a really nice picture of the 3 of us (DD2, him and i) our oldest was playing around with her friends so she wasn't in this picture. He uploaded the photo and Hell came to us. 

JNMom called him a bastard, and was livid about her ""baby"" not being in the picture. She threatened to call the police on us for neglect or have her friends come take DD1. During the course of 3 days she would call me and him frome different numbers to demand we send our oldest to her since we don't love her and make her apart, that the picture says everything, we don't need to explain, just to give back her baby so she can be loved.  She made a huge scandal about it in our hometown and i was pissed, we have hundreds of pictures with her and he has a dozen of uploaded photos with her on his social media and just because this one time she wasn't there we are awful parents? Wtf??? I personally took down my account a couple of weeks ago and made a new one where she is blocked included with my siblings, some aunts and friends. My SO also blocked her in every social media and is still mad and sad, he started to believe her lies about him treating the girls differently. 

I'm kind of glad he finally got to see her truest and he has finally understood the NC with her. And her grand prize will be to never meet DD2 and probably never seeing again her ""baby""

Also for context DD1 is 6 years old and DD2 is 6 months old. Thank you for your time lovely people, have a nice day and hopefully with 0 craziness, i really needed to let this out now im going back to drink some coffee.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hey everyone. It's been some time since my last post. Mother actually apologized and admitted fault since my last post. Since then they have been balls to the wall with rug sweeping and hanging out like a good ol' family. It has been a little uncomfortable for me and BF, but we thought we would try it out. During the phone call apology, we agreed that we wouldn't let anything fester and always bring up issues we have around when they happen. Well I should have known what that means for Nmom. So on to the story,

&amp;#x200B;

So since we were not talking before the beginning of this month, my best friend was planning a baby shower for me, and my BFs cousin was doing one back in his home town for his side of the family. Since mother and I have made up, I let her know Friend was throwing this one for my and BF's friends and his cousin was handling his family in his hometown. If she was interested, she could throw one with Aunt(who volunteered to throw one) in July. She agreed to this and I thought we were done. Now originally, since mother and I were not talking, Friend and I wanted our grandmothers there. Our grandmothers are best friends and it has been a long standing thing with the four of us. So I let my grandma know, and she knew not to mention it to mother, all was good. Well I blundered. Yesterday evening, mother called me and the conversation went like so:

&amp;#x200B;

Mother: Hey so is your shower this saturday?

OP: It is this weekend, why whats up?

M: Well I was wondering if your dad and I could come by on Sunday and see the baby room and what you got.

OP: Oh well its actually Sunday, but we don't have plans for next Sunday if you like to come out then. 

M: Oh okay, thats fine. So the theme is dinosaurs right?

OP: Yep, pretty much we are going for a more generic dino theme, Friend and I went shopping with Friend's Mom for decorations last monday for it. (See this is where I start slipping, I start giving details. I need to gray rock better, or just stop talking to this woman)

M: Oh Friend's Mom?

OP: Yeah, shes hosting the party for Friend and helping out with costs and location. Friend lives in a 2 bedroom apartment. She can't have 30 people in there. 

M: Oh okay.. so Friend's Grandmother is probably going to that one?

OP: Uh yeah, so is my grandma since they are friends.

M: Oh I see, well I will talk to you after the shower so we can plan our visit. 

OP: Okay byebye.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I thought that was the end of it. Nope. I go to get a nails done for the shower and she calls back.. then texts ""Please call me when you have a minute.."" Well sh\*\*, I text BF and say she is going to try to get into this shower I bet. (Spoiler, she didn't outright say it, but I bet if I acted her way I would have been inviting her) So I call her back. To keep this a little short I am going to get through the beginning part. She asks me if I have a 10-15 minutes to talk, I explain that I do what is going on. She goes on to say she is unsure how to put this into words but we said that if we have something bothering us we would tell the other party and that there was something in the phone conversation that bothered her.. So after fumbling around for minute she finally goes

&amp;#x200B;

M:Okay, so when we talked about the baby showers, you said that Friend was doing this one for all your friends, and BFs cousin was doing the one for his family in X town and that I could do one here at the house for our side of the family, but after that phone conversation it doesn't seem that way and I just wanted to know why you lied? 

\--Record scratch-- this woman just called me a liar. 

So I say, I didn't lie, why does it matter? I don't feel like I need to justify my guest list. 

M:Oh no, I am not saying that you do. Now you are getting angry, we said we would talk about this stuff and its hard when you get angry. You don't need to be so defensive.

OP: Okay mom, Friend is throwing this shower. her mother was kind enough to offer her home for HER DAUGHTER to host this party, Friend isn't in the best place right now to do this so her mom is helping her do this. I wanted Friends grandma there and my grandma because the grandmother/granddaughter has been a thing for our whole lives.(literally, We were toddlers playing in pool together in my grandma's backyard and her grandma was right next door. They had a connecting gate to the yards.) Excluding those people, the rest of the guest list is BF's Friends and mine. Now when this shower was planned, we were not talking and I was not going to bring that into a party with my friends. So I chose to keep it this way because it is what I wanted. 

&amp;#x200B;

She was then silent for a solid minute or more. Wouldn't be surprised if I was put on mute as she whispered to dad. I almost hung up and wish I did. She comes back and goes. 

&amp;#x200B;

M:Well now you are being defensive and we said that we would talk about these things. So I am trying to tell you about my feelings here but its hard when you are so defensive. 

OP: You haven't even told me why this upsets you. 

M: Well are you going to be so defensive about it if I do?

OP: -silent-

M: Okay well, we(now bringing in my dad in this) were confused because you said it was friends and its obviously not. I mean its at Friend's Mom's house, so this isn't like its being held at a random friends house. We know Friend's Mom(my dad and her mom were neighbors growing up, why me and Friend are so close is because grandmas were friends and we spent summer vacations together) So I don't see why we weren't invited but your grandma was. I mean we are feeling left out here as the grandparents. Can't you see that?

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I shut down. I just say okay. and she asks if I have anymore questions, I say no and she said okay well.. we can talk later. and we hang up... BUT HOW CAN THIS WOMAN SIT THERE AND MAKE MY BABY SHOWER ABOUT HER AND HER FEELINGS. WHO DOES THESE TYPE OF THINGS? I am so over it. BF is says I have the right to feel upset about this and that I am not overreacting but some days I just feel like I am. So everyone, how would word this to woman that she is being ridiculous and that this isn't even a party for her, its for my baby, me and BF. Also how would you word that grandparents don't get jackshit specialness. That the baby should be enough and they should be damn grateful that BF and I are were even considering letting them in our baby's life.

"hey all! i figured i should come back with a story at some time. this is the (most recent) batshit insane event to have happened, and the situation has pretty much resolved itself.

so for those of you who aren't terribly familiar with my story, hi! i'm u/ifyouleavethelighton, and i moved 500 miles away from my sexually, emotionally, and financially abusive mother after she tried to take my medical power of attorney. i've started telling my story on here so i can process it with a community alongside processing it in therapy, and hopefully so i can have a good giggle about just how silly her attempts to get me living under her roof again are. 

as i mentioned in the title, this story has to do with a supposed warrant for my arrest. it started on the evening december 28th (a friday), when my aunt messaged me over facebook right as i was leaving work. at the time i lived an hour and a half away from my job (i decided to move for a job that wasn't worth it, realized my mistake five months later, and worked to get back to the city i'm living in now) and since it was winter in the upper midwest, i figured it would be safest for me to focus on driving rather than get stressed out by whatever hell was no doubt being thrust upon me. 

the weather was awful (freezing rain, low visibility) and i got into a car accident. my car slid off the road and into a ditch, thankfully without hurting myself or anyone else. unfortunately, the crash (and several fuck ups on the county sherrif department's behalf) wound up costing me all of my savings. naturally, i was panicked and devastated and completely forgot that i had a facebook message awaiting me until the following monday, the 31st. 

while on my break, i read the message, and found out that my mom had told my aunt (her sister-in-law) that i had a warrant out for my arrest and needed to appear at the mayor's court on january 2nd in order to fix it. for those of you who don't know, a mayor's court exists in only a few states (one of which being the one my family lives in) and is used to handle misdemeanors. from my understanding of the situation, if i had actually done something, i would have to appear in court or be arrested. i freaked out, called my partner, started looking through the online docket, told my boss, and posted here (on an old throwaway account). after several hours of chaos, tears, and phone calls, and several more days of sleeplessness, i eventually settled into the realization that it was, in fact, fake. 

from what my partner, therapist, and i can gather, this was a crazy plot she hatched in order to get me back to ohio and manipulate me into staying. first, the timing: i recieved the message on a friday evening, after the offices i would have tried to call would have been closed. they would remain closed on the weekend, as well as the 31st and 1st (new year's eve and new year's day, both holidays). in order for me to appear in court, i would have had to drive eight to ten hours to get to ohio, meaning i most likely would have left to get there before the office opened, and she knew that i refuse to be on my phone while driving, and while in my panicked state would have driven straight there without stopping. second, she banking on my partner having traveled back home to visit family for the holidays (a correct assumption) so i wouldn't have my main support network to come with me, therefore making me even more easily manipulated. third, she considers herself to be a master manipulator - she was able to fool teachers, babysitters, neighbors, and family members by painting me as a horrible, manipulative (yet very vulnerable and ""a bit slow"" to justify the fact that her ""baby"" still needs mommy to sit in on doctor's appointments and school guidance counselor meetings) and had managed to manipulate me particularly well. i'm not sure what she would have used (probably everything in her arsenal), and it makes me feel sick just thinking about it. she had anticipated me being weak - and while even the mere thought of her makes my blood run cold, i've grown a hell of a lot since i moved out. 

what she didn't anticipate was me not buying it. 

i don't know the aftermath of this story. i've spent the past six months waiting for the other shoe to drop, but it's been radio silence on her end. fingers crossed she got the message that i'm not buying her shit anymore (which is doubtful), or she's planning something worse. the good news is, i won't have a permanent address for at least two more years (every time my lease goes up, i'm moving apartments) and i gave my boss any numbers she might call from in the event that she somehow finds where i work and demands to know where i live or my phone number or whatever, and said if the numbers keep calling to call the police. i'm working really hard to keep my life as far away from her horrible claws as possible, and hopefully one day i won't have to deal with her shit anymore. 

anyway, as always, thanks for reading! &lt;3 i hope life is treating y'all well",JUSTNOMIL
"Man do I have some stories about this woman. I guess I'll start with one of the most traumatising. 

Mandatory background: I'm intersex, which means that I have a combination of male and female sex traits. At birth doctors performed invasive surgeries (none of which were consented to or even documented, unfortunately that's a thing that commonly happens to IS babies) and I was raised as female. Turns out I'm male.

I came out as transgender initially, I found out the intersex stuff later. As far as I was aware at the time, if I looked female down there, I was female, and any other male traits were irrelevant. NMom is very... traditional. I'd come out as gay a few years prior, and she was LIVID. Needless to say, she didn't take this news well. Initially, she demanded that I don't tell anyone about it. She then proceeded to not talk to me for an entire summer except for to yell at me for stupid shit. This is a good time to note that she's been abusive my whole life, and while I'm familiar with her tactics, they're no less traumatising to experience. Said yelling happens frequently and is super distressing.

I spent 2 weeks on vacation in a different country in the same apartment as her that summer. Not only was she making her own life difficult by being awkward about my very existence, she also made sure I knew that my disability was an inconvenience to her and started a shouting match on multiple occasions to tell me I was ruining her vacation (I was just existing and being my neutral self. She was the one causing a huge fuss.)

After returning from vacation, she still continued to have a problem with everything about me. Her bullying me for being disabled only got worse. I eventually wrote her a letter recommending resources and meetings she could attend to educate herself (she made 0 effort and immediately shredded the letter), and went out of her way to tell me in person that I was ruining her life.

Throughout all this, my dad had been fairly supportive of me (later realised he enables her abuse and is super gaslighty but that's irrelevant for the purposes of this story) and this had been causing a lot of arguments and strain on their marriage. Despite knowing that she wasn't welcome in my private space, NMom invited herself into my room regularly to tear through all my belongings and look at very private things, yell at me for said private things and repeatedly tell me she and my dad were going to get divorced, and it was all my fault. They're still together.
At some point during this whole saga, dad informed me that NMom had said she'd ""rather be dead than deal with [him]"".

My school at that time once called NMom about something irrelevant, and proceeded to share the full details of my transition in school despite knowing that would put me in danger. She was able to track down all of my social media, so I couldn't use any of it for months and then had to change my full name to protect my identity from her. Thanks, school!

The final part of this saga to date, that I can remember as of right now anyway, was when I finally discovered that I'm intersex and thought her bullshit would finally end when I was able to show her the solid proof.
She accused me of fabricating medical documents and refused to speak to my doctors.

Thanks for reading! I'll probably share some more of her nonsense on here soon!",JUSTNOMIL
So I have been NC for 3 years (or thereabouts) now with JNMIL and basically the whole side of DH damn family.  Its was years in the making to go NC which happened by the slow bleed of a billion paper cuts  coupled with a few key death blows by the JustNo and I was done finally.  I have a hunch that a conversation with a Brother in Law is going to be happening as he has been hinting that he'd like the family to be able to hang out again.  I haven't spoken to him in years however as I'm rehearsing what I'm going to say my reasons for going NC .....I start to panic.  That I don't have the right words to describe the experience with the bitch so as to dispel any doubts in someone else's mind.  This feeling reminds of how many years I spent doubting myself while trying to keep the peace in the family --thats how shitty it is to deal with a Narcissistic MIL -- I ended up blaming myself for the relationship failure for years.  Ugh.  Anyway I digress.....I need some sure fire comebacks for the BIL that explain what a crappy person my MIL was to me without having to go on and on to plead my case.  If anyone has any good one liners about regarding the decision to go NC I'm all ears.  thank you in advance:),JUSTNOMIL
"I think I did the flair right. 

JNMIL has been a sore spot in my life for nearly 22 years. I have some stories that cause could make anger boil in you but I’ll give you the most recent. It happened a few years ago but it still just annoys me to death. 

I have three daughters. For the longest time we lived across the country because of my DHs job. JNMIL was annoying but she lived so far away that I didn’t really deal with her. Yay me. 

When we moved closer home (about 6 hours away) we decided to let her have our kids for a few days during summer vacation. Our kids were already going to her area to visit FIL (they are divorced) so we figured they should go see her too. Now the only reason we were okay with this is that the girls were a bit older (oldest was 13/14) and we figured she couldn’t do much harm. Oh lawd were we wrong. 

The woman decided to take our kids to church while she had them. At the time we were Catholics, so I didn’t so much have an issue with church but she never asked if she could take them. Also, she had never been a church goer to our knowledge before this visit. 

She took them to some backwoods, fire and brimstone church. Never in a million years would we have been okay with her taking our kids there. Had she asked, she’d have been flatly told no.

Now, we are a pretty liberal family. My 14 yo best friend was a gay kid she had known for many years. One of my dearest friend at the time was a gay guy who I adore and even went on vacation with him. We are not the ones to preach hate towards gay to by anyone. 

So the pastor at this church apparently preached quite the sermon on how god hates gays and christians shouldn’t accept them. It was quite traumatizing to the 14yo.

After church JNMIL dropped kids off at FIL house and my kids filled SMIL in on what they had experienced. My 14yo went as far as to tell JNMIL that, “My mom is going to be pissed when she hears what you took us to today.” 

My SMIL called us and told us everything. Luckily my younger two (6 and 9 at time) didn’t actually pay attention to the sermon, but the 14yo was LIVID. 

We called JNMIL and she denied that the sermon was hateful. She said she didn’t think we’d have an issue with the girls going to church with her. And she had no idea what they were preaching on before she went to church. 

We found out the name of the church and searched it on the web. We were able to not only find the church, but we were able to listen to the sermon. It was filled with hate and yelling. And it was part two in a three part series so she damn well knew what the service was on. We immediately determined the kids couldn’t visit her again without supervision (aka my dh because I dont visit the crazy). 

Fast forward six years.... our youngest daughter tells us she’s gay. We of course have no issues and celebrate her announcement. She however remembers JNMIL and the church. So she wants nothing to do with her grandmother.  My dh made it clear to her and a few other family members that any negative words about our daughter being gay or about gays in general will result in NC immediately. No second chances. 

Just another day in the life with Captain Crazy.",JUSTNOMIL
"TL:DR; I can’t afford to go to my cousin’s out-of-town wedding. After many mishaps, cancellations, and un-cancellations I finally outright refuse my mother’s help because I can’t handle changing my plans for a 5th time. 

Hi all. So, my cousin is getting married tomorrow in Alabama, and I live in Indiana. It’s about a 7 hour drive for us. We had planned to go, because my mother told us that there was going to be a place to stay on Friday and Saturday nights. All is well, until about a week out. 

My phone went bad, and we had a few other unexpected kid-related expenses. Nothing out of the usual with two small children, but now we could no longer afford to attend the wedding. Because my phone crapped out, I didn’t have anyone’s contact information anymore, so I asked my mom for help letting them know. Thought that would be the end of things. Told the music leader and children’s director at church that we would be there, after all, so they didn’t need to replace us anymore. Silly me. 

Wednesday night, my dad calls while I’m putting the kids to bed. Asks how much money it would take for us to be able to go. I tell him I appreciate the help, but they’ve helped us so much, and because we couldn’t pay them back in a reasonable time, we just aren’t comfortable with that. And besides, we already cancelled and made different plans. He seems to understand. 

My mom texts me offended. Says I’m punishing her because she didn’t have an extra phone to give me (we asked, only because it was worth a shot, and didn’t even once indicate that we were upset over it), says she doesn’t know what she’s done to deserve this, they’ve done so much to help us, she’s so offended that we didn’t bring the kids over on Easter or Memorial Day (she didn’t ask us, she doesn’t even celebrate Easter), and just basically is trying to guilt me into taking the money. I text her what I told my dad on the phone and go to bed. 

Next morning, dad texts saying “I never said you had to pay us back.” And we just. We were so done, so we said “okay, sure. If you want to help so badly, we’ll take the money and go.” We tell everyone “sorry, things hanged again, we *wont* be here this weekend.”

A few hours later, we get a text that we don’t have somewhere to stay on Friday night after all, so they now will understanding we choose not to go, because that long a drive is unreasonable to put two little kids through and then expect them to sit through a wedding almost immediately after. We wait a while, then say to everyone at church “Oh, ignore that. We’ll be here. Sorry”

7 pm rolls around. I’m getting a ton of texts in my group chat between my parents and siblings but it’s bed time so I ignore them. And then forget. 8 pm I get an angry text from my mother asking if I’m going. I told her earlier I wasn’t, so I am confused. They decided to rent hotel rooms for Friday. It’s 8 at night. We haven’t cleaned out the car. We haven’t packed. We already in the span of one day told the kids we were going, and then that we weren’t, and planned a trip to the zoo to make it up to them. We don’t want to be painted as flakey and unreliable by changing our plans *again,* so I just said we weren’t going. It was too late to change everything again. 

This morning, despite the fact that my mom knows we don’t have the money for gas to get there, she texts the address to the hotel “in case you change your mind!”

Am I being unreasonable here? Is it wrong of me to refuse to keep changing my plans and upsetting my children? I understand that my cousin is getting married, but I’m sure he can understand that things happen.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi, all! Yes, it is I - the 49F with the 72 year old ""Registered Carer"" (but not so's you'd notice!) Mum! This is just a bit of an update with some good news. You may remember that I posted some days ago about hopefully getting a lift to my hospital appointment with Dial A Ride (transport has been a real problem for me). Well, that was yesterday and it all went very smoothly - I was picked up &amp; dropped off without any hassle, and it didn't cost me a penny! Wonderful! Now I know the system works, I can use it for all sorts of things, which is terrific. So that's good news!

The next bit of good news is that Mum's ""probably"" not coming to my novicing on Monday. I wasn't going to say anything but she hadn't forgotten (boo!). I told her that she was welcome to come, but could only stay for the first part of the evening &amp; would need to get step-dad to take her home afterwards, as she couldn't stay for the entire meeting. She said, ""Oh, I think we'll just let you go under your own steam - you don't really need us there!"" She seemed pretty relieved tbh - I wonder if she's scared of angering step-dad over asking for a lift back? Just a thought. Still, at least that problem is solved!

She is still complaining about her cousin like mad - she sent me 4 emails over the last couple of days which don't actually make any sense. She sent me links to some stuff Cousin has done online about the family tree, which she has apparently ""made a mess of"", and Mum would ""love my opinion"", but I couldn't get any of the links to work! I appreciate it sounds muddled, and it is! I don't really understand what's going on. Mum phoned earlier to say she had confronted Cousin over the family tree confusion, and was really annoyed when Cousin said, ""Oh sorry, I've been very busy - I'm writing a novel!"" ""Ooh,"" I said to Mum. ""That sounds interesting!"" mum got quite annoyed and said, ""No, turbo, NO! Not good! She is so full of her own importance!"" it's painful to listen to, as you can imagine, and I'm annoying Mum by not joining in with the slagging-off! Ah well, I should have a peaceful rest of the day now though!",JUSTNOMIL
So funny update from my story. My mil refused to give me back the money I prepaid for the internet and told me to get it back from Comcast. I called Comcast told them what happened and they refunded my money. Mil sent us a picture of her bill today and asked why it was so high. My dh didn't answer her. Mil obviously thought she had screwed me on my money I paid for the internet just for her to be the one who got screwed in the end.,JUSTNOMIL
"Edit: No need for a plan! MIL has decided she wants to only see DH (she NEVER gets time to see him just alone) for a walk (two laps at least!) at a local reservation.  Maaayyyybe she will come by after to see our garden. DH admits it's likely a trap and he is going to make sure he drives himself and is ready to tell her that she's not welcome over. 

Whatever, I trust DH and I know this at least takes the pressure off me. I'm sure I will update soon. Thanks for all the support!

Original post:
I submitted something last week about the in laws and family events and through that post I realized that my MILs motivation is clearly to schedule events for her performance of the perfect family. 

DH and I have been trying to schedule a time to see her (as a compromise to mother's day weekend in the vacation house) for the past 2 weeks and it has been a pain in the ass. She finally agreed to see us on a date we chose but only after n email tantrum that reminds me of a 4 year old who doesn't get 2 pieces of candy at the grocery store. Her current complaint is that 3 hours of time is not enough to celebrate mother's day and ""this is news to her that we would have such a limited amount of time.""

I'm so frustrated with her 😡. We have been back and forth 5 times about this and she is always changing the expectations and her availability. At this point I just want to get the stupid visit over with. 

I'm feeling extremely anxious about her coming to our house and I  trying to make sure I have back up plans for if (when) things go south that I can protect myself. What do you think of my plan?

DH will remind her 30 minutes before the end of the visit that we need to wrap up

She will get a 3 strike warning for belittling comments made toward me or how we choose to live. I will say ""what do you mean?"" to cue DH that it's a rude comment and he will be giving the warnings. 

She will have a 3 strike rule for guilt trips before he comments that she's making the visit unpleasant. 

I have a plan for saying I don't feel well to leave the room if she refuses to leave.

Are there any other things I can do to prep myself and help me feel more confident that I'm not going to participate in a hijacking accusatory whiny guilt fest?",JUSTNOMIL
"I’ve posted once before then deleted it but the TL;DR of that situation was that my (self centered, always the victim, jocasta) MIL got my son(7) alone and told him how the uncle he was named after was killed. Warping the story to make it hurt him. Basically his uncle, my husbands brother, was murdered as an adult because of a drug situation. But my MIL told my son that his friends at school pretended to like him in order to trick him then shot him dead. This was said after learning my son was having trouble at school because of light bullying. 
This caused a huge issue for my poor son and I had to even homeschool him as a result of what she said since he now thinks no one is really his friend and there’s bad guys who could shoot him at any moment.  That was about a year ago and luckily my son is doing much better and were even going to try to put him back in public school later this year.
So if that wasn’t enough for MIL that same day she also cornered my teenage daughter(13) and told her how her aunt, husbands sister, was being beaten by her boyfriend and how scared MIL was that the aunt would wind up dead, etc. Basically not a conversation appropriate for a teenager and not to mention also not true at all. (Aunt and that bf are actually happy together and just had their first baby) Now my teenage daughter and I come from a very abusive prior relationship before I met my husband so this is another trigger type conversation I feel was designed to hurt my daughter. Which it did.
Ok so that was a long synopsis but as a result of all that me and my kids went NC with her. I mean duh lol.
My husband still talks to her but very rarely and he’s also unhappy with what his mom did. So all that was about a year ago and in that time frame MIL has not reached out to me once to try to apologize and explain any of her actions. She did however try to turn me into the bad guy and make herself the victim in this situation when my husband initially chewed her out over it. She says things like “your wife is keeping me from my grandchildren” “your wife has never made me feel welcome in your home” yada yada bunch of woe is me bullshit. Only ever said to my husband.
So now I’m cool with NC forever, that’s the dream, but recently she’s been making noise to my husband and pushing his faaaamilly guilt buttons and he’s been talking to me about attempting to make the situation right with his mom. I told him that there’s nothing to make right until she apologizes and takes responsibility for her actions and even if she manages that I refuse to allow her back into my home or even around my children. Since she has proven herself unsafe. But I get the impression that this is going to hurt my marriage down the road unless he sees me making at least some effort. So I decided to text her the other day, this is the first time either one of us has spoken since she said all that bullshit to my kids. Here’s what I said and her response. 

(https://imgur.com/a/I9EVIkY)
So now I need a little help crafting a response or even deciphering the muddle garbage that she sent as a text. I really don’t see any apology in there and if anything she seems to be saying that because shit with her daughter was stressful I should be understanding that she hurt my kids as a result?
Idk guys, I’m really overwhelmed and hope all this makes sense. Then I almost feel really disrespected that I took the time to craft a message for her that was clear and concise and the response she sends to me she couldn’t even be bother to proofread or be fucked to make sure it was understandable. Like I’m not playing some game with you lady, you hurt my children and the only reason I’m giving you a chance to redeem yourself is because I love my husband.",JUSTNOMIL
"Gentle advice please. 

My grandma is a sweet 75 yearold Christian lady, married at 19, never divorced, always made sure you leave her house with a full belly and a little bit of money. She also lives right next door to my family, close enough that we share a driveway (this is important). My grandma also pays a portion of my tuition, I was always told that I had an obligation to follow my grandmother's ""rules"" because of this. 

According to my mother, my grandma is the ""no living in sin"" type, pre-marital sex is unheard of, and I would have to face the monster if she caught wind that I spend nights with my boyfriend (I feel like it's important to note that I'm 21). When home from college, my mother would scold me if I was at my boyfriend's late at night, telling me that I better not be staying the night, what would grandma think?? Sometimes I would end up falling asleep while all cuddled up and watching Netflix, and I'd wake up in a panic at 6am, racing home before my grandma woke up and noticed my car wasn't there. One time, me, my boyfriend, and a group of friends stayed in a cabin, and I told her that the girls slept in one room and the boys slept in another, per my mother's request. 

I eventually got tired of having to tiptoe around my grandma, and flat out told her that I planned on spending the night with my boyfriend at his house in the city our University is in, because I wanted to make it in time for graduation without waking up at an ungodly hour. She didn't even bat an eye. 

So I've started spending nights with my boyfriend, and coming back home at around noon rather than racing back home before 7am. Never once has my grandma said a word to me about it. I had mentally prepared for the manipulation tactics and gaslighting from my mom, and the Jesus talks from my grandmother, but they never came. 

I think my mom has noticed that I know my grandma doesn't care too, she doesn't even text me to nag me into coming home anymore, she one time asked me if I planned on spending the weekend with my boyfriend. Where was this energy last year? Why was I always being scolded and having arguments with my mom about how I was an adult and I should be treated as such, not a high schooler with a curfew? 

It makes me wonder what else I could get away with, what other things that were pounded into my head that aren't actually a big deal to my grandma? I wouldn't put it past my mother to be telling me these things to have a bit of control on me, she once told me lies about how CPS works when I told her I considered calling CPS on my dad and stepmom (see post history). 

I'm moving out soon, like tomorrow soon. I feel like it's the calm before a storm. This time last year, my mom said if she catches me buying weed again, she'll tell my grandmother so she'll stop paying a portion of my tuition. Now, my mom says she doesn't give two shits if I smoke at the house as long as I don't do it inside, make it obvious, or get caught by my grandma. I don't know what's happening.",JUSTNOMIL
"I’ve been reading through this subreddit a while, and have been debating posting. Today my husband encouraged me to post, so here it goes: 

Backstory: I moved from another state to be with my husband. We met online. I had an apartment with 2 girls - we got evicted due to one girls friends. Husband was still living at home - he was 17, I was 18 - and MIL let me move in. 

I watched her manipulate him, abuse him, and ignore her daughters in the time I lived there. She would rage over everything and anything, and any time she had the chance to manipulate her kids, she would. She never had an up front issue with me. She once told me I did a better job with my now husband than she did. Probably cuz I treated him like a human being. 

Fast forward to my wedding. This bitch wore a white dress to my wedding. Which I didn’t realize was a big deal until a couple years later, but anyway. 

Fast forward to my husband joining the military. She told him she wasn’t coming to his basic training graduation because she had to work, just so he would be sad she wasn’t there and happy when she was there. Pure manipulation. 

Fast forward to us not living anywhere near her. I got pregnant. Immediately she acted she had some sort of claim to my child. My labor was difficult and ended in an emergency c section. When my son was finally born, we sent private pictures via text to certain family members. She was one of them. She posted the pictures on Facebook before we even announced his birth, and got mad when husband told her to delete them. 

Fast forward to husband leaving military. We decided to move to my home state. She got super mad about that, and attempted to bribe us to move back in with her. It didn’t work. 

Years later, husband loses his job. She told him not to yell too many people because CYS could be called and they could take my son, and she ‘would drive x amount of hours to get him before she let that happen.’ First of all, people lose jobs all the time. Second of all, no lol. My son would never go to her. 

Time jump a few more years. We end up getting screwed over and homeless, bouncing between family members houses. MIL makes an offer to get us a place but only in husbands home state, and it’s 5 minutes from her house. We didn’t have any other options - great.

That same year she bought us a car as a gift. It’s still in her name. We’re grateful, but it’s already been used in manipulation tactics so I’m kind of meh with it. 

It took a while, but we decided to allow our son to spend nights with her only if he wanted to. He was obviously verbal at this point, and I will not stop him from having a relationship with her as long as she doesn’t pull the same shit with him as she did my husband. So far, it’s been obnoxious shit. 

Her house is a shithole. It smells. It’s disgusting. She smokes in the house (she is not allowed to smoke in the house when my son is there and he will tell us if she ever does). My husbands mental health has been in a decline since being back in his home state. Today she got my son a shirt that says something along the lines of ‘dad knows some stuff mom knows everything’ which will be thrown out. She also came in with candy cigarettes and the first thing she said to my son was “are you ready to smoke!?” They will also be thrown away.

I guess it’s not much major. Just a lot of manipulation, past abuse for my husband, and a general lack of intelligence. Her attempts at manipulation do not work though.

The biggest problem is I don’t feel I can confront her on literally anything. Our home - we have it because of her. My car, because of her. Our brand new furnace because ours went out in December is also thanks to her. I’m grateful for the help she’s given us. I really, really am. But I know she’s helping to make herself feel good, and to have things to hold over our heads. We HAVE to be nice to her because she did all of these things for us. She knows it, and I know it. 

There’s a lot more I could include here, but it’s honestly long enough and this is kind of my first ever reddit post lol.

"LTL, FTP, I've been debating posting about my FMIL for a while because she isn't as bad as a lot of MILs I read about on here, but her BEC ways have gotten me so frustrated and angry and I need advice on how to deal with what has been going on.

&amp;#x200B;

  A little background, FD( dear)H and I have been together since high school. At that point I really wanted his mom to like me, we were close and she did help me through a lot of stuff that was going on in my life, but I started to realize that she was always looking for drama and thrived on it. She has also recently started a new job where she works with a lot of younger women, and has since become very annoying in trying to act younger. The way she talks has changed and she is constantly gossiping. She has also become jealous of my repaired relationship with my family. Overall I have gotten to the point where I just don't want to be around her and she has definitely noticed.On to the current issue:

&amp;#x200B;

  FDH proposed to me in front of my dad and siblings while on a vacation. He included his mom while purchasing my ring because the diamond was her moms. As soon as we got engaged he of course called her as she demanded, while we were trying to navigate and enjoy a busy U.S. landmark with my family. She kept making comments about how she wishes she could've also been there and giving herself too much credit with her role in picking out the ring. That sort of dashed my excitement. I had some people I wanted to tell before announcing it publicly, one being my own mom (my parents are divorced and my siblings aren't close with my mom, its a complicated relationship). When we were ready, my new Fiance and I coordinated a Facebook and Instagram announcement together, and we were flooded with congratulations and all of our friends and family sharing our excitement.

&amp;#x200B;

  Until I got a notification about being tagged in a post by his mom. She had created her own Facebook announcement saying how she has known us both from the beginning and is our biggest supporter etc...It was a very narc post but all of her friends were congratulating her and her husband, which made me upset because they were stealing our spotlight and excitement over the situation.  I felt all the people that needed to see out announcement were on either mine or FDH's friendlist and would see one of our posts. I never said anything to her, FDH agreed with me but reminded me that as he was her only son, she was of course going to be excited. 

&amp;#x200B;

  Fast forward a few months, and FDH is graduating from college. He decided,like me, to not walk. His mom was bitter over that since she found out and kept trying to guilt both of us trying to change his mind. Graduation day comes up and FDH makes his own post about it to keep his family updated. FMIL follows up with her own post about how she keeps seeing all of her friends pictures with their graduating kids and how her son is also graduating she just doesn't have any pictures of him since hes not participating in walking. Once again, all of her friends comment their congratulations to her and her husband, a few of them acknowledging FDH at least.

&amp;#x200B;

  And yesterday, with about a year to go until our wedding, I posted our engagement pictures on facebook and went to work. On my break I was looking at my comments when I come across a post from FMIL. She shared my pictures but put up her own caption. And of course again, all her friends, who are strangers to me, are congratulating her. Some of her friends were asking if it was her son, and she had one creepy friend comment that FDH was ""Sooooooo handsome"" with a ton of hearts following. These people have no clue who we even are, they don't need to be made aware of our wedding or see our pictures.

  

  I feel like she keeps stealing my thunder through facebook posts and making everything about her. Seeing her post yesterday ruined my mood, I don't like any of her posts like this as a passive aggressive way to let her know I don't approve, but I'm worried that if I don't vocalize it she will just keep posting things like this. She keeps trying to invade my wedding planning with things like inviting herself to come dress shopping with me, and my sister brought up the possibility of her posting pictures of me in dresses, or our STDs and wedding invites when we send those out, which I could definitely see happening.

&amp;#x200B;

  So I guess I just need some advice on how to approach this situation.I know that she is excited, but it isn't her wedding. I should be more excited than her but she keeps trying to steal the spotlight and make it about herself. I don't want to be too mean but I want to get my point across.  I am imagining that she will either giggle and downplay it like she did nothing wrong or throw a huge pity party about not being included.",JUSTNOMIL
"My FIL industry moved out of state.  He found work 6 hours away a couple of states over but Turditzen refuses to move there. Instead he drives home on the weekends and he sneakily sleeps in the office Mon-Thurs.  My In-Laws are in the 60 age range.  I don't mean to be ageist but at that age working and living like this is a big strain on the health.   Turditzen is delusional and  convinced he will eventually find a job where they live.   She has come up with so many excuses why she won't move.   Her biggest line of course is not being willing to leave her faaaaammilyy and grand babies.  When we announced our first pregnancy one of the first things out of her mouth was well I'm definitely not going anywhere now.  I was thinking oh you are deluded if you think this will change how often you see us which is already very limited.  And you can see from my post history her other selfish tendencies have made visiting her less and less likely.

Turditzen incessantly wines to DH about her husband's job, the same rant again and again for a couple of years now.   She uses FIL's normal complaints about the job then uses that as an excuse to not move for it. Also my DH (who is a contractor)  would kill for a job with salary and bennies like that and so its even more annoying to hear her wine about it.  

&amp;#x200B;

 It would also be dreamy to me if she did move hours away.... Although then she would come to visit and have to stay over with people, ugh. I believe this job isn't forever and you should support your husband and provider (she does not work) move there for a few years until he can find a job elsewhere or retire than move where you want to live.   Of course I have selfishly rooted for her to move hours and hours away so we didn't have to deal with her guilt ridden requests to see us more often but truly.  A man of 60 should not be sleeping under his desk at work.  Do you know how hard it is to eat healthy living like that?? 

&amp;#x200B;

Also when he lost his job in our current state his first job he took was in a state an airplane ride away. We were still both in the FOG at this time and when  she needed help at home with stuff and she would beg DH to come help with gardening, cleaning out house, etc and since she's alone and FIL wasn't around DH would comply and go spend an hour there that quickly became an all day into evening time.  She had some medical problems too and that became our problem to deal with helping her too.  I was OK at first when FIL had a temp job across the country but once I figured out that living like this was her choice we put our feet down and said no more. You want to live apart and you  need help to do so you deal with issues that come up. We are not running out to your suburb and hour away to enable you.    

&amp;#x200B;

Turditzen spiral downward into worse and worse behavior  is mostly because of this living apart situation.   Being alone during the week is not good and she doesn't take care of herself not eating or sleeping right. Drinking a ton of coffee and taking her oversupply of ridelin.  And thus being more unfocused, selfish, crazy, and grasping at family etc which affects us.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Turditzen refuses to move so FIL works 6 hours away sleeps in office/commutes on weekends.  Mostly a rant but don't mind some advice or give to me straight talk.",JUSTNOMIL
"\-   i AM MARRIED INTO A CRAZY CONTROLING FAMILY.

Hello everyone,

Update 3 about situation. So i decided not to attend my MIL birthday that will be in my own house against my wishes.

Today i told my husband i ll be traveling on her birthday and ofcourse he got so mad and told me he can't tell her i wont be there and that i should do it and i said ofcourse i will.

After texting her, she read and 6 hours later she replies. What about we still meet on my birthday and you travel later ?

I mean how could she ask me this ?? does she not have any commun sense?? I told her i need a change of air. I am emotionally exhausted and she tell me \*insterts my name\* you must be having hard time but What about we still meet on my birthday and you travel later ?

COME ON LADYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY. 

They controled their son his whole life and now it s my turn. None of them (MIL and FIL) will even meet their son without me !!!!!!

What is thiiiiiiis?

i m really shocked by her reply. Not that i was surprised that she will say some bullshit like this.

Why she and her husband never take NO fuck you NO as an answer.

Sorry for the caps i m super mega mad now.",JUSTNOMIL
"This got really long so I’m gonna put the TLDR on top.

TLDR: My FMIL and I fought earlier this year over her not trusting me because we aren’t close. Her and FDH’s Ex Fiancé were incredibly close though and FMIL trusts her because of that. Ex cheated on FDH with a (Ex)good friend of his. FMIL won’t hate Ex for that though cause FMIL has cheated before. In the middle of May FMIL told FDH “your next girlfriend will make you” in regards to him not going to a family event next year, while I was sitting right beside him. I found out after we left that she pulled him into a separate room away from everyone while I was out of the house to tell him Ex is moving back. This has made me incredibly paranoid that FMIL is plotting to get Ex and him back together. Am I overreacting?



So my fiancé(24M) and I(22F) have been together for two years, we own a house together, and I might be pregnant. I’m not going anywhere anytime soon and it should be pretty obvious considering we’re now engaged. But his mother hates me and I’m worried she’s plotting to break us up. Fmil is much closer to Ex than she ever was to me. FDH was engaged at 18 to his Ex who was 21 at the time, they were together for under a year when the engagement happened. She moved in with him and FMIL. So FMIL and Ex are much closer than me and FMIL are because they lived together for the entirety of the relationship(about two and a half years). They broke up because Ex cheated on FDH three times, you would think that’s cause FMIL to hate her but because FMIL has cheated on her husband she won’t get mad at Ex for cheating even though it completely broke FDH. Anyways when me and FDH first got together Ex messaged him and said FMIL told her we weren’t actually together and that Ex still had a chance with him. I shut that down real fast of course and we haven’t had any issues in two years...till now. Ex had moved back to her home state shortly after I put her in her place. FMIL and Ex talked every single day. I didn’t think much of it until after FMIL and I got into a big fight because I refused to make FDH go anywhere with her and she got made because “ex and FSIL both always helped me with the boys, why won’t you?” Because I’m not gonna make a grown man listen to his mom when he doesn’t want to? You’re not his boss and neither am I. It finally came to a head and I found out the real issue wasn’t that I didn’t make him do something, it’s that me and her aren’t as close as Ex was and so she doesn’t trust me. I haven’t done anything to make her not trust me, we just aren’t friends so she doesn’t like me(she told this to everyone including my mother). This happened a few months ago and things have been really rocky and shaky ever since. Well around the middle of May we went to an annual cookout at FMIL’s house. We were all joking around and FDH jokingly said something about not showing up next year, FMIL had the balls to say “Your next girlfriend will make you go.” While I was sitting right next to him. I didn’t say anything but as soon as she said it I made eye contact with FSIL(who btw has been a constant support during all of this) and rolled my eyes. FMIL might’ve saw it but if she did she said nothing, she just went inside shortly after I rolled my eyes and then didn’t come back outside where I was till we left. I found out after we left that FMIL had pulled FDH into a separate room away from EVERYONE while I was OUTSIDE to tell him that Ex was moving back into town next Monday. FDH told me after we left, I asked FSIL about it and she said she saw FMIL pull him into a different room but had no idea what it was about or that Ex was coming back. This has me EXTREMELY worried that FMIL and Ex are plotting to get them back together. I have really awful anxiety and paranoia though so I’m very worried I’m just overreacting. FSIL said she didn’t take the comment how I took it but she understood why I would feel that way. So I guess I’m just wondering if I’m blowing this out of proportion? 😅



Edit: thank you for responding!! I know for sure now that I am not overreacting and that this behavior FMIL is showing is definitely not okay or made up in my head! I’m very LC with FMIL and it looks like it probably needs to stay that way till she can figure out how to respect someone different than her. I have no worries about my FDH leaving me for his Ex and I absolutely will be taking precautions with FMIL and kiddo if I am pregnant!  Thank you for the advice, everything said has made me feel better about this. I’m confident FDH will side with me when FMIL tries something else and we will officially set NC or VLC boundaries for her.",JUSTNOMIL
"Long time lurker, first time posting!

FDH and I have been together for 6 years, and we are getting married this Halloween. His parents hate me and have no shame in expressing that they disapprove of our relationship.

Important to note, FDH just started an amazing new job a few weeks ago! We are so excited! The job provides life insurance, as I assume many do, but he also chose to take out an additional policy, which all comes out to a pretty sizable amount. Last night on his way to work, he gets a call from FMIL... wanting to know if he needs her social security number for the beneficiary paperwork. He explained that the process was completed weeks ago, and that I am the beneficiary he named... oh boy. She got SO upset. “Is it too late for you to change it? Whyyyy do you choose her, you know better than that! You’ll never remember to go back and change it after...”
After what, exactly? He called FMIL out on how she was acting, told her that I AM going to be his wife soon no matter how they like it, and she changed her tone to all “ohhh, I just didn’t know that’s how it’s supposed to work.”

Today I’m sure she’s telling her husband and anyone who would listen how I’m probably going to murder her son for the life insurance money, because that’s just how batshit crazy she is. 

How do you handle future in laws like this? How can I convince FDH this isn’t healthy at all?",JUSTNOMIL
"Jack-Ass-Ta messaged SO this morning asking if he blocked her from a post on FB. 

She couldn't see it because I have her blocked. We think someone asked about the picture, which of course she couldn't see.

""Tell her to please unblock your sweet momma""

SO told her he supported me keeping her blocked and that it was things like this that hindered any relationship rebuilding.

She responds in a long rant about how any woman who would block his mother has no respect for him, and when I am done using him up to give her call, but she'll probably be dead by then, she wishes she had died before he met me because I've turned him into a mother hating asshole, etc, etc, etc.

Oh and how he treats my mom like a queen (my mom is in a nursing facility, and we visit her once a week).

SO knows better than the bullshit she's spouting.
He said ""She's blocked. She keeps making this bed, she can continue to lay in it""

You don't get to call my kid a retard, and me a drug addicted, gold digging bitch AND get to be welcomed with open arms.

I still feel bad for SO for having to go through this with her.
It bothers me what she's telling other people about me.
I know it shouldn't, and in the long run it doesn't matter as long as we're happy, but still.",JUSTNOMIL
"I (23f) am newly engaged and told my parents. Not even 48 hours after the proposal, my mom has the guts to suggest making the public online announcement before I have the chance. I told her no and she was rather insistent which kinda forced me into advertising the ordeal online before she even had the opportunity because she absolutely would’ve. 

Additionally, she’s telling me who to have in my bridal party, insisting that my sister be my maid of honor and then have my SIL, my fiancé’s two sisters, one of my friends, and the church girl who my mother has kinda taken on as her own. I have a rather strained relationship with my sister and one of my FSIL and the other FSIL has vehemently expressed that she doesn’t wanna be a bridesmaid after the last wedding she was a part of. I don’t even know if I want a bridal party. 

We’re not even ready to plan any details. I still have another year of my master’s to finish up, but if this is what my mother is like in the first two days, well then holy shit.",JUSTNOMIL
"Welcome to part two of the saga. Please check BB for the previous part.

&amp;#x200B;

So my story continues on Sunday afternoon. You see AIL and her bf couldn’t get leave for Monday and decided to leave late Sunday afternoon. Family friend also had to leave early cause his wife was under the weather and he needed to get back and help out. It was supposed to be me, DH, Fil and Beelzebaby for the next two days, but lo and behold, Beelzebaby and Fil appear with their bags and tell us their leaving.

&amp;#x200B;

Both DH and I were surprised when they told us we could spend the next two days in the cabin alone. I knew it was too good to be true. We had one magical night alone watching tv and gorging ourselves on potato salad. I should have known the bliss would not last.

&amp;#x200B;

The very next morning DH and I are out for a drive when Fil calls to tell us that he and Beelzebaby are coming back. According to him, he and Beelzebaby didn’t get any quality time with DH and me and they want to spend the last night with us.  The way he said it, made it sound like he blamed the lack of quality time on us. The whole time Fil was delivering what sounded like a well rehearsed speech, I could hear Beelzebaby yell instructions and tell him what to say. Fil told us that we would be making burgers and eating them around a bonfire. Or should I rather say I could hear Beelzebaby yelling at him to tell us how things were going to be and he simply repeated everything.

&amp;#x200B;

I was pissed. DH was pissed. I felt like this was just another Beelzebaby bid to be in charge and have us act out her vision of a perfect family. I was angry that Beelzebaby thought she could just swoop in and take over. So I decided not to let her. I suggested to Dh that we take Beelzebaby and Fil out to dinner at a local lodge as a thank you and sold it by reminding him that there would be not quality time with his folks as long as Beelzebaby was isolating herself in the kitchen.

&amp;#x200B;

He thought the restaurant idea was great, so he immediately called up Fil and informed him of the change of plans. In fact he told Fil that he and I were going to the lodge and they could join us (or not). Guess who was not happy about it…  Beelzebaby grabbed the phone and started with “No, lets just get one thing straight-”. I never heard the rest cause at that exact moment the line went dead. No signal. Dh and I waited twenty minutes to call her back and by then she had ranted herself out. She told us she was fine to eat at the lodge. 

&amp;#x200B;

They arrived after four, with Beelzebaby already displaying CBF. Things went downhill immediately. You see while I was inside, taking a shower and getting dressed, Beelzebaby thought it would be cute feeding muffins to some local wildlife. When I got outside she seemed smug that she was able to lure some animals in by tossing pieces of muffin on the grass infront of the cabin. DH and Fil were doing nothing. I first lost my shit at Dh and asked him why he wasn’t saying anything. He gave me the deer in headlights look (He got an earful from me later). So I ended up giving Beelzebaby a good earful. I won’t bore you with the details, but one of my main points was that she could attract dangerous animals by leaving food out on the lawn (This is important for part 3).

&amp;#x200B;

Needless to say after my reprimands I was about as popular as the plague with her. We got to the lodge and she looked like she was sucking lemons the whole way. For the next part to make sense I have to state that while it is pretty hot in the area during the day, the night time temperatures are pretty cool, even for this time of the year. I dressed nice and warm with a thick coat and some boots. I knew Beelzebaby would insist on sitting outside on the deck to enjoy the view and I didn’t want to be cold all night.

&amp;#x200B;

I was right. We got to the lodge and she made a beeline for an outside table. We sit down, gab some menus and order our drinks. Five minutes in Beelzebaby asks if I’m cold, cause I keep blowing my nose. I tell her its just allergies (from sharing space with her and her terrible perfume) and I point out that I’m dressed nice and warm. A few minutes later Beelzebaby insists that DH must be cold. He tells her he isn’t. Some CBF ensues. A minute after that she insists that I must be cold and tells us we have to move tables.

&amp;#x200B;

DH and I are tired of her shit and we decide to move just so she’ll shut the hell up. We move to a table near the bar which is right between two open doors, so a really chilly breeze is passing over us. Its twice as cold as outside. It’s a six seeter table so I choose a nice seat. I have to move almost immediately cause I end up being down wind from Beelzebaby and her perfume is so bad I can barely breath. I move to the seat opposite her. I’m much closer to her, but at least her perfume is being blown the other way. I’d been seated less than a minute when she jumps up and moves to the seat furthest from me, claiming the wind was bothering her. (DH did a full eye roll).

&amp;#x200B;

Two minutes after being seated and Beelzebbay wants to know the specials. Instead of asking the waiter who delivered our drinks, she rushes outside to read them off a board. A few minutes after that she’s in the waiters face demanding he close all the doors cause she’s cold. He didn’t cave and she made Fil do it, insisting that I was cold. A few minutes after that she leaps out of her chair again to harass the bartender. She wants him to make her a fire in the fireplace. In fact she demands it. He politely tells her no. She runs back to our table fuming.

&amp;#x200B;

Then after a few sips of our drinks, she demands that we move tables, again. She wants to sit in the main dining area cause it’s closer to the kitchens and she doesn’t want her food to get cold. Apparently her food will become stone cold if she needs to wait an extra ten seconds for it. I finally put my foot down and tell her we are not moving again. Epic CBF.

&amp;#x200B;

When she finally graces us with small talk again, its to dictate to Fil what he should eat. Apparently Fil doesn’t like chicken. He also doesn’t like fish. He should have steak. He likes steak. He can’t be happy with anything but steak. Fil gets fish. I’m sure he did it to piss her off. More CBF. She ends up trying to tell DH and I what to order. DH literally laughed in her face when she told him he can’t have desert cause he has to eat the ice cream she has at home. 

&amp;#x200B;

Highlights of our dinnertime conversation. She stuck her phone under our noses to show us photos of some random woman’s baby. It looked like a droopy eyed basset hound and I plainly told her so. She shrieked at me for being rude. Dh laughed and told her that it's ugly kids like that that makes him thankful we aren’t having any kids. Beelzebaby looked like she was smelling shit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Beelzebaby had a meltdown cause our topics for conversation were too depressing. We were discussing the laws surrounding compassionate leave (DH’s co-worker just had a loss in the family). We changed the subject to weddings and she and Fil made some loud racist remarks. Dh and I quickly changed subjects again to work, which she turned into an awkward discussion about my lack of a full time job. Thank god the food arrived cause it gave her a chance to criticize something else.

&amp;#x200B;

Dh and I wolved our food down, we were so over it. Well, the bill arrives and Beelzebaby insists on paying. She even looks smug at winning the right to pay. If only paying was that easy. She and Fil ended up having a loud argument about how much to tip, which ended up in Fil stiffing the poor waiter and Beelzebaby refusing to talk to him cause he made her look cheap. A decent human being would have cared more about not giving a waiter a fair tip.  DH and I will never be able to go back there. All the staff and some guests heard their yelling.

&amp;#x200B;

We get home after some long silences and a freezing ride home. I kept the windows down so I didn’t have to smell Beelzebaby. I don’t give a shit if she freezes. I like breathing.

&amp;#x200B;

We get home and Beelzebaby insists we watch her favorite show with her and have her cheap ice cream desert. Her favorite show is a telenovela, translated into Dutch with English subtitles. I stood there for two minutes watching that shit show before laughing out loud and telling her I was going to bed. Goooooodnight. She was pissed, but life is too short to watch shit like that or to put up with more of her nonsense.

&amp;#x200B;

Dh lasted 15 min with the awful show before he literally fled to our room. It was half past seven and he literally couldn’t stand another second of his mother's presence. He had a long rant about her. The short version is: That was the worst dinner he's ever had. I fully agree.

"Background: I've (23) been dating my boyfriend (29, FDH) for 9 months. I've never met anyone I've clicked so perfectly with, and we have both said we think we are soulmates, and have had serious discussions about spending the rest of our lives together. We had been planning on moving in together this summer but that was stopped by his mother (FMIL). 

We live in the UK, FMIL lives in her home country, Malaysia (she speaks very good English). She owns the flat he lives in in the UK. He is her only child, and FFIL passed away several years ago (he was \~25\~ years her senior).

The FMIL: I have only met FMIL once, last month when she came for her yearly visit (she uses the flat as a base to go travelling in Europe for several months a year). I tried my best to be the sweetest, most charming version of myself possible. She didn't acknowledge me for the first hour, and remained almost silent for the rest of the evening. FDH was quite affectionate with me in front of her (arm around me, occasional touching, having our 'silent conversations') which surprised me but I think was to show how much he cared. I think this might have shocked her.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, FDH told FMIL that he wants me to move in. She basically lost her shit and said no girlfriend of his would ever be allowed to live there (although she was okay with us living together as long as it wasn't her flat). When he said he would move out of the flat to live with me in rented accommodation, she changed her tune and said I could live there when we had been together for longer, but refused to give a time frame: ""what will be will be"". (I've expanded on this in a previous post to r/relationshipadvice).

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, FMIL has expressed the desire to come and live in the UK (she never wanted this before), has said she might come back in August (she left last week) rather than wait til next year, and started talking to/meeting men from the UK on dating apps.

When she is here, she sleeps in FDH's bed, making him stay on the sofa, and seems to be doing everything possible to stop him seeing me. If FDH and I make plans to hang out in the evening, she will tell him that she is cooking dinner so he can't come see me, or he needs to take her shopping, or some excuse. If they spend the day out and FDH suggests inviting me, he is shot down.

&amp;#x200B;

FDH has told me that FMIL is not encouraging our relationship as she does not see it as practical. She thinks he is too young to settle down.

Apparently she is really into Chinese Numerology and was pleased when my numbers showed that I was very independent as her worst fear is her son being with someone who is completely dependent on him. 

She's going to consult her family medium about me some time this week, yay.

&amp;#x200B;

What concerns me is that FDH has said several times that 'mum will always be my number 1 woman, she will always come first'. I said I understood that (my JYmum is my best friend and literal angel) as we haven't been together that long but at some point in life your partner should become your first priority. He went 'well, yeah' kind of quietly. I get that their culture is different and the parents are pretty much worshiped but I don't want to be carrying his children and him still telling me she's his priority. On that note, I have PCOS and fertility issues, and she's said she is skeptical and doesn't believe that. Okay...

&amp;#x200B;

Now, they have decided to sell the flat and buy a house, but as houses are more expensive, they have decided that FDH will get a mortgage for whatever the sale of the flat doesn't cover. This concerns me as they are LITERALLY BUYING A HOUSE TOGETHER and he thinks this is a great idea. 

When it comes to FMIL, FDH doesn't seem to have a spine at all, it's 'what she says goes'. When I asked if he liked her as a person he said 'she is my mother'. We've had so many conversations about her, I don't want him to think I'm the bad guy here, I know he feels like he's pulled between us and I never want him to feel like he has to choose between us. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry this has been so long. I'm just feeling insecure, I don't want to break up with him, he's absolutely the love of my life. Need some advice.

Edit: Thank you all for taking the time to reply. I have read every single one. I'm not responding to most as I am quite emotional right now as I figure out my next steps. I am going to speak to him tonight, possibly show him this post and the comments, and go from there.

"Okay so I made a post here a few weeks ago which I will link in the comments, but this is an update

So after I walked out my fiance asked if I would be willing to go back and talk to her. I said yes, as long as we start looking for places, and she agrees to listen.
I went back and she just pretended like nothing happened, so I left it.
She had her moments where she would start yelling again, about something miniscule like us not watching TV with her, even though we did, or not cleaning up, which we did. But we just dealt with it, and started trying to deal with our lives.
Seeing as we were supposed to get married, but postponed it we decided that the day the wedding was supposed to be would now be an engagement party for those who had already booked flights, or taken time of work etc.

My fiance told me none of his family wanted to come, everytime someone, including myself, asked him who was coming.
We just got back from what was supposed to be our honeymoon today and she asked us to sit down so she could talk to us, so we did. 
She then accused me of disrespecting her, and treating her like nothing as I didn't invite her. I stated that I had been told she was invited, but didn't want to come, and my fiance said the same thing to her multiple times, but she walked away and outright refused to listen to anything we had to say.
She then told me that she didn't want me in the house, due to me disrespecting her.
So I am back to square one, being stuck in my mother's house, with $9 to my name, and no job.
I am so exhausted of always feeling like I am hated by my MIL. I wanted to move out, and we were saving, and looking at where to go. I had been to two different job interviews this week alone and I still feel like I've gotten nowhere

"This really ticked me off last night and I’m still having trouble with it. For background, I live with my JNM since going back to school, but hardly see her, and my little brother who is 15.

My JNM is taking my little brother (15M) with her to a big city with her boyfriend to spend the weekend with his family.

JNM’s boyfriend isn’t a bad person. I’ve only been around him a couple times since they’ve been dating, they’ve been together for 2 years. He only comes down to stay with us when my brother is at our dad’s house, and only once a month which I’m fine with. Doesn’t bother me that he’s there. He lives 2+ hours away so it makes sense that he stays the night. Sometimes JNM will also travel to him and stay there. JNM is verrrrrry particular that my little brother is never, ever around when her boyfriend stays the night and even forbids my significant other from staying the night (I’m a 27 year old woman, but it’s her house so whatever. It doesn’t bother me) even when my little brother isn’t there.

My problem is that on this trip JNM and her boyfriend will be staying in the same room with my brother. Now while my brother will have his own bed, JNM and her boyfriend will be in the same bed right next to his. 

I think this is extremely inappropriate for several reasons and overstepping boundaries. One being that I would be uncomfortable in the position and would refuse and my brother has already protested that he doesn’t feel comfortable being put in that situation, but JNM doesn’t care and just states “You don’t like to do anything ever.”  My little brother mostly protests because he says he doesn’t know her boyfriend and doesn’t feel comfortable sleeping in a bed right next to him. Also it seems creepy. My brother has seen her boyfriend only 3 times before and never spent more than an hour with him and usually only with me and our other brother as like a family dinner.

I told JNM very gently that I think it is a bad idea and I wouldn’t even feel comfortable in that situation. I asked if there is any way that they can possibly get 2 hotel rooms. She replied, “Maybe, that’s just how it is right now. He doesn’t ever want to do anything anyway.”

I know that I can be pretty protective over my brothers, especially my youngest brother because he is 12 years younger than me and I raised him for most of his childhood. While my parents were...I don’t really know where they were, I was just left with him for most of his life. (I was homeschooled) I’m trying really hard not to be the parent but I really do think this is wrong. Another issue is that my brother still sleeps with JNM in her bed and I’ve tried to talk to both of them about it because it’s strange and I don’t think it’s healthy. He’ll fall asleep in his bed and get into her bed in the middle of the night. JNM has states SEVERAL times that my brother is “the only husband I’ll ever need” and that she misses him when he’s not sleeping in the bed with her. Am I overreacting? Or am I overstepping boundaries? Is she overstepping boundaries? I want to protect BRO and make his life better than mine was, but I don’t know how.

UPDATE: Just talked to JNM and she agreed to get a 2nd room at the hotel. I will be addressing the sleeping in the same bed problem with our father in the near future.",JUSTNOMIL
"So I called JNmum today as my bro owes me money and she's holding it so he doesn't blow it all on weed. She said she asked my bro to ask my sis to transfer it to me. Gist of the conversation.
Me: why didn't you ask sis directly?
Mum: she isn't talking to me
Me: why?
Mum: she says the most horrid things to me 
Me: like what?
Mum: starts crying, I don't want to say
Me: come on tell me 
Mum: I'm on anti depressants and can't remember what she said that upset me 

Then why are you crying?
Mum had a tendency to make my sister the villain. I messaged my sister and told her of our conversation, not accusing her but just so she knows what mum said, as per our pact to tell each other anything mum says to us about the other. Sis says she hasn't talked to mum in nearly two months, as the last time they spoke mum went crazy and wailing like someone had died and started smashing plates. So now they live in the same house and just don't chat.",JUSTNOMIL
"This has been happening over the past few months and I’ve decided to make a post about it since I think she’s reached the peak of this phase of hers. To summarize who Face-Book is however, here’s a few simple guidelines that will illustrate her in the best light possible.

Racist woman who tried to make me talk when I’m mute, tried to get me to reject my husband after he proposed, tried to plan our wedding, tried to ruin the wedding, tried to kidnap my husband. I emphasize tried, because she’s an idiot through and through and tends to fa. She’s Face-Book because I can harness my inner Japanese to shuriken journals into her face.

Yeah, I’ll get on with the story.

Now I’m not sure how many facebook videos she’s been watching but this woman is on a fucking streak in flooding her family with things about goddamn babies. Babies this, kids that, toddler tuesday, about to summon a small demon for herself through sheer willpower. Anyways, DH is the only one in his family of age to have a child, if you could even say mid 20s is remotely of age to willingly take on that responsibility.

So FB is pushing for DH to have a kid! Honestly, a little DH running around would be cute as hell, and maybe a couple years down the line, but there’s a couple issues with that. What might these issues be? Here’s a brief transcription between DH and FB, as he so kindly provided me (taken off his desk at night) with his phone for the purposes of this. Tell me if you can spot them.


Face-Book: HI DH

DH: hi mom

Face-Book: HRU!!!

DH: good

Face-Book: *link to baby post*

DH: thats cute

Face-Book: IKR??? When are you going to give me babies DH?????

DH: we’re not planning anytime soon

Face-Book: WHY NOT???

DH: because we just aren’t

Face-Book: I won’t be around forever!!!! You better hurry!!! (Emojis)

DH: im in no rush

Face-Book: PLEASEEEEEEEE?

DH ignores her for a couple hours, until she texts again.

FB: OMG DH MAYBE YOU COULD TRY WITH (girl he knew from elementary) SHES SO PRETTY NOW LOOK (facebook link)

DH: what?

FB: BABIES!!!!!!

DH: im not having kids with some stranger

FB: SHES NOT A STRANGER SHES BASICALLY FAMILY

DH: that doesn’t fix it

FB: u two would be so cute together though!!!

DH: Oh well

FB: DH pLEASE i just want one grandbabyyyyyyyyyy (emojis)

DH: even if i do it wont be with her

FB: WHY NOT

DH: IM FUCKING MARRIED

FB: WHY DO YOU HATE ME DH
FB: IM JUST TRYING TO BE A GRANDPARENT BEFORE I DIE
FB: IM TELLING YOUR FATHER ABOUT THIS TOO
FB: YOURE BREAKING OUR HEARTS BEING WITH HER
FB: SHES LYING TO YOU
FB: THAT WOMAN IS TURNING YOU AGAINST US

DH: im blocking your number see you next month

I’m down for that, until FB starts texting from his dad’s phone

FB: im not going to stop until i get little DHs!!!!! (emojis)

DH: not happening, blocking you too dad, sorry

FB: ill do everything for it please!! I just want one grandbaby!!!

DH: no

FB: youre not little anymore and since youve been with this girl youve been nothing but mean!!
FB: i just want my son back
FB: and starting a real family is a good way to fix everything

He blocked her again. The month is up the first of June and she hasn’t made any other attempts to bully us.


I, personally, reading this, got pretty mad. This woman just implied me, DH, 2 street cats who sometimes come inside, and that raccoon who once slept in my recliner and now lives in our backyard isn’t a family? The fucking nerve. But apart from our assortment of wild creatures, what the hell are we meant to do at this rate? DH doesn’t want to go fully NC but FB is stretching her inch of rope as far as it can around us and it’s hard to breathe.",JUSTNOMIL
"\*Reposting here from relationships after finding out about this subreddit from there.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been with my fiance for 4 years. We started out as a long distance relationship (I was working in his state for the summer) and closed the distance about 2 years ago when we moved across the country together. We were both on the east coast (1000 miles apart in the states we lived in) and moved to the west coast. We rarely fight and this is the biggest problem in our relationship...

&amp;#x200B;

At the start of our relationship, I was so nervous about his family liking me. I saw his family several times and spent some holidays with them. During this time, his mom would:

\- Constantly ask him if I forced him to do things (example: try new food, drive, watch horror movies, go on trips)

\- Ask him who drove and when he would say he did, she would get very upset that I didn't drive. I have a fear of driving due to an accident where my axle broke on the highway and I don't like to drive. My fiance doesn't mind driving and always drives us when we go somewhere together.

\- When we were moving to the west coast together, she got extremely upset and asked him many times in front of me if I was forcing him to move, if he actually wanted to move, etc.

\- Force us to take pictures when we are both uncomfortable with pictures and then send them to her big family chat of 30+ people

\- Traveling is one of my favorite things to do and before he met me, he didn't do much but play games. Now he loves traveling too and she is upset that when he was younger, he didn't want to do those things with her. She demands he calls her as soon as he gets back from trips (which he has now stopped doing) and then says negative things about our trip as he's telling her about it, and brings up how when he was younger she couldn't get him to go on family trips happily.

\- Ask all the time if he does all the chores/cooking and if I do nothing

&amp;#x200B;

At first I wanted so badly for her to like me that I didn't even think about how he didn't really stick up for me or assert himself when she would ask these questions. I asked him to show more enthusiasm about moving out west because he's often stoic. It's just his personality to not show much excitement about anything. Looking back on this, I wish that he had said something to her about her constantly asking if I am forcing him to move out west. He also wishes he stuck up for me sooner, but he didn't notice any of this until I pointed it out to him. I didn't point it out to him for awhile because I was worried about telling him that I didn't like his mom due to these reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

When she came to visit us on the west coast, she kept calling us cheap. She called us cheap because we shop at Costco and she called my fiance cheap when a restaurant we were eating at offered him more rice and he said yes so that he could take his leftovers back and have them for lunch the next day... She told us that we live in a nice state, but that tech is like the coal industry and this place was going to be a slum in 10 years. She also said it was bad to have a lot of money and she got upset when my fiance got a job on the west coast. His previous company let him work remotely until he found a job here. She was hoping that he wouldn't be able to get a job and would have to move back to the east coast. Whenever he had an interview, she would be happy if it didn't go successfully.

&amp;#x200B;

This past September we went on a 3 week trip to Europe and stayed with my fiance's grandparents in one of the countries that we were visiting since they live there. She flew from the east coast to meet us there even though we were only there for 3 nights in that town with the grandparents. In that time, she kept calling us ""Japanese tourists"" and saying our trip was rushed and that we just take pictures of places and then leave, which is very untrue. She also kept asking about our travel plans in some of the other countries, and then getting upset about our plans and making rude comments. My fiance thinks that it's because she's jealous since she always goes back to the same places and then just goes to the beach. This was pretty much the point where things ***changed***. She calls every week, and he decided he didn't want to talk to her that often anymore. Especially since the phone calls increase my anxiety due to her judging me/us all the time. She asked him to call her back as soon as he got back from the trip to which he ignored. When he finally did call her back, he told her that she was rude when we saw her in Europe with the whole ""Japanese tourist"" comments, etc. She apologized, but made excuses saying that it was actually her brothers saying that when that wasn't true at all...

&amp;#x200B;

My fiance started ignoring her weekly calls and she wrote dramatic text messages that she could die and he would never know. He told her to stop being dramatic and that she wasn't going to die. All she wrote back was ""Oh so now you're mad? It was a joke."" He answers the phone once a month now, sometimes goes even longer. It's stressful to us because she writes dramatic texts, continuously texts demanding him to call her when he ignores her calls, and then when he does answer once a month, she lectures him on not calling and demands that he calls her more frequently and declares that they will have a call the next week. He doesn't comply with what she says anymore, but he's not super assertive.

&amp;#x200B;

We recently bought a house together in April and she was not happy because she was hoping that he would move back to the east coast. I should also mention that he has 2 brothers (1 younger and 1 older) that both live near her, so it's not like he's their only child. His younger brother lives 2 hours away and comes home to her every weekend and his older brother is about 5 hours away and she visits him a few times a month. She said she wanted to come visit us in June, but my fiance told her that month isn't good for us because we are still getting set up and doing some housework that we want to get done before having people over. She said that didn't matter and stated that there was no way that whatever we wanted to get done would take that long. She started to negotiate for time off at her work to come in June, but they didn't have any openings for her to take off. So then she asked if she could come in May. He told her no and that we were going to be out of the state at the time she wanted to come because we had a trip planned from before we got the house. He mentioned through text that he already told her that June was bad. She wrote back ""No need to get all huffy"" and requested all of our travel plans for the entire year, which he did not give her.

&amp;#x200B;

My fiance is at the point where he never wants to speak to her again and wants to block her. He tends to ignore a lot of her texts now and leaves them unread on WhatsApp, but recently she started texting me to ask about him, which makes me feel awkward. I told him not to block her because then it would mean cutting his dad off too.. His dad is also a very quiet person and usually doesn't say much on the phone calls. His mom and dad share a phone number and email address, so there is no way to contact him separately from her. I feel so bad about all of this because he never had a problem with her until I came along. He told me it's not my fault, but if he cuts her off, I feel like it will be my fault for not handling my anxiety better around her. I just feel so scared of her and afraid of her knowing too much about our lives.

&amp;#x200B;

I talked to his sister in law a little bit about all of this and she has experienced the same sort of problems. His mom even accused his SIL of cheating on his brother. His SIL told me that her husband never learned how to communicate like an adult to his mom and that's probably why there are issues with this and now they are getting a divorce. I kind of feel that same way about my fiance, but at least he no longer gives into what his mom says anymore and will say no. However, he is not very assertive about it and she is still pushy and doesn't respect boundaries at all.

&amp;#x200B;

We actually haven't even told his parents that we are engaged because we want to elope and his mom wants a wedding. She was very upset that her older son eloped with his wife. I did not want to deal with her pressure or her trying to guilt us to have a wedding, so I asked my fiance not to tell his family that he had proposed. We have kept this a secret for over a year now and plan to elope next year.

&amp;#x200B;

I really need advice on how to deal with this. I've been telling my fiance that he shouldn't block her because he might regret it if she or his dad does die, but it's at the point where he hates even talking to her now. He also plans to block her without giving her a reason... I think he at least needs to tell her why, but he doesn't want to. I just feel so bad about everything and wish it wasn't like this. I told him that he should be more assertive to her and maybe things would be fine, but he has trouble being very assertive when she's pushing him to do something. Instead, he won't say anything and then will do the opposite of what she says. I know that actions supposedly speak louder than words, but I feel like she needs words and he should stand up more firmly to her..

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Future MIL is pushy and doesn't respect boundaries. She constantly asks if I force my fiance to do things. Fiance wants to cut her off, but I am worried that this is not a good idea and she will start contacting me or blaming me. Need advice on how to move forward.",JUSTNOMIL
"Long time lurker, this post is about my JNMom (77).  Located in the US.  Please advise if better suited to JNoFamily.  Thanks.

**TL:DR:  JNMom won’t help herself, prefers to play the victim card.  GCYB and SIL will likely take every dime and dump her on a new doorstep when she’s broke.  Do I lawyer up to try and nip this in the bud?**  

Kind internet strangers, I am struggling with what I believe is an escalating situation with JNMom.  Attempting brevity, though hard to condense; somewhat vague as several family members are also on reddit and the specific details are very identifying.

JNMom and E/JYDad hoard.  Everything.  Dad passed in December after a short illness and we are realizing just how much he shielded us (Me (OD), MS, MB, GCYB) from her crazy.  So yes, we are mourning the loss of our father and some of us, the loss of the mother we deserved but didn’t get.

Due to the hoard JNMom is unable to locate fully executed Will &amp; Trust documents.  Probate has begun.  And a HUGE shout out to this sub as I grey rocked through the first hearing like a pro.  Seriously, JNMom, you ghosted me on my b-day and you want to know how I’m doing?  Yes, still a little salty about that one.

JNMom has cleaved/superglued to GCYB as her advisor, therapist, and counsel (Sonsband if you prefer).  He has a good heart but no financial strengths (think – an interest only mortgage is a GOOD thing), and he and his current wife have borrowed tens of thousands from JNMom.  Conservative estimate is over $100K USD. He is her baby, her darling and SIL has her eye on what she sees as “their” rightful inheritance, no matter the cost – familial and financial.

Any conversations that involve encouragement to JNMom for therapy are met with a brick wall.  She doesn’t have a problem – WE are the ones with problems.  FWIW, three of her offspring are in therapy to process all that has taken place since dad’s passing.

Over the years, multiple attempts have been made to assist with getting financials sorted (they haven’t filed their tax returns in many years-they have sufficient income that this is necessary even at their age), clear the hoard, and get them into a safe and manageable living situation (house has a bad roof, sketchy foundation, and (ICK) mice, lots of mice).  Any and all attempts resulted in JNMom losing her ever-loving stuffing and either storming out of the house or demanding those present depart immediately.

MS, MB and I do NOT want or need anything financial from JNMom.  We only want her to be secure in her remaining years.  Her own mother lived to 97 so it is likely that we are looking at 20+ years to plan for.  JNMom is in good physical health and when probate is settled there should (based on today’s financials) be plenty to sustain a comfortable life that would include travel on a limited basis.

I know GCYB and SIL well.  They will most likely bankrupt JNMom within five years of probate being settled and then come to the rest of us for help/money when the burden falls to them.  The reasons I expect they will spend every dime are: three minor children heading to college in the next 2-3 years and one child who is getting married.  JNMom can’t/won’t say no to any requests to “help” fund these activities.

To be transparent, JNMom has helped many (6) of her grandchildren (9 total) in times of need – within reason and for good cause (bridging tuition, custody action for a child) and was glad to be able to help.  She set aside an equal share for each and some have received theirs and they are grateful and have no expectation (all above the age of majority now and living adult lives) of future disbursements. 

This is my situation:  I have the means to secure independent legal representation to initiate an action to request an independent financial administrator for JNMom; limited duration until ALL her arrangements are locked down.  I don’t want that rep to be me, I believe a third party would be more objective.  My therapist and I have gone around and around on this.  Logically, I know it is JNMom’s path and she will do what she wants.  Based on what we have learned and observed throughout our lives, I have a very low expectation of success.  **Please don’t suggest that we involve APS – IATA, but not THAT A.**  Not today, anyway.",JUSTNOMIL
"_UPDATE_  MIL just emailed me with Niece's color.  I was 99% sure I got it right, and I did.  Thanks one and all for advice.  I learned a big lesson.


Ok.  Dear Hubby's family is wealthy and living the dream.  Perfect manners, beautiful houses, got ALL their shit together.  

DH and I?  We're happy, well-mannered, but poor. We live paycheck to paycheck, you understand, yes?  There's nothing wrong with living within your means.  Or, for splurging when you can.

So my Niece and her husband forked out a TON of money to buy us plane tickets to come and visit.   Had a fantastic time.  Museums, delicate dining, I drank out their entire bar, had a fantastic and lovely time.

Now it is the time for the Ritual of the Giving of Gifts.  For Thank You.  My niece has expensive tastes.  Waterford crystal, shops at Louis Vuitton, reserve wines, etc.

We bonded in her kitchen over Le Creuset and cast iron (of which I know quite a bit).  She mentioned she wanted a specific piece.  I noted her color.  I plotted and schemed for Thank You gift.

I looked over the website.  I can afford this with my end-of-semester bonus. 

I stupidly emailed my MIL for her color as Le Creuset has about 6 different shades of my Niece's color.  MIL states too expensive for YOU to afford.  

I shined up my spine and said this is what I want to do.  It is what I'm GOING to do.  What's her color?

The Invisible Therapist on my shoulder is clapping her hands.  Can I get an AMEN?

Now I wait with baited breath for the inevitable email storm.  I will update when the shit show is over.

"Hi so I usually don’t post anonymously but for my own safety I think I should so this is a throwaway account. I’m asking for advice from anyone who works with CPS or has been in a similar situation where they’d have advice for me. 
My FMIL is batshit crazy. She has crossed so many boundaries and she’s all around the most manipulative person I’ve ever met. Well I’m almost 7 months pregnant and she has several younger kids who still live with her. Well recently some events occurred that I won’t go too into detail on in order to stay as anonymous as possible but basically my FBIL sexually harassed me while living with FH and I and we ended up kicking him out. Well after that FMIL was going nuts and constantly coming at us. She claimed to understand why we couldn’t live with him but she still persisted with the harassment. We were no contact for a little bit but with trying to keep a relationship with FH’s siblings that were young and still lived with her that was difficult and we decided to tell her that while I needed some space we are open to plan a time to get together and talk through things. That never happened but tonight was his little sisters sports awards and she asked if we could stop by their house on the way home to see the siblings that didn’t come. Well we agreed however my FH said he’d go inside and grab them to come outside so I didn’t have to come inside and see the brother that sexually harassed me. Well while we are all outside chatting the FMIL runs out and is actually charging at me and I’m afraid that if my FH didn’t put me behind him that she would’ve physically assaulted me. The obvious point that I’m very pregnant nor the toddlers standing between us stopped her. 
After around 20-30 minutes of verbal abuse from her calling me a gold digger among other nice things (still in front of all the kids) she also said she was going to kill herself. This is also because she didn’t get an invite to the babyshower that my friend threw me btw. The kids are all having breakdowns in the front lawn and FH and I are trying to calm them down. The kids tell us she says things like this consistently (all these kids are between 3-18 years old) and that she is usually very “snappy and at their throats like this” over the situation. After leaving and then pulling over on the side of the road for FH and I to have our own breakdowns as we were desperately trying to hold it together in front of the kids, we knew we had to do something. The kids obviously were not okay and whether that threat was serious or just to manipulate us something should be done. We got home and decided we were going to be strict NC with her and blocked her on Facebook (because she was also threatening to harass my friends and family which is something she’s done in the past and she finds them through Facebook) and we think that we want to call CPS tomorrow morning after the kids go to school and report that she was blatantly threatening suicide in front of the children and although she has a history of being manipulative and we don’t think this is serious, it’s seriously effecting the kids and she needs at least some kind of mental help regardless. There aren’t any relatives that would take the kids if they were to be taken away and unfortunately we can’t because we don’t have the space to even legally accommodate that many kids if we wanted to but we are worried they will be thrown into the system and split up. With some of them being so young especially this is pretty scary. We really don’t know what to do and what’s best and frankly my fiancé is terrified as am I. We really need some options here. 
Also, after we make the call we want to look into how we could get a temporary restraining order against her however we will still want to see the kids so make sure it’s allowed that we can meet up in a public place to see them and that any contact has to be strictly about the kids. We aren’t 100% sure how this would work but we want that to be a thing for a least a few months after the baby is born because we know once we have our baby she’s gonna get worse. We’d like to have that until we know she’s received mental help. If anyone knows anything about that and about how we would even go about doing that we would greatly appreciate it.
Edited to add:
Also we will be looking into some kind of couples counseling to navigate through this.",JUSTNOMIL
"Long time lurker, first time to post.  Short back story, I’ve been divorced from my boy’s sperm donor for 13 years and remarried 4 years ago.  

His bat shit cray cray parents took me to court for 4 years straight, and were eventually awarded every second Saturday of the month from 11am-7pm.  Since the boys are older, I went NC with them and let the boys make arrangements with them.  They did not show up to pick my youngest (14 y) up for their May visit.  No worries here, he hates going.  

The bat-shit cray cray ex in-laws pulled up to the house this morning at 7:15am.  They don’t come to the door for fear that I’ll blow a hole through their stomachs with one of my DH’s shotguns through the door.  Their words, not mine.  DH and I just happened to be going to the big city south of us today, and we were taking my son to school.  

I walk out there at 7:40 and ask “What’s up?”  It’s the first time I’ve talked to these doinks for YEARS.  They say that they are here to pick DS up.  I ask DS if he knew about this at all, he says no.  I tell them “DS has school today, he gets done June 6”.  She screeeeeeeeeeeeches JUNE 6????   Me, “Yes, June 6.”

Her smart as a rock husband says well we have texts saying to be here.  I asked to see them.  Here’s the kicker:

THEY WERE TEXTING THEMSELVES.  

DS never got any texts, never made any plans with them, and did NOT tell them to show up at 7:15 am today.  All those texts were them texting someone, but not DS, and they were replying to themselves.  There were no replies on the left side of the screen.  Just original texts on the right.  Oh, and they threatened him with court if he didn’t answer.  This is frequent.  

Why do I still have to deal with these idiots??!!

Thanks for listening!  Lots more backstory if anyone is interested.  I have great stories of their sheer dipshittedness.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi everyone!

TL;DR: both parents super religious. Don’t want anything like I’ve read about in-laws being terrible to future kids for not being religious, or to eventually ask children to lie about religion to their grandparents. Basically want to isolate them from their grandparents’ religious fanaticism. Any advice?

IL: collectively, in-laws

Hope I’ve come to the right place for this, and I expect some of you may be familiar with problems such as these so I’d love any valuable input I can get.

My partner and I both are not religions at all, but ILs are the type who would quite likely kill us (or at least entirely disown us) and make life hell for our younger siblings if we came out or if they found out we’ve been cohabiting and the rest of it (currently all they know is that we like each other, religious marriage pending).

Doesn’t help that my parents nosy already and will most likely continue to be so in the future as well. Judging from how they are with my nieces and nephews, they definitely bring religion up softly and casually mention it to kids. The one thing that worries us about the future is how ILs would interact with our children.

We don’t want ILs creeping children out about religion and hellfire and the rest, as they will most likely presume we are religious and so are the kids (while they likely won’t be and neither are we), and we also don’t want to ask our children to lie about religion or any of it. Both of us had a bad time with it and want to isolate our kids from it as much as possible.

And again, being completely honest about it is not an option as that would have terrible consequences for our younger siblings who are not yet independent or moved out.

Keeping all this in mind - especially the religious parents point, from your collective experiences, what’s the best way to deal with it? What’s a good angle to approach it with?

For now we’ve already moved away and live independently, contacting them fairly infrequently. But there’s not been a line in the sand yet, which we don’t want to draw for the siblings reason mentioned above.

Thanks in advance for all the help.",JUSTNOMIL
"Spoiler alert for anyone who wants to keep score: Sparky is winning and my patience is dying.

Sparky had to have a second shoulder surgery. She's blaming most of the damage on when she went to Walmart and got bumped hard by someone. Which, yes, did cause a fair bit of damage, but she caused just as much by not listening to doctors orders. 

So she needs 24/7 care AGAIN. She had her surgery last week, got out of the hospital for not even one full day, and then had to go back and just got out Monday. She had to go back to the hospital for shortness of breath. We all were worried about the worst. Her smoking finally catching up to her and she has COPD and this is the beginning of the end. COPD is what caused FIL to need a lung transplant. The transplant went into chronic rejection after a few years and he passed. And he stopped all tobacco cold turkey as soon as he was told to. Sparky doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell to ever stop smoking. She ""tries"" at least once every six months. It's her crutch, along with food.

NOPE. She was constipated, and it was bad enough that it was pushing up on her diaphragm, which made the bottom of one of her lungs deflate. The doctor told her before the FIRST surgery that constipation will happen due to her meds, and take a stool softener every day, and a laxative if she isn't pooping once a day, because then the stool softener isn't working. She was taking a homeopathic stool softener that didn't fucking work and didn't take a laxative. Her reasoning was that she didn't want anything too harsh because she was having to have help in the bathroom. 

That's not even what's killing my patience. That's a small drop in the bucket of my rage right now.

Sparky needs 24 hour care right now, after her second surgery. I already stated that but I'm making sure for emphasis. The same bullshit problems as last time are rolling out. This week, three of the four eldest nieces stayed with her Monday through Thursday morning to take care of her so SIL1 could work. I'm proud of them but annoyed with my in-laws.

Today at like noon, SIL1 texts to ask if anyone can stay with Sparky from 8am to 4pm on Saturday and 2-6 on Sunday. She does this because she wants to go to garage sales. SIL4 responds that they can do Sunday, but not Saturday because they're busy preparing for stuff they have planned next week/week after. Valid reasoning, not mad. I didn't see that til I woke up from my overnight shift. 

A bit later, Sparky texts about Saturday to myself, DH, SIL5, and her husband. SIL5 says that they can do it and move their regular visiting day to Saturday instead of Sunday. Because we all have regular visiting days so Sparky doesn't get lonely. Doesn't matter that SIL1 lives with her, or that DH is basically (for now) at her beck and call. 

Then SIL5 sends in the text from SIL1 that she will do Saturday, just confirming with everyone. An hour later, SIL1s cunt ass (sorry for anyone who doesn't like the c word but it's the only thing that fits) sends a nasty text to the SAME group text saying ""If no one can come Saturday,  Mom will just go with me."" Doctor's orders are that Sparky can't be in the car except for to go to doctors appointments and emergencies. We all know that damn well. SIL5, in a bout of shiny spine, says ""I just texted an hour ago saying I'll come saturday"" 

Not even 15 minutes later, Sparky sends me, DH, and SILs 2-5 this pity party bullshit text: 
""I would like to know what the deal is bout staying with me?!?!?    Am I really that much trouble??   I know everyone works and has their lives, but I don't ask for a whole lot. I feel like y'all think that "" [Sil1s name] is there, why do I need to be?""   I just want to be able to give her a break when she wants to do something.  She takes me to all Dr appts, gives me showers, and helps me with all my personal things, cooks/serves me food, cleans my yard and patio, etc---
which she doesn't mind, but it ALL shouldn't fall on her.  I have at least 5 more weeks of this with my shoulder and then I have my brain surgery.      Please help pull the load when at all possible, pull it as a team.  It's not just for [SIL1s name], it's for me too. 😢😊. I love y'all so so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️""

I'd almost guarantee that SIL1 whined to Sparky that SIL5 was rude to her. And not asking for a lot is bullshit. DH is basically at her beck and call. He and I have already agreed that shit is at its very end. I'm almost 37 weeks pregnant. Our daughter could be here any time now. But unfortunately for me, DH said that I couldn't respond to the text because I would just make the situation worse (he's right but fuck him), and that he would talk to his mother tomorrow.

Not asking for so much is complete crap. She needs 24 hour care. Everyone but SIL1 works full time, because SIL3 is the mother of a toddler, and that shit is over full time, even if she doesn't get paid for it.",JUSTNOMIL
"I thought I wouldn’t be posting again and felt so guilty for confiding in our little refit community, but here I am back on my bullshit again. Buckle up, bitches, it’s about to go down. Background info is on my previous post, but I’ll add more here as I see needed. I tried making dinner plans with my MIL so that we could discuss this wedding thing (she wants to get married around the same time as me which I was upset about) but she canceled and hadn’t really said much. Fast forward to this morning. My wonderful husband got up with our kiddo and did the morning routine, let me sleep in until 1 in the afternoon AND served me lunch in bed. I knew something was up because when he’s anxious he is overly nice and helpful. We’re on our way to drop me off for work when he says he has something, several things, to tell me. Firstly, a cousin (we will call him L) of his has been accused of molesting another cousins VERY young daughter. Over 5 under 8yeas old. We believe this is true because he confided in me that he has also felt inappropriately touched by L in their childhood. L has been around our daughter multiple times and always begs to watch her but I don’t allow it due to a gut feeling I’ve always had. He lives with MIL and they both live in Grandfather in laws house, and are supposed to be helping take care of him. The cousins were up here visiting grandpa when the assault took place. But that’s not all folks, then he drops on me that MIL and her boyfriend have been using meth. For awhile now. I’m absolutely livid. I had welcomed them both into my home, fed them dinner, allowed them to play with my daughter and be in her life, I’ve watched her kiss my baby on the mouth and not known that hours earlier they were smoking crystal goddamned meth. I can’t even excuse my language right now. It’s excusing me. I feel so angry and overwhelmed. I can’t even thing straight. I feel like I know what I need to do, but at the same time I really don’t. I’m just so overcome with anger right now. Please be gentle with me, Im on the edge of totally losing my shit today.",JUSTNOMIL
"I had a revelation in couples therapy that helped me better understand my feelings about JNMIL's selfish behavior when our LO had surgery...

LO had to have surgery unexpectedly when he was 6 weeks. He was admitted on a Friday afternoon and was scheduled for surgery at 7am the next day. 
We were nervous about LO's surgery and it was a very scary to see our newborn hooked up to IVs. Plus, it was almost impossible to keep LO calm bc he wasn't allowed to eat for 24 hours. JNMIL and FIL were in town visiting and offered to bring us food at the hospital. 

JNMIL and FIL arrived at the hospital around 7 and lingered in LO's room for 2+ hours. FIL tried to get JNMIL to leave, but she refused. She then insisted on holding LO. I should've put a stop to it, but I was too overwhelmed to think clearly. JNMIL picked LO up out of his hospital bed, got tangled up in his IVs, and nearly dropped him. All of the commotion caused LO's heart rate to go through the roof, which set off the monitor alarms. I was horrified. JNMIL has done a lot of things to piss me off, but this one makes my blood boil. 

Today our couple's therapist helped me recognize that this experience was traumatic for me. She's right- it happened over 4 months ago and it still makes me angry af. DH suggested I talk to his mom and tell her how traumatic it was. That's a hard no. JNMIL is a narc and so telling her that her actions caused me trauma is only going to give her more insight to exploit my weaknesses. 

JNMIL is flying in for LO's baptism next week and I truly don't know how I'm going to be in the same room with her.",JUSTNOMIL
"I just want to rant for a minute. My J?Mom and I did NOT get along at all when I was a teenager. So much so that we couldn’t be alone in a room together. With that being said she was a nurse and I would ask health related questions from time to time. 

Trigger warning for mentions of miscarriage 

At this point and time we weren’t really on speaking terms I was about 14-15 at this time. I had a dream about a fetus in a toilet because I had seen a picture in a biology book of a tiny fetus in a bubble? Sorry memory is a little fuzzy. Anyways my boyfriends sister had a miscarriage around this time so I was curious what exactly it looked and felt like. So my stupid self decided to ask my mom about it and describe the dream. We all went about our day and life was great... NOT

She has since used this instance to say that at 15 I was having sex and had a miscarriage. THIS NEVER HAPPENED. She told all her co workers, my dad, my brother, aunts, uncles etc. literally anyone that would listen to why I was such a horrible daughter and now a slut. Well let’s flash forward to a few days ago. 

She and I were in the same car going to Home Depot so I could help pick out her kitchen back splash. I was talking about the current abortion laws and throwing statistics out about miscarriages and this is the conversation that followed 

Me: so many women experience miscarriage, I can’t imagine how they feel. I’m one of the lucky ones that haven’t had to experience it. 

Mom:*stays silent for a moment 

I knew she was going to say something stupid so I quickly changed the subject before she could open her mouth

Me: so where do you want to go eat after this I’m starving. 

Mom: anywhere is fine... you know I’m not sure if you blocked this out but you did have a miscarriage when you were 15 

Me: (3..2..1 I lose my shit) THATS IT. You have been telling me this since I was 15 years old. IT NEVER FUCKING HAPPENED. It was a dream that I had and I made the mistake of asking you about it since you are a nurse and have had several yourself. It didn’t happen EVER! I’m officially old enough now to tell you that if you bring it up again I will not speak to you ever again. It’s a lie that I’ve been having to hear for almost a decade now. DROP IT! 

It felt good to finally say what’s been weighing on me for so long. She used this “miscarriage” to treat me like shit and take away everything in my room but a set of clothes and my bed for a year. All over something that never happened!",JUSTNOMIL
"Shout out to @tuna_tofu for the name!!

Short background: SO and I have been together a few years.  I became disabled while working but we continue to make it work and are pretty happy.  His mom said I’m not disabled because I went to the beach with my mom and made food for SO’s uncle &amp; cousins following the death of his aunt.  Also upset because I sat with the faaaaamily during the funeral.  

It was Memorial Day weekend here and since my previous fiancé was killed in Iraq it’s always a somber day for me (it’s not the day of his death but y’all know what I mean I’m sure).  My SO knows this and arranged with some of his friends to take me to the zoo and then to a friend’s pool since I love animals and floating around is one of the few times I’m pain free anymore.  He wanted me to have a good day and at the end of the day he upgraded his title from SO to FD(dear, always)H!  He wanted to add a note of happiness for Memorial Day and really did a good job honoring my former fiancé with everything.  I called my mom crying, he called his dad.  

Character Witless answered his dad’s phone.  FDH immediately grey rocked and asked to speak to his father and wouldn’t say what it was about.  He told his dad, and his dad was happy since FFIL loves me.  Then FFIL told Character Witless.  Cue the hysterics!  She’s sooooo heartbroken that he’s “throwing away his life” for a broken person.  Thankfully FFIL grabbed the phone back and started yelling at her while he was hanging up.  All of FDH’s aunts and uncles are excited and were made aware of CW’s antics.  

We won’t be getting married for a while for several reasons so we haven’t even thought about planning yet.  CW called Wednesday morning (two days later) asking if we had set a date yet and made sure to say we had to pick a date that doesn’t interfere with her job.   When he asked why she cared she said she figured we’d get married this year.  FDH asked why she’s so interested in us getting married quickly and apparently since I “don’t work” I should be having baaaaaabies as soon as we get married so I can “earn my keep taking care HER babies”.  We aren’t even sure my spine and nerves can tolerate pregnancy.  So now she’s bawling thinking she may never get graaaaandbaaaaabies.

So I’m a leech but apparently am just fine to be a walking incubator.  She’s gonna make me lose my Jesus y’all.",JUSTNOMIL
"MIL is Lady I/My/Me because everything is ""I want/think this because this is what MY friends told ME!"" She did not care for me and was positive I was mistreating DH. She has dementia now, and I am trying to work through my feelings because I need to support DH. These events happened 5-25 years ago.

So, six blissful months of not seeing Lady I/My/Me after my imitation of Krakatoa (she wisely stayed home / visited her other children, and had some medical stuff), I was in a pretty good place. DD had a long weekend from school and I had convinced DH that we should take the kids to two well-known amusement parks a few hours away. I was psyched!

Then the phone calls started. Lady I/My/Me and BIL#2 would be visiting GMIL, not too far from us, at that same time. D(amn)H was brainwashed into thinking that maybe we should instead spend that time with his family. I deflated. Then I became righteously angry. 

I gave in, but with the understanding we would be staying in a hotel and that we would take the kids somewhere fun. Staying inside all day in a non-child-proof house was not going to be fun for the kids - or me. I said I would take them to the zoo in that town by myself. I also knew GMIL's patience for my kids was about 20 minutes, so three straight days was going to be a VERY BAD IDEA.

So, we went. Hotels there were full due to university graduation, thus we stayed 30 minutes away. Since we lived 90 minutes away, I was not 100% happy, but at least I got a break from Lady I/My/Me. (And truly, rollercoasters vs Lady I/My/Me is no contest!)

Zoo was great, especially since Lady I/My/Me did not accompany us. Score one for me!

Then, GMIL's stove top died. For some stupid reason, it was decided that we all needed to go to the Sears in the mall so a new one could be ordered. Yes, all seven of us:

GMIL (about 85)

Lady I/My/Me (her daughter, my Hades)

BIL#2 

DH

Me

DD (age 6) 

DS (age 3)

It was a bad idea. DH decided he should supervise the kids when they headed towards the vacuum cleaner display. BIL#2 followed him. Lady I/My/Me and her mother begin to try to order the new stove top. I was looking around.

Did I mention GMIL was about 75% deaf, Lady I/My/Me was about 50%? They start basically yelling back and forth at each other. The poor clerk could not make himself understood among all of their snapping at each other. Of course I had to step in. I helped complete the order while shooting daggers from my eyes at DH.

DH did thank me later. He promised to make it up to me with a trip to those two parks in the future. 

It took seven years.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hihi, long time lurker, first time commenter. A post prompted me to give some advice about privacy on Snapchat. For those that don't know but may need it, you can block people from *viewing* your Snapchat story without un-adding them. 


Go to settings (scroll down). Under ""WHO CAN..."" you will see 'view my story'. Change your setting to 'custom' and and name you press will be given a red X next to it meaning they can no longer view your story.  Fortunately, SC doesn't notify them that they can't see your story. This will stay that way unless you go back to unblock them from viewing your story. 


You can also make private stories where you select who you're comfortable with sharing specific events/ things with. 


Of course, the con of this is having a mole that leaks info to family members but I've found it easier to find who that person is when you limit who has access to you! I do this sometimes to keep people at a distance w/o outright blocking as that can cause major drama.

"Ok so this was my first glimpse of real crazy with my mother.
I didn’t really understand/see the crazy as a child, this was my first clear vision of “OH SHIT THIS BITCH CRAY”. 

So the nickname I gave my mother was Eternal Victim, so I will be referring to her as EV through out the story.

So I was staying with my mother while I was pregnant and looking for my own apartment, I was working full time and it was all good. Then I had my baby, and EV realized she was NOT going to get unlimited time with MY baby. She kept saying things like “treat me like a husband! I’ll do whatever a husband would do with the baby!” Uhm. No. 

She started with little digs and just constantly trying to pick her up and give pushy advice. When I shut all that down (I have fairly good boundary skills) she started accusing me of not appreciating her in different ways.

“Why won’t you let me hold the baby, you’re treating me like an invalid who can’t hold a baby!” (She was a very shaky person, dropped my nephew down the the stairs a few years before this so I only let her hold baby while she was sitting down, I didn’t bring up this incident or say anything rude about it I just made sure to supervise her while holding baby, but clearly she noticed I was wary) 

She had been growing more and more agitated and throwing out more digs at me but this incident was the one where I was like I need to leave NOW.

So I did all the grocery shopping for us and we both liked the same brand of salad dressing but she liked the half fat kind and I like full fat (tastes way better to me), so I bought us each a container and wrote “turquoise pizza’s salad dressing” on the top of mine so we wouldn’t mix them up accidentally.
This ensues: 
EV: “Turquoise Pizza, why would you do this?”
Me: “Do what mom?”
EV: “claim the salad dressing like I can’t have any?”
Me: “well you can if you want, I just didn’t want them to get mixed up because they are slightly different but the bottles looked the same” 
EV: “no, no don’t worry I won’t eat any of YOUR salad dressing.”
Uhm ok.
I thought that was it, but the next morning I wake up to hysterical sobbing.

I walk out to the living room, like ok what’s wrong mom.
EV: “ I just don’t know how you could do this to me, I do everything for you!”
Me: “what?!”
EV: “you are depriving me of salad dressing!!”
Me: “mom I said you could have some!! I just didn’t want them to get mixed up! Plus there’s like 3 other kinds in the fridge like I really don’t see the problem?!”
EV: “you are just UNGRATEFUL turquoise pizza, I do everything for you so you can spend all your time with your baby!” (Not true but ok sure)
Me: “ok but I really just don’t get how I did anything wrong here...?”
EV: *continues sobbing loudly* “you won’t even let me bath the baby or change diapers” (now it comes out what it’s really about)
Me: “no I won’t and I won’t apologize for that. She is MY baby and MY responsibility and I want to bond with her and take care of her”
EV: GET OUT! 
Ok. Bye!
She gave me the silent treatment because I refused to apologize for “depriving her of salad dressing”. 
The next week I moved in with a friend until I could find an apartment. The end.",JUSTNOMIL
"An older story from about... 2011-2012. 

I was still at school and my period had just started. I think I’d left a box of tampons in the bathroom I shared with B1 and B2 at the time (at least one of them). 

I was still new to figuring things out (by years, yes, but JNSMum was new in my life at this point and JNMum didn’t really have any sort of ‘talk’ with me about lady things) and had recently decided I 100% do not like pads. 

(Kudos to you if you do wear pads. Each to their own)

I always smelt as I wasn’t really any good at personal hygiene at this point (more just starting to look after myself) and I HATED going to the toilet (which I do A LOT) and seeing any amount of blood on the pad. No matter how much was there I always felt the need to change the pad and it ended up a waste of money. Not to mention I couldn’t get them to stick comfortably... they were either in the wrong spot and I could feel it or sticking to me/pubes. Not fun. I also wasn’t very good at holding my bladder so the undies would get a bit wet and the next pad would barely stick. 

So I’d decided on tampons after trial testing them. 

They were my friend. 

Put one in, don’t worry about it for the next several hours, no matter how many times I went to the toilet. 

JNSMum was NOT a fan of tampons. 

At all. 

She told me I needed to use pads and that tampons weren’t allowed in the house. 

I didn’t care, I’d keep putting them on the shopping list. 

Then she told me she’d tell JYDad they weren’t allowed and to NEVER buy them again. 

Oh my god, she dragged JYDad into this ‘argument’. 

She then explained to JYDad all the downsides of tampons. 

Dude. I’m not going to leave a tampon in for a week (still haven’t) and die of whatever poisoning that gives you. 

Get a grip. 

By this point I was 16-18 years old. Not a baby. 

So JYDad sat down with me and I explained to him why I hated pads and that I PREFERED tampons and that JNSMum could not force me to use them. 

I feel as though I threatened to throw out all pads bought for me. I dunno. Seems like a teenage-me thing to say. 

In the end JNSMum did NOT get her way and JYDad and I had agreed that I would now be paying for my own lady hygiene products, no matter what I chose. 

Small victories in a long war. 

She also has no say whatsoever as to what I do to my own body as 1) it’s my body and 2) I no longer live with them. I’m a free bird ever since mid-2015.

Edit: one commenter (many now) posted about Toxic Shock Syndrome. That’s what JNSMum was trying to scare me with.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hello, I've posted here before about my Mom and I have a feeling i'm going to continue to need advice and people to talk to so my Mom needs a name! I'm still thinking up one that fits her but if anyone else has a suggestion gaslighting is her main issue.

My Mom gaslit me today and I was going to post about but I handled it and it won't leave scars unlike this story I remembered. About 2 years ago I had a dentist appointment and Mom was taking me since we both had things to do in the same city. I was walking past her and announced I was ready to go and her response was, ""Oh no! You haven't showered yet! We're not leaving with you looking like THAT!"". 

For context, I was born with sunshine blonde hair but when I hit puberty it darkened to dirty blonde. That was 9 years ago already. My Mom had the same thing happen to her when she was little. This colour doesn't look like the pictures when your type ""dirty blonde hair"" in Google. I have named the colour, ""Grease"" because my freshly washed hair colour looks like if a regular blonde hadn't washed their hair for days. I should mention my Mom's darkened to a much nicer almost-brown.

Anyways, I explained that I had showered and her response was ""Well shower again! I can't have you walking beside me looking like that. I would be embarrassed to be seen with you!"" (Yes, because if I just shower again my natural hair colour will TOTALLY change /s) 

I sat on the couch trying not to cry while she sat in the vehicle trying to still get me to come with. We texted back and forth and I told her I would still go IF she apologized. After an HOUR AND A HALF of her I'm-still-not-sorry-because-it's-trues, she said ""I'm sorry"". I didn't believe her but whatever I had an appointment. As soon as I closed the car door behind me  I was met with ""I'm not actually sorry. I just wanted you to get in already. It's true and you're just being emotional about it."" 

About a year later we watched ""Counting On"" because it was on TV and on the show one of the Duggar girls had put her boyfriend's bookshelf in the closet so it was hidden because she thought it didn't look pretty enough to be in the public eye. Every time she met another family member of his they greeted her with, ""OH! So you're the girl who put the bookshelf in the closet!""  I am also a huge lover of books and I felt that it was a great way to say how something that means so little to you could mean everything to someone else. I said to my Mom, ""Hey, you know how you constantly criticize me for buying books I love and taking up space even though they're only in my room and take up a little space?""

""Yeah...""

""You put my bookshelf in the closet."" That ladies and gentlemen is the only time she came close to understanding how her words made me feel. The only time she realized how harsh she could be. I brought up that this might be something I could never forgive her for. That and this hair incident. 

""What hair incident?""

""Remember? When you said I was to ugly to walk next to you?""

""...""

""Because of my hair colour and how you hated it?...""

""I would NEVER say that! I love your hair! You're making this up. I would never say that to you!""

I swear everything to her is just something to gaslight over later. Anyways I got a new phrase out of it that my Mom can actually understand. ""You put my bookshelf in the closet"" = I really liked it and you put it down which hurt me (or something similar)",JUSTNOMIL
"My fiancé and I really tried hard to avoid going completely NC with my mom. Other than one cousin no one in my family will have anything to do with her due to her past blowups and tantrums, understandably so, but that left me with strained family relationships as it’s happened while I was young and we really wanted to be able to provide a whole and complete family for our kids. I have gone NC with my mom for a few years before but she had made some effort and things would improve for a while but it always ended up devolving to the same shit every time. I still held on hope because I wanted nothing more than to have my mom in my life, I’m realizing now that I won’t ever have the mom I want or need which has been a hard pill to swallow. 

What led us to going NC again was a very long chain of events over my pregnancy and subsequent birth of our first child. I’ll try to make it as concise as possible but if you feel there’s more info needed I’m happy to add any details I leave out. The following is why we have gone NC:

1. She constantly is ignoring, mocking and just straight disregarding our boundaries. Which while it’s extremely toxic when it’s just me, after my daughter was born it also went on to include our preferences in raising her, the schedule we keep, foods we feed her, you think of it and she will blatantly do the opposite and when we approach her about it she responds with something along the lines of “yeah, yeah, I know. You’ve told me a million times” or “I’ve raised hundreds of kids and know more than you so let me do it my way” (she babysat as a kid and as a young adult for family friends. I’m her only child and thank god for that)

2. She makes constant, wild and inflammatory accusations about both my fiancé and I. She accused my fiancé of molesting my daughter, he was changing her diaper. When I asked why on earth she would think he would do that she said “because he’s a man, I don’t trust men they’re disgusting” then went on about how she doesn’t trust men because she fees she was vicariously raped by society and the patriarchy even though she admitted she’s never been sexually assaulted. She also accused us of abuse and neglect because we lay our daughter in her crib for naps and do not rock her to sleep. She’s recently also decided to insinuate my fiancé doesn’t love me and is using me to “make his children”. 

3. She undermines us at every turn, going as far as saying things ranging from mild to absolutely crossing the line about us to our daughter in a cutesy voice both in front of us and when she thinks we can’t hear her. We have a baby monitor and she constantly forgets that when she had my daughter some with her in the nursery. 

4. She regularly comes to me to try to talk shit about my fiancé and it is al unfounded. I have made her leave our house twice due to this and I have left her house with my daughter once because of this. One of those times was the night she flipped while my fiancé was changing her diaper and she said she didn’t trust him or us as parents. Another was when she tried to swear me to secrecy about her theory that he is molesting our daughter. 

There are more, smaller, things but these are the big ones. 

Well after going NC things didn’t really get better. She continued to harass us online and through text. We got new numbers and she managed to figure them out and continues to message us. She went as far as showing up at our house when she knew I’d be home alone and tried to push her way in. Things kept escalating and she recently has started making threats to call the cops on us “all day every day” until she knows our daughter is okay. She hasn’t outright said she is going to fight for grandparents rights and I’m not even sure if she knows that’s a thing but the fear that she could terrifies me. She really messed me up as a kid in ways I’m still not able to talk about and as her behavior or willingness to take responsibility for her actions doesn’t seem to have changed I’ll be damned if I let her continue this cycle of trauma in my children’s lives. 

In our state there are no grounds for a grandparent to petition if the parents have been married for at least three months so now we are considering getting legally married at the courthouse. It just really upsets me that we are making a decision that should be a happy and exciting next step for us because of this. I know we can still save up to have the ceremony we want in a few years but I just really don’t like the idea of getting married because of my mom. I’m constantly second guessing everything from my emotions, to me decisions and reactions. I haven’t blocked her because we are saving the messages in case we decide to get a restraining order or an order of protection and on some level it makes me fee more safe having some insight into her state of mind so I can better gauge the current threat. 

Not super sure what I’m looking for here but really any advice or sage words are welcome.",JUSTNOMIL
"DH leaves in a few days for his solo trip home. The whole ordeal has been an absolute shit show. He ordered refundable tickets and spent the whole time waffling between going and not going. A total nightmare because to me him going is basically the nail in our marriage coffin. He decided for real he would go but he wouldn't stay with Squonk. Mostly because she's a creep who likes to watch him sleep or keep him trapped in the house by refusing him transport but also because she has none of her several spare rooms set up as a guest room and he has to sleep on a shitty pull out couch. 


So he's staying with my parents, who actually have a guest bedroom and will lend him a car and just leave him alone because they know how much his mom sucks because my dad had an abusive mom that behaved in a somewhat similar way to Squonk and my family has had to schedule a clandestine vacation just so DH could see his ONLY niece (and we’re the only aunt and uncle) who is now a year old and he has never met.


Well a month ago our marriage counselor told DH he should cut Squonk out of his life. She reasoned that she won't change, and she doesn't care about him as a person, and he is currently destroying his marriage with a person who actually loves him for who he is and wants him to be happy for a bad relationship with a woman who will never get enough out of him. 


Well last night she starts rattling her chains for attention, obviously. It’s been another week. For some reason she starts escalating and starts texting his phone repeatedly. Then she does something she hasn’t done in almost a year. She texts me telling me to make him call. This is all going on while we eat the dinner I worked hard to make (I cook like once-twice a week because we’re both busy and DH doesn’t cook, so it’s usually a big deal). 

Dinner already tainted, DH decides to call Squonk while I go water the garden. He offered to have me in the room to overhear, but I honestly didn’t see the point. I figured she’d railroad him and he’d agree to whatever he was saying.


I come back in about 10 minutes later and he’s wrapping up. He sounds tense and looks miserable. He tells her he loves her (Her response “I hope you do” how fucking manipulative) and hangs up. Turns out he didn’t even tell her he wasn’t staying at her house. Which was the only reason he had to call her. He had ONE thing to communicate and he couldn’t do it.


Anyway. We obviously fought over it, though I’m getting so tired I don’t really get that mad any more. It’s just predictable and sad. The evening was ruined. We went to bed.


This morning I looked at my phone, and I thought “fuck it”. I blocked her number, then I blocked her other number. Then I blocked her email. Then I unsubscribed from her FB posts (her and her whole family already are hidden from my posts). Then I removed her and her family from my Instagram. I’m done. Whatever happens with DH happens but I am 100% over it. DH thinks she’ll try to force her next trip to visit us when he’s there. Fine. He’ll let her. But I’ll be out of town when she visits.",JUSTNOMIL

DD still is not comfortable around her, actually still sometimes cries when MIL looks at her. This is due to MIL’s lack of respect for DD’s boundaries. We have limited visits, but it’s an ongoing (and hopeless and losing) battle. She texts roughly every 2-3 weeks with unavoidable scenarios to manipulate us into letting her see DD, and the guilty button she has installed in D(ear)H is GREAT. 

Most recently she’s asked us to go on vacation with the whole family in the fall. DH’s response was “I’ll let you know, it’s my busy time at work.” (Not a lie) So 2-3 weeks pass and cue tonight. She texts “pick a time when you can go on vacation with us, and we will work around your schedule. Also when is the next time I’ll be able to spend time with DD?”

DH responds with “K, I’ll let you know.” Which is the least rude way he could think of where she still didn’t get what she wanted. Rather than taking a hint, letting it go, and giving us space she immediately responds “let me know about vacation or getting together?”

This woman makes kindly setting boundaries IMPOSSIBLE, and DH refuses to be anything but kind to her. He responds again with “both, I’ve got a lot going on right now.” And her response was “k” (can’t remember if I deleted the post or not, but this starts her “hurt feelings” pattern...)

This is mostly a rant, but I’m always open for advice, although I probably already know what it’s going to be, and it’s next to impossible to get DH on board with flat out telling her NO and BACK OFF. 

Side note: I’m so frustrated with her and full of hate that when he asked me what he should say I told him “how about ‘leave me alone and get out of my life?’ Because that’s what I would say!” And he didn’t even flinch. Because he knows.

ETA: since the majority of initial comments are against DH, I went ahead and crossposted to JustNoSO. Feel free to comment there if you need to be blunt about DH. Continue to commiserate and MIL shame on this post though!",JUSTNOMIL
"So my MIL, Elderly Toddler is absolutely obsessed with my 8 month old daughter. If you refer to my post history, she tried to manipulate us into allowing us to see DD more often despite already seeing her more often than anyone else in our families, she constantly cuts off conversation if DD so much as breathes in her general direction, she turns all conversation about DD into herself as a grandma or her need to see DD. The list goes on. She also constantly hints that she wants to watch DD while we’re at work despite being overweight and unable to physically run after a baby who has started crawling and gets into all sort of trouble. I’ve made damn sure to shut that down as she’s been enrolled in nursery full time. 

I just mentioned today that DD’s nursery absolutely love her to bits (she’s a very happy baby) to the point where the staff in the age groups above her have been playfully arguing because they want to be her key contact person when she moves up to their rooms and she said “I’m not surprised they all want to be with her - I know the feeling”. 
 
Her interest in DD is making me extremely uncomfortable as it’s very obsessive and makes me feel like DD is being treated as the only thing that can make her happy. She keeps trying to engineer situations that she can be more involved in our lives but ignores both DH and I. She’s constantly making comments about how much she wants to hug and kiss DD and how she’s going to be the favourite grandma (she’s 1 of 6 grandparents) and constantly drops passive aggressive comments that she doesn’t see DD and DD doesn’t recognise her.

She’s immature, manipulative, self centred and basically someone I don’t want around my child. My skin crawls if she ever holds her. And I have to physically look away when she shoves her face in DD’s face. I have never left DD unsupervised with her as DD cries whenever she manages to get hold of her after doing grabby hands at DH. It’s gotten to the point where I’d rather not go to the loo during a visit to ensure that DH can’t give in to grabby hands. Yes I know DH is partially part of the problem and I’m working to get him out of the fog so I would appreciate if advice doesn’t go to JustNoSO. 

So please help me. I need advice on how to either address the obsessive behaviour with ET without being outright nasty or rude or even upfront (it won’t be supported by DH and she’ll just play the victim)  or how to deal with it without wanting to take DD far far away from her everytime we have a visit. Please and thank you.",JUSTNOMIL
"I’ve been thinking a lot about my relationship with Dramila lately because of my last post.  Sometimes I wonder if I’m being the asshole.  Then I remember bullshit like her last visit and remember it’s definitely not me.  She’s not the worst JustNo.  Just has FLEAS from her narc mom.  However, she is difficult.

She lives with DH’s sister in another state 350 miles away.  The drive is long enough that we don’t visit very often because it’s a minimum 3 day trip.

Two summers ago she decided she would come down for about a week.  What this actually means is that either me or one of my two SIL’s have to drive her all the way here and back because she refuses to drive due to an easily treatable medical condition she refuses to treat.  

I love a good roadie and like to drive, so I volunteered to get her.  This was before she inferred my mom was going to suffer a long time in hospice because she was fat, so I was willing.

I got up there to get her and she mentions casually, “Oh, by the way, granddaughter is coming, too.”  Wut?

I was not ever asked about granddaughter coming.  I made a ton of plans to entertain her, none of which involved granddaughter.  She was staying with DH’s other sister (who lives near us), but we were driving her around and entertaining her.  We live in a major tourist destination, so now all of the entry fees we had to pay were doubled.  No spine then, so I sighed and said ok.  Hospitality is a major, major part of the culture I grew up in, and it would be unimaginable to deny a guest a request.  I believe she assumed granddaughter would get in free to everything because I worked at a summer tourist destination and had a discount card.  Had I been consulted I would have informed her this was not the case.  Rule #1 with Dramila-very presumptuous.

I took her all around to all of the attractions here, spending double than what was planned due to bringing along the local niece and nephew, too, so they could spend time with Dramila.  

Never heard a thank you.  Not once.  She’s gracious on every visit initially, then gets increasingly demanding.  

At the end of the week I told DH he was taking her home.  I’d had enough, and he agreed.  She had told me one of the nieces/nephews in the house in which she resides had no place to sleep.  LIke a dope I said she could take my son’s old loft bed.  So we had to drive my truck back to take her home crammed full of the loft bed, which is quite large.

Then she goes shopping in my storage unit, demands this and that.  I finally said that the only other things we were getting rid of were two air conditioners.  She clapped her hands and was delighted and told the sob story of how very hot all of the nephews were.  (The SIL she lives with has a ton of kids, including the granddaughter that tagged along.). She then demanded them and I reminded her that the truck was full.

“Well, when can you bring them?”

Again, wut?  I get to pay another round of gas 700 miles round trip in a pickup to deliver you an air conditioner I was wanting to sell and recoup some of what I’d paid for?  No thanks.  Hard pass.

I deferred, and somehow magically they never got their air conditioner, which was also somehow sold online.

The kicker was she was telling tales about the kid that had no bed.  SIL was PISSED she came back with the bed, plus other furniture we weren’t using at the time.  We now have a deal the SIL is consulted before any item is dropped off.",JUSTNOMIL

&amp;#x200B;

These snippets of my life have stuck with me all these years. The conversations are translated.

&amp;#x200B;

In fifth grade, I had a four-question homework assignment to turn in. School was incredibly easy and boring for me, so I generally didn't bother checking my work for mistakes. It wasn't like I could focus on going back over my answers anyway; I had a condition that my mum diagnosed as ""carelessness."" She wasn't entirely wrong. I didn't put much care into school; I would get bored with in-class ""quiet reading time"" because I'd have already finished the book, and then fuck around quietly or daydream about dragons. So sure, I didn't care, but I was doing fine anyway. (We now know it is/was ADD.)

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I turned the assignment in without a care and got it back the same day. Across the top, the neatly-detached worksheet had four characters on it in red ball-point ink: ""75% C"". A giant X was drawn over question number two. I laughed. I had gotten one of the questions wrong, and that was technically 25% of the assignment, so yes, technically I got a C. I thought it was funny, anyway. It wouldn't have affected my grades at all, so I didn't care. It was trivial.

&amp;#x200B;

I brought the assignment home to laugh about it with my mum. ""Look, I got a C for missing one question!"" I chuckled. ""Isn't that silly!""

&amp;#x200B;

But really I should have just binned the damn thing.

&amp;#x200B;

She did not find it funny at all. Instead, she berated me. ""Are you serious? Only four questions and you couldn't get it right? Of course you deserve the C! You got a quarter of the assignment wrong after all. How many times do I have to tell you to check your work? Why don't you ever check your work after you finish it?"" ^(2)

&amp;#x200B;

As she spat her venom at me, my eyes grew wide and I froze in place. I didn't realize I had committed such a grave mistake. This was clearly worse than getting three out of fifty problems wrong on a timed arithmetic test. It was, after all, a much larger percentage of deducted points. I couldn't even get that one question right. I didn't do well enough. I wasn't good enough.

&amp;#x200B;

This sort of lambasting happened many more times with other assignments, but I stopped laughing about mistakes that didn't actually matter. I had become afraid to show her mistakes. I was now afraid to make mistakes. I stopped being open with her.^(3) I knew I couldn't get everything perfect all the time, but she demanded it of me, so I strove for perfection. If I wasn't perfect, I wasn't good enough for her approval (or any sort of positive attention). If I made an honest mistake or caused an accident, I tried to hide it. And if she found it, I would place blame on anything that wasn't me. She unknowingly showed me how to do it and I learned from the best. (It didn't do me all that much good, though; the wooden spoon still found its way to my rump and her wrath still overfloweth, but I did it anyway. There's always that sliver of hope, right? lol)

&amp;#x200B;

At some point, I actually did stop caring. Carelessness became a lifestyle. If I wasn't going to get an A in a difficult class, why bother trying? Why put the effort into studying and working hard when it wouldn't be enough?

&amp;#x200B;

When I eventually flunked easy college classes by not turning in final assignments or showing up for exams, she started telling me that she just wanted me to ""do my best"" and ""try my hardest"" -- as long as I put the effort in and still passed, it would be enough. Those words were as effective as a dairy fart in a mall garage on Black Friday. It was too little, too late. My father tried to use material rewards as encouragement. If I got As that semester, he would buy me that [electric cello](https://www.jordanmusic.com/cellos) that I had been drooling over. Yeah whatever, I'll eventually find a job and save enough to buy it myself, I thought. I didn't care.

&amp;#x200B;

I somehow graduated on time. ""We're so proud of you,"" they said. ""You're so full of shit,"" I thought. They weren't proud; they were relieved. I was no longer a possible dropout. For them, I scraped by and saved their face for their friends' unavoidable inquiries about my studies. I knew I was only meeting [the bare minimum of expectations](https://www.etsy.com/listing/685774722/as-expected-graduation-card), but at this point it didn't matter. I got my degree and fucked off to another country. Because fuck living with my parents again.

&amp;#x200B;

To this day, I struggle with perfectionism and blame. I've come a long way, but sometimes I still fall back into old habits. They die a long, slow death.

^(2) There were some other things she said, but that gives you a pretty good idea. I've come to realize that to her, me getting a bad grade meant she got a bad grade, because I was merely an extension of her and she lived vicariously through me. She wanted me to be what she wished she could be, and getting a C on a homework assignment wasn't part of that vision, so she took it out on me. She took a lot of her personal issues and struggles out on me. I was lucky enough to have parents who didn't hit me for poor academics, but my mum still hit me for other stupid shit. I'll post about that another day.

^(3) She always lamented about our terrible relationship and how I never talked to her about anything. lol.",JUSTNOMIL
"Thanks to u/frecklesforever93 for the name! It’s perfect! I’ll refer to MIL as IGG for short. 

Just a quick update on the MIL/baby shenanigans. I never know how to flair these, advice is always welcome. 

I posted a couple days ago about DH and I announcing our pregnancy to IGG. It’s been a few weeks since the announcement and knowing her, I asked DH if IGG had contacted him about baby stuff at all. IGG doesn’t like me, obviously, so she will sidestep me and contact DH directly. 

You guys. IGG texted DH: 

“Hello my darling son! I just ran into (old friend) who told me (old friend’s son and wife) are also expecting a baby boy, due in December. (Old friend) came over and gave me a baby bath and a stroller so I can be ready for little Baby (Lastname).” 

*record scratch* 

....what? DH hasn’t responded to her yet.

I’ve previously mentioned we live 3 hours away from them. When exactly will she be bathing my child in her home?

Also, in general, what is their damn obsession with parading their grandchildren around the neighborhood or wherever in a stroller??

"Hey everyone. I’ve been lurking this sub for quite some time and using all your stories as support to deal with my own JNMom issues. There’s something that’s been stopping me every time before posting here myself.. guilt? Fear? Thinking I’m overreacting? Who knows. 

I had an incident today and it just shook me to my core. She’s done some pretty horrible stuff in the past that was more fitting to the raised by narcissists subreddit but this takes the goddamn cake. 

So today I had a three week old baby shoved in my face as I was getting up because she needed someone to watch it while she helped a client (note: I live at home part time while I’m not at work until I fully pay off my student loans). Fine, no big deal really apart from me being terrified of hurting this strangers child or doing anything the mother may not approve of. Somehow miraculously everything goes well. No crying, no screaming (maybe one day I’ll actually be cut out for this whole motherhood thing!). I then went upstairs to return the baby to his mom and as I’m just sitting rocking him JNMom bursts out of her office and exclaims “Oooh how cute! I hope you give me at least one baby so I can coo over it”. Guys. That one sentence stroke fear into my heart and had me seeing red. What a red flag!! I thought she had gotten over her incessant baby rabies but clearly not. She basically abandoned me as a child and I guess never had her “mother” moment but my kid is not gonna be where this woman gets her fix. No way. 

My boyfriend and I have been together 4 years and have had the marriage/baby talk and it’s definitely going to happen when we’re more financially stable within the next 2-4 years but I am already feeling so guilty knowing he’s gonna have to deal with my monster JNMom. 

There’s so much more that’s happened that I think I may be ready to share with this lovely little reddit community but this was the first sign of unsavoury times to come. 

Keep your fingers crossed for me! Love you all.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi all, this is my first time posting to this sub and I haven't been following for long, so apologies if I'm not doing it right. 

TL;DR what's the best way to ask my MIL to wear less or no perfume?


My MIL isn't without her difficulties but we generally get along. However, she wears a lot of perfume and it. is. too. much. Last time she stayed with us she literally bathed in it. (No really she bought the scented body wash as a special treat to herself.) Although I didn't realize it at the time, the scent of the perfume actually prevented me from bonding with my newborn baby because my baby smelled like Chanel No 5 rather than a baby. It wasn't a huge deal, but after MIL left and I gave baby a bath, I smelled baby and instantly felt more of a connection because she didn't smell like a rose's asshole. Every time MIL sends us a package, everything reeks like the perfume. She will send clothes for the kiddos, and wash them as a favor to me, but they still reek just from being in her house so I have to rewash everything.

Anyway enough back story. She is coming to visit soon and I need to find a way to ask her to cool it with the perfume. My spouse has asked her to cut down
 before, and it seemed to help for a while, but last time she visited it was intolerable To give her the benefit of the doubt, I think she's just nose blind to it. Also, wearing this particular perfume is ""her thing"" and considers it part of her personality in a way, so it makes this a more sensitive subject.

My thought is to tell her that we've started using mostly unscented products (true) and therefore we're sensitive to perfume smells, and could she please leave it at home. I just wonder if we should be more honest about how it's the perfume specifically that bothers us so she doesn't think she has to go out and buy all unscented shampoo, lotion, etc and then come out with the martyr complex about how she just wants to make us happy. 

Well this is a long post for such a small issue, so thanks for reading and for the advice.",JUSTNOMIL

The worst thing GG ever did. 



This is really hard for me to write, and probably very hard for others to read. I’ve spent the better part of two decades trying to forget this moment, because it is bar none the worst thing Granny Gator ever did to me, and this is the same woman who shit herself twice on purpose just to keep me from going out on my 21st birthday. This event unfortunately shaped the person I eventually became, in ways both good and bad. Here’s my best stab at not burying my issues. Sometimes you have to get the bad stuff out of an infected wound before it will heal,  here’s hoping it works on souls as well as body parts. 


It was the day my grandmother told me how my mother died, and also the day I learned that my father didn’t love anything but himself. 

Background: I didn’t grow up with my parents, I never so much as went home from the hospital with them on the day I was born. I was given to my grandmother instead, which was the beginning of a very miserable life for me. I have no memory at all of the woman who gave birth to me. It’s like she never existed for me, and there is a reason for that lack of connection. You see, Granny Gator erased her.

Until I was 10, nobody spoke about my mother. Never. Not a single word was ever mentioned about her or her side of the family, and if I asked questions about her the punishment for it was always severe. Once, when I was 7 she made me hold a mouthful of the hottest hot sauce she could find in my mouth for twenty minutes because I asked her what my mother’s name was. 

I had blisters in my mouth for three days after that, and I stopped asking, at least for a while. On my tenth birthday Granny Gator asked me what I wanted, you see, birthdays were a special day in our house, because it was the ONE day a year that Granny Gator would actually let me ask for something with any hope of getting it, it was also the one day a year when she was genuinely nice to me all day long and wouldn’t find some way to fuck with my mind and after working up my nerve for an entire year I told her what I wanted. 


I asked her where my mother was, what happened to her, and what her name was. It was all I wanted. No toys, no cake, I just wanted to know who my mother was. GG didn’t take it well, to say the very least.


I had never seen the look on her face that day before, the moment my questions left my lips GG went so still that the hair on the back of my neck stood up and I felt cold all over. She didn’t yell, didn’t scream, didn’t grab me. Nothing like that, that would have been normal, I could have handled that. Not this, though. Her expression just went...flat, emotionally void, nearly lizard-like with how empty she seemed inside. She watched me with that flat, lizard expression for a few minutes, saying nothing at all, until I was so terrified I thought I might start crying ...and then she answered me. I’ll take what she said and did to me next to my grave. 


She looked me in the eyes, and calmly said “ You want to know about your mother? Fine. I’ll tell you all about her, sit there on the couch and don’t move until I get back.” 


GG went down the hall and into her room and shut the door for a few minutes and when she came back she had a brown folder in her hands, she sat down beside me on the couch and then she put her arm around my shoulders and pulled me close. It made my skin feel like it was trying to crawl right off my body when she touched me, but I didn’t move because she laid that folder carefully in my lap. I stared at it because I was afraid to even touch it, I could feel her eyes just fixed on my face, waiting for whatever was going to happen when I opened the folder.   When she talked, her mouth was by my ear and I could feel her breath on my skin. It wasn’t quite a whisper but it was close, it made you listen harder to whatever she said. 


“Open it. “  this was what I’d asked for, but I knew something bad was about to happen l. I just knew it. The last thing in the world I wanted to do was open that folder, but when GG tightened her grip on my shoulder and dug her nails into my arm I knew I had to. I opened it and I looked down and at first I didn’t really understand what I was looking at, maybe it was my brain trying to give me time to look away, but GG put her hand on mine to keep me from doing it, like she somehow knew exactly what I wanted to do. 

“That’s your mother,” she said, but it sounded like she was under water because my mind finally lost the battle to protect me from what I was looking at. I’d never seen a picture of my mother before that moment. Not once. The first image of my mother that I ever saw was of her with her head blown apart by the sawed off shotgun she shot herself in the face with the night she killed herself. 

The photo was from the crime scene at my parents apartment, and that first picture was a close up of her head, at least what was left of it. I remember how tight GG’s grip on me was, and how white my mother’s teeth looked even though her upper jaw was mostly gone. She had blond hair, I could see a few patches of it that were somehow not covered in blood. It was the same color as mine. 

I couldn’t move, I couldn’t speak, I couldn’t even cry. I just looked at my mother and tried to see something that wasn’t awful about her. Then GG spoke up again, and she sounded so pleased with herself that it makes me sick all over again just to think about it. 

 She told me that we were going to play a birthday game, and that for every photo I looked at for at least five minutes I could ask her one question about my mother and she she would answer it, but I had to look, otherwise the first picture she showed me would be the only one she would let me see. My only memory of my mother would then be that one image. Forever.

So I agreed to play her game.

My grandmother took the top photo and tucked it behind the rest to show me the next one and I remember how kind GG’s voice was when she told me that what I was looking at was my mother’s brain on her bedroom wall behind her. One of her teeth was embedded in the plaster. I looked at around twenty six or twenty seven photos that day, and GG kept her word, after looking for five minutes at each one she answered a question about my mother. 

Her name was Pamela.

She loved to work on cars. 

Her favorite color was green.

She had two brothers. 

I had an older half brother that I had never met. 

She was 8 months pregnant when she died. 

The pictures got progressively more awful, and sometimes I still have nightmares about them, but GG wasn’t finished yet. While I was looking GG told me that the reason she did what she did and gave me to GG was because she didn’t want to be my mom. She didn’t want me. She never had, and the only person that had ever wanted me or ever would want me was GG, because my mother loved drugs more than she could ever love me. 

I got angry, and for the first time in my life I looked my grandmother in the eye and told her that I didn’t believe her.  My Dad loved me, and I was going to prove it because I was going to go live with him instead of her. I got off the couch and threw the folder on the floor and ran to my bedroom. I filled a book bag with as much of my stuff as I could manage and I headed for the door. I knew that my dad was staying in a trailer park about a mile away down our road, I figured that I could walk there to get to him and GG could go crawl back into whatever pit of hell she came from to start with. 

I thought she’d try to stop me, I wasn’t even allowed to go out of our yard without her supervision, much less a mile away on a fairly busy road but she didn’t. She just watched me with those dead eyes and a smirk on her face. I should have known it was all going to go to shit then and there. 


I did it though, I was terrified but I did it, I walked all the way to my Dad’s door alone, crying the entire way and I knocked...it was his friend that opened the door, because my Dad was asleep in the back room. When I woke him up, I told him that I didn’t want to stay with GG anymore. I said that I wanted to be with him and I begged him to let me stay. I promised him that I wouldn’t bother him, I wouldn’t be in the way and that I’d be so good he wouldn’t even know I was there. 


He didn’t have to say a word, because when I looked into his eyes I could already see his answer and it was no.
.

GG was right, and that was why she was smiling when I left. She knew exactly what would happen the entire time. That was the moment that killed the last tiny bit of childhood innocence left inside me and it was what broke my will to fight GG about how she treated me for the rest of her life and over a decade of my own.  I never fought back again. 


The walk back home to face her was the longest walk I ever took, and when I came back through the door GG never said a word. The folder was gone, and we never spoke about my mother again and I never ever asked to stay with my father again afterwards either. I gave up and then I tried to kill myself two months later because I didn’t see a way out of my situation besides death..


So. There it is. The worst thing GG ever did to me and the thing that crippled me emotionally so seriously that to this day I struggle to connect with other people in a positive way.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hello everyone. My crybaby, tantrum throwing JNMIL is back at again. So sit back, relax, and enjoy me screeching out my frustrations about my MIL, Colonel Waterworks (CW).

Alright. So, my lovely DH just turned 21 this week. We don’t drink, it’s just not our thing, so instead DH and I decided to have a nice celebration in our home. Now, DH is in the military and we’re on an overseas duty station so it’s just the two of us. 

Now, DH and I are high school sweethearts. But he grew up in a different state than I with a very specific culture and food style. For months now, DH has been talking about how much he missed this one meal his stepfather used to make and how he’s excited to visit home next year and ask him to make it (DH is a poor cook, but he does try bless his heart!). 

*Sidenote* DH’s stepfather was married to CW from the time DH was a small child until fairly recently when CW went a bit batshit crazy. It was not an amicable divorce and they do not speak to each other.

So I decided that I’ve been stepping up my cooking game, I’ll try to make this complex recipe. I sneakily call SFIL and ask for his recipe. He didn’t have an exact recipe but happily gave me many helpful tips and tricks. So the day of DH’s birthday I decorate and cook while he’s away at work, including a cookie cake which he had been wanting for a long time. 

DH returns from work and is so ecstatic! He happily made a plate and gushed to me how perfect it was. He took photos and snap chatted to his family what I had done for him and everyone was happy. 

Until CW got word. We’re still on NC and refused to acknowledge her which is just killing her. She sees DH’s posts on Facebook about what I did and how excited and happy he was. She calls me immediately after and I ignore it. She leaves a voicemail for me that DH and I listen to together .

“*sob* What’s the meaning of this?? Are you trying to take overrrrr?? You can’t cook (insert food type), you dumbass, you don’t know how!! Tell DH to call meeeee! I love my baby boy, he needs to come home now!”

She also posted all over Facebook how much she missed him and how she’s never known true love until she held him in her arms and how she’ll always love him more than anyone!!

The comments of everyone being like, “isn’t he married?” were amazing 😂

Idk guys, is that irritating or am I dramatic?",JUSTNOMIL
"Long story short, I have to have genetic testing done and I needed information that is contained on my birth admittance records that my adopted mother (AD) has always claimed she didn't have.

I know you can't answer all the questions asked, but that paperwork has plenty of answers I need. Please send the answers that you can ASAP, and mail me my adoption information. I can't afford the $500 fee to open my adoption records, and I need this information for my physical and mental health providers

Her:  I sent you all the info I had when you asked for it. This was all included. It was about two years ago.

Her: The info I sent you had all of this information.

Me: Ummmm... No. You told me that you had sent everything when I lived with Robert. I never got anything. You told me you didn't have any information, like social security numbers. You never sent it. When I asked two years ago you said you didn't have anything. 

[Robert was my abusive ex] 

Her: Look. I have no reason to keep anything. I sent it when you told me you wanted it. I didn't look for social security numbers so I have no idea what that's about. I may have parts of it left, but when you told me you were wanting more info, I sent it. No interest in keeping it.

[This is always her canned response when I ask for any information. She's repeatedly lied about not having any helpful info, or having sent what she does have] 

Her:There were two and three copies of some things. You got some of it years ago during your first pregnancy. I will look and send whatever I might find. Address?

Me: address sent

Her:Looking at the form, from memory, there was nothing major. Drugs and alcohol used up until birth. Apgar low gained color quickly. Vaginal delivery full term.

Me: What's going to happen to Bob when you guys can't take care of him

[Bob is a bird] 

Her: When we die?

Me:That's not what I said. If that's the case, then sure. But my understanding when we last spoke about him was that you guys were getting close to being done with having birds

Her: Well, if we don't re-home him first, he will go to whoever gets the house

Me: Wow. Ok

Her: Well, I don't have money to send him anywhere and wouldn't send him alone and he seems happy, so re-homing him is not a priority right now. 

Me: So me coming and getting him wasn't even an option

C'mon. Like I said, he's happy. I wasn't thinking anything about him going anywhere. With or without me. Or yo.

Me: You know what is fine...

I was hoping you would do the right thing about the adoption paperwork and my medical records but that seems to be a bust

I was hoping you would do the right thing about about dad (though I wasn't quite sure what that was), when I broke down and told you what gist and core of the problem

I was hoping you would do the right thing about Bob, when the time comes... Because come what may, you know I love him and I'll take good care of him.... 

Ok. So like I said, I will send what I find. Please stop thinking I am hiding something. I am not keeping this info from you. Perhaps you did receive it and didn't keep track. I want nothing to do with this info from your early days or any of it. You are an adult. The right thing about Bob is take care of him and then decide what to do when the time comes. I am not going to bust your chops over a bird. I understand you would like him.  How I handle anything beyond those are on me. I will get you the info I find and send it tomorrow in the mail. Good night...

Me: Obviously that leaves me speechless. 


 [This was the last thing she said to me when I told her about my adopted father (AF) I guess I'm supposed to gloss over or ignore him] 

I really am speechless....


Edit /Update: I sent a text requesting tracking

Me: Please add tracking to the paperwork, as I have never received any of the paperwork you said you've sent. I'll send you money for tracking

Her: All I had is on it's way. It will be there Monday.

[I don't think she added tracking. I doubt I'll ever see anything]",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi JustNoMil so I’m getting married in literally a month and my mom has had previous overbearing tendencies and now after setting up boundaries she has asked if we could have monthly dinner dates after I’m married. First of all is this normal to have dinner with your mom once a month every month after you’ve married and moved out? I personally feel like she’s asking a lot of me and is asking to place our relationship over FDH and i’s. Am I over reacting here or is this not normal?

Edit: it’s dinner with just my mom and myself. Also we’ve never done anything like this before.",JUSTNOMIL
"So as the title says. This lady is my daughter's bio dad's mum. Her son has only been involved the past 2.5 years. Daughter sees him once every 2 weeks. He puts her on a tablet to play Roblox and feeds her sandwiches and super noodles. 

Before her son was 'involved', daughter used to go round to MIL's, but MIL is so proud of her son being involved now that she encourages him to care for her alone and doesn't see my daughter so much herself. She has seen her since birth. She was AT the birth. I was 18 and she was quite insistent. 

Anyway, MIL can be very controlling and over-involved. When I was a new mum I thought it was lovely how helpful she was being. But she did some strange things. For example, I overheard her calling daughter 'my baby'. No big deal on its own, but she bought baby bottles and would try to sneak bottled milk to daughter (I was breastfeeding).

She would also often do 'harmless' things without my permission. When I was on honeymoon a few years back, she was taking care of daughter. When I returned I learned that she had someone else babysit. I just feel like she didn't respect me because she felt I was 'young clueless single mum'.  

These days,  when I'm talking to her son over email and whatnot, it is actually often her I'm speaking to. She will arrange and organise everything for him. She drives him around, he won't get the bus. He just recently moved out of her home and she will drive to his place to drive him to ours to get daughter, even though it's a 15 minute pretty straightforward bus ride. 

I got my daughter a passport a few years ago, and we've taken her on a few lovely holidays around Europe. MIL kicked up a huge stink about me getting her a passport,  implying it was illegal without her (then absent) son's permission (it's not). She then accused me of pulling her out of school for these trips (all taken during school holidays). She was just really weirdly annoyed about me travelling with daughter. 

So she drops this text today that she has 'promised' my daughter that she will take her to New York this August (my daughter hasn't mentioned a thing, so unsure). Her son is getting married this July, and they have been pushing boundaries more than usual this year, which is a whole different set of issues, but it isn't the first bombshell that she's dropped. Usually we just try to leave each other alone and give bio dad the contact.

I don't feel comfortable having daughter travel far away from us, with a lady that I don't really get along with, at such short notice. I don't understand why, if she wants some quality time,  she can't take daughter to London for the day or something more local. 

Not sure why posting,  just want to get it out.

Edit: she is arguing that she ran it past her son, and as he gives permission,  it should be fine. There has been this huge power game of what they can and cannot demand from me and I guess this is just the next saga in that.",JUSTNOMIL
"So I don't post here super regularly, and in the event any reader wants context on who Jane the Ripper is: Shes my(21F) justNOmom, shes been physically abusive since I grew old enough to hit her back, and mentally abusive my entire life. Our largest source of contention is a felon shes been dating for ~3 years whom she claims to be my biological father and expects me to be a good little girl and play house. I moved out ~2 years ago because living with both was unbearable. 

My most recent birthday was right before mothers day and due to her hurling insults at me during a visit, I have not-officially gone NC (meaning I've never texted her to tell her why). I didn't send her a message on mothers day which I expected to cause an uproar.  

Onto the present-day issue. **ALSO Trigger Warning for mentions of suicidal thoughts**

I've been waiting for her to send a message on how terrible I am and Jane the Ripper had finally provided. This could be the beginning of an extinction burst. [The message](https://imgur.com/a/xLJsTfB) 

In the event you'd like to not read it, the premise is ""Why can't you love me, you're an awful daughter so you have no right to judge me, feel bad, also I tried to commit suicide but you wouldn't know that because you're a terrible daughter!""

Originally I was very concerned about the mention of her suicide attempt, though to be entirely honest I expected it to happen and am only really surprised it took till now. On another hand a part of me feels like its utter bullshit and shes lying. As a brief disclaimer, I'm not one to tell someone they don't have depression and that their issues aren't real. I've personally been diagnosed with chronic depression and have had my own battles with such feelings. I just struggle to 100% believe her when she says this, because I know her. 

A part of me is incredibly angry that Jane's using THIS as a method to make me speak to her. When I came to her, twice over the course of my life and told her ""Mom I'm not in a good place, I want to kill myself and I'm afraid I'll do it."" she entirely dismissed me. Jane the Ripper told me to get over it, and that everyone feels sad, that she's sad and that not everything is about me. 

The most enraging part is that she'd even say that if I was having problems I shouldn't let it escalate to the point where I'm going to legitimately make an attempt, that I should seek help!!!! I shouldn't be the one who is responsible for her well being, as I've said people say in this sub I am not an emotional support animal! She has one of those already! I'm not responsible for her killing herself, her actions are her owns. Jane's supposed to be the adult in this situation not me. 

She keeps pressuring me to accept her boyfriend and to love their relationship. I can firmly say that I will never accept their relationship. I know I'm biased and a lot of people will think ""ah she doesn't like her step-dad, what a brat"" but I hope people on this sub can understand it differently. He's an addict who won't receive help, he sells his drugs to others and is both physically ad mentally abusive to her even. I've seen the bruises and marks, she cant dismiss everything as ""Oh I just fell down and hurt myself haha I'm oooold!"" I've hear the fights, I've fucking seen them. It goes way deeper than just ""not wanting mommy to be happy!"" Even then I supported her when she was going on the common dating sites, I was happy to meet her boyfriends who were genuinely good men. Its so convenient for her to forget that.  Sure they had their issues but as an example, being highly invested in your work is far better than smoking crack and beating the shit out of your SO. 

I'm so frustrated her line of reasoning is that just because I have issues, which granted I do, I have no right to judge her. That's not how the world works in my eyes, there is not a single human being alive who I think is a perfect person who has no issues and therefore is the only person capable of deciding ""huh ya know that family might be a bit toxic"". I'm sick of her rug-sweeping bullshit.

Jane the Ripper always brings up my childhood but I personally haven't said anything about it in roughly two years! My issues are her being a piece of shit to me in the present, and having no remorse! She mentions that I was sooo close to her until I hit puberty, that's a lie. We stopped being close when I started to think for myself and no longer be a perfect puppet. I didn't want to dress in overly frilly princess dresses, I wanted to go outside and ride on a bike. Just because I would eat a certain food when I was a one year old potato doesn't mean I absolutely will love it when I'm 10. Things change and she couldn't handle it when she couldn't predict or control every little thing about me. She had never raised any of her children up to their teens because by the time they hit double digits CPS had taken the away, and while I don't know this for certain Id guess it was for abuse because she got 0 time with them unless it was supervised and their fathers all got FULL custody.

The worst part, the part I feel most guilty about is that I legitimately only want her to survive until her/my dog dies (its in her care) because fuck I don't want to be the one who has to put him down. No shelter will take him because he's horribly behaved and very aggressive, I cant care for him, the only thing I can think to do is euthanizing him and I don't want to have to do that because I care for the little asshole.

I know a NC letter will likely only fuel the fire but I'm so fucking tempted. I don't know what to say in a way that isn't just ""I hate you and never speak to me again. I don't care if you die"".

I would appreciate advice, primarily in regards to writing a letter or thoughts on what was said in this post. Advice on how to get a retraining order and protecting myself isn't useful at the moment, I've received plenty in the past and it's been helpful but I think on that basis I'm fine right now.

"Background info: BF and I are currently living with my family, which includes my JNMom. Eating with her is a nightmare since it literally becomes an interrogation.

I sit down for dinner (I eat seperately from my family and BF is at work) and AS SOON as the meal is served, JNMom will start asking questions, from the absurd to passive aggressive.

""BF stayed home for a few days! We thought he'd been fired!"" *He has vacation days and used them.*

""Did BF call JNSILs for Mother's Day?"" *No, because we've been NC with them for years*

""Do you like the laundromat that you and BF use? How do you load money into the card? *Yes, questions are this stupid.*

""Let BF know that there's hot dogs in the fridge if he's hungry"" *You've told me this a billion times*

""Is BF almost out of Calvin Kleins? I'm happy to do his laundry if he's too busy."" *Barf.*

""What is that takeout you brought yesterday? Thai? Chinese? Japanese?"" *I told you yesterday it was Thai.*

""Why is the refridgerator spoling the food? *I have no clue*

"My mom keeps trying to overrule everything with my parenting. I have a 5 (but almost 6!) Month old son. Hes a happy healthy baby. I keep getting unsolicited annoying advice. 
He just started eating baby foods. Once a day he gets a jar of baby food. This was recommended by his pediatrician until he gets used to food. 
My mom is constantly trying to sneak him bites of table food off her plate anytime I'm not looking. (I still live with my mom so this is a daily thing)
I can tell her no but she puts on an act and tells me ""but he's sooo hungry. he's begging for food"" 
I'll tell her he just nursed half an hour ago but she won't listen. 
She keeps telling me he needs more floor time while picking him up after Ive put him on the floor for tummy time. I am sick of all my parenting decisions being ignored like I'm stupid. She throws temper tantrums everytime I dont listen to her and gives me the silent treatment. Its infuriating.",JUSTNOMIL
"This is a short one. But I'm still confused by it, even after 2 decades.       



JNM has always had weird things about food. I won't even try to guess why. But she's a little past the crazy line when it comes to not wasting food. I won't get into it (ok, I guess I will), but even if it's fuzzy and has multiple colours on it that don't belong, she'll cut around it and just cook it a little longer. Iron stomach for sure. If something is basically free, she'll buy it all and eat it exclusively until it's gone. She once did this with kale and celery. She would blend it up with water and drink it. For days. But her blender was crap, so it remained very fiber heavy. It caused enough problems she almost went to the doctor (like blockage for 2+ weeks). But that's more than you need to know about her bowel movements, or lack thereof. (She also has a crawl space ""pantry"" that has food older than me in it. She lives alone yet has 2 FULL fridges/freezers, a deep freeze, and enough overflowing pantry space to feed a family of 4 for a year at least, though it's all old so don't eat it).      



But  back to the story: I'm around 16. I made myself something to eat. I think it was meatballs and mashed potatoes, because I had cranberry sauce. So the spoon I used to scoop some cranberry sauce on my plate had some residual sauce on it. Like half a cranberry and some random spots. I went to put it in the sink, to keep the counters clean and so I'll remember to wash it after eating. JNM is in the kitchen, and sees me do this. And then she just flips. She says I need to lick the spoon first. I said I don't want to. She says I'm wasting food and I have to. I offer her the spoon, but she doesn't want it. It's my ""mess"", so I have to clean it up. Not wash it though, that's not ok. That spoon caused an argument that lasted almost an hour, full of screaming, cussing each other out, and then silent treatment because I was such a horrible child. (And the wholee argument stayed on topic of the spoon somehow.)         



And I wonder why I have a weird relationship with food...",JUSTNOMIL
"Okay, she's not technically my MIL, but my boyfriend and I have been together since middle school and have a baby together. MIL is just for the sake of simplicity... I'm 19 and he's about to be 19. Baby isn't even 4 months old. On mobile, who cares. 

Our baby had RSV on day 13 of life and was hospitalized for 24 hours because of it. The baby next door had a code blue and the peds nurse...wasn't the same in the morning. Not our close call, but scary to encounter so soon after our baby was born. MIL knows about this. 

My MIL does not play nice with her mom (baby's great grandma, an angel...her and her husband watch our son while we're at work), my boyfriend, and I. She sees us as satanist children and herself as the most holy woman to exist. She's a horrible person.

Despite this, we allow her to see our son on the occasion that she actually ASKS to see him, or go 50 yards away to her her mom's house and ask. 

We both made it crystal clear that NOBODY is to kiss the baby under any circumstances. He had RSV. We are not taking any chances, especially with the flu and measles epidemic. 

She has a friend that pretty much lives with her. She is disgusting. Her teeth are green. That's fine, I just don't get along with her, nor does she talk to me. 

Every time my befriend or I knock on the door, we hear scuttling and our son is in MIL's arms. There's a window. MIL's friend was holding the baby from what we could see. 

We remind her, nobody we don't know can play with the baby, let alone kiss him. She says that's fine and goes off subject. 

Things got serious yesterday. Baby's great great grandpa's funeral started. MIL asks to hold and show off the baby, I agree. 

I leave them alone for a few minutes. You guessed it. Someone I don't know is Kissing. The. Baby. 

I explained to them both that that is not acceptable. It's not their baby. He was sick as a newborn. Don't kiss babies without permission.

I tell my boyfriend and he's fuming, too. 

I'm at work for part 2 of the funeral, but I let my boyfriend know that MIL is not to be near our son without direct supervision, possibly not at all until he's a year old (past the age of immediate hospitalization if someone has a cold and gives him RSV). I haven't spoken a word to MIL since. 

I don't feel like the asshole here at all, but I'm fuming, I *WANT* to be the asshole. She needs a life changing experience here in order to change anything. Help me talk to my boyfriend about appropriate punishment, he'll agree I'm sure.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi there. Long time lurker first time poster, made a new account for this because who knows how personal it may get.

The shortest version of the story that I can give is this: my narcissistic JNMIL has cancer. She’s a longtime heavy smoker and former(?) heavy drinker, and it finally caught up to her. No one is surprised. Even she is not surprised, though she is definitely feeling sorry for herself. We’re moving back to our hometown for a number of reasons and supporting her is pretty high on the list. I could use advice on how to support a narcissist during a time they are actually a victim without playing right into their hands, and on being a good wife to my husband who’ll be spending more time with his mother over the next few months than he has in literal years.

Longer version: We’ve lived in a city halfway across the state from the town where we both grew up, and where our families still live, for a little over a year and a half now. When JNMIL and my very JY grandmother both got cancer diagnoses back to back this month, we knew we needed to move home again. We’re moving in with my JY parents (not ideal as we have 3 kids so there will be 7 of us in a 3-bedroom house, but it will work for now) and DH has a part time job lined up that will give him the flexibility to take his mother to appointments and help her at home if needed.

I honestly can’t stand this woman at all and we would be NC if it were up to me. But the kicker is that DH’s father passed away from cancer when he was 2. He has not been able to break ties with his mother because he “can’t handle losing another parent” as he puts it. (He has developed quite a spine over the 12 years of our marriage so we HAVE been very LC with firm boundaries.) I know he needs to be there for her right now and I am fully supportive of his being the one who does most of her appointments and picks up some of the needs at her home. There is a SFIL and a SIL, and they are handling things until our move, but because DH will be the only one without a full time job and because he’s the best at handling stress without a meltdown, I know there will be a lot of weight on my husband’s shoulders. I’m definitely worried about his mental health spending a lot of time in close proximity to his mother. Despite all that I know it would be worse if he sat back and did nothing- his mother having cancer is literally one of his worst nightmares and he’ll only be able to deal with it by being a major cog in her support system. I’m more worried about him than I am about her.

For now I’m doing what I can. I re-followed JNMIL on Facebook to help keep an eye on her mental health (suggestion for FB settings: make it so that I can see a person’s original statuses without having to see any of their shared memes). I’m keeping track of her appointments for the family calendar. I’m trying to educate my kids in age-appropriate ways. And of course I am packing and purging our entire 4 bedroom house so we can fit into a 2 bedroom upper floor plus a 10x10 storage unit. I’m also dealing with the fact that my grandmother has cancer- likely something with a genetic link, not something her lifestyle lead to. I’m definitely feeling overwhelmed by life right now and if anyone can help me get through the next few months I welcome it.",JUSTNOMIL

Psychiatrist appointment went well, although I think the doctor was shocked by what I said. The doctor believes we can tackle these feelings, but that my family is Toxic and, given one of their positions, concerning. First and foremost is escape, which has been the stumbling block for us.

On the other hand, her having access to my profile may give her lots of ammunition to further judge the crap out of DH and I. I don’t really care about it too much, but DH might.

"TW - Mentions of physical and sexual abuse.

&amp;#x200B;

From the ages of 5-14, my mother was involved with a man who gave her two sons, and was physically abusive to myself and the oldest of the sons, and physically and sexually abusive to her. Over the time that they were in a relationship, me talking about the abuse was shut down, ignored and dismissed as me and her partner having a difficult relationship. When I was 14, they split up, an event which involved her travelling to another country for a week and leaving us with him and bringing her new partner back with her. 

&amp;#x200B;

After he left, I was responsible for seeing my brothers off to him every other weekend, despite the fact that seeing him made me incredibly uncomfortable, because he was her ex and she didn't want to. 

&amp;#x200B;

It has recently come out that he has still be abusing both my brothers, and she is finally reporting him to the police. I may have to give a statement. She keeps talking about how she has to do this, and he can never hurt us again. I just want to scream at her that if it weren't for her, he could have never hurt us at all. I know she was abused too, but when I was speaking out about it she silenced me and forced me to interact with him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I can't take it out on her as she is doing her best to make it right now. I just want some advice on how to deal with all the things I am feeling right now. There is a lot of rage and a lot of grief and betrayal.

"A few weeks ago DH and I agreed to spend the memorial day weekend with Beelzebaby and Fil.  Fil's birthday is a couple of days before the holiday and MIL decided that she wanted to do something special for him. She borrowed a friend's cabin out in one of smaller national parks and went about planning every last second of the four day trip.  She invited BIL2 and his new companion, two family friends, AIL and her bf, DH and I, and her mother (heinous bitch), and of course DH's best friends, whom she thinks are her friends.  Please note she only invited her family, cause she hates Fil's family.

&amp;#x200B;

Right from the off I didn't want to go.  The last visit with Beelzebaby was horrible and I ended up looking like the asshole.  AIL and Beelzebaby's mom are notorious FM's so I was afraid they would all team up on me and make my life hell.  I was also worried that being stuck in a cabin in the middle of nowhere would drive us all insane.

&amp;#x200B;

As it turns out I had no reason to worry.  At first everyone RSVPed yes, but then BIL2 remembered he had an important engagement he couldn't miss, DH friend decided to rather attend a wedding than come to Beelzebaby's party and family friend's wife came down with something.  Oh and off course Beelzebaby's mom decided she's too old to travel that far (sob).   Beelzebaby's gathering shrunk to just her and FIL, DH and I, AIL and bf, and one friend.  Beelzebaby was disappointed but who cares.

&amp;#x200B;

DH and I were supposed to go on Friday, but our fur baby got sick so we decided to take her to the vet and only leave on Saturday.  Beelzebaby was pissed.  There was a whole lot of whining, cause we were spoiling her perfect Friday plans, but eventually she realized that she couldn't make us change our minds.  She made us promise to come early the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

So on Saturday, DH and I take our time getting ready.  We get a ton of calls from Beelzebaby and Fil trying to rush us.  One call is Fil telling us not to stop at their house (its on the way to the park) and waste time.  We should just go straight to the cabin.  So that is exactly what we do.  We arrive just after lunch to an empty cabin.  Turns out nobody is there yet.   Not even Beelzebaby and Fil, who kept rushing us.  Of course DH calls them as we get out and FIL immediately tells us that we have to go to the house cause Beelzebaby and AIL is there waiting for us.  They need a ride.  DH was pissed and tells him no.  They could just take AIL's car.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone except Beelzebaby and AIL arrive an hour later and we all settle on the front porch to catch up.  We have a great time until Beelzebaby shows up.  She dampens the entire mood.  She rushes to the kitchen, barely saying hallo and starts making lunch.  I'd already eaten so I decline lunch and you can see Beelzebaby is fuming.  I can even hear her saying a few choice words about me.  She really should learn to whisper when trying to talk behind someone's back.

&amp;#x200B;

After lunch I decide to get something upstairs and Beelzebaby immediately gets in my space.  I notice she is holding  a cheap bar of soap and some hand soap.

&amp;#x200B;

Beelzebaby: ""I got you some soap to use upstairs.""

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""No thank you.  I have my own soap.""

&amp;#x200B;

Beelzebaby: ""Well take it upstairs so DH has something to use.""

&amp;#x200B;

Me:""DH has his own soap.""

&amp;#x200B;

Beelzebaby:  (Looking pissed and huffing) ""Well, just take the hand soap so you have something to wash your hands with.""

&amp;#x200B;

Me:""We already have some upstairs.""

&amp;#x200B;

I walk off and she looks livid. I don't know what she was thinking.  I have terrible allergies and can't use anything except my special brand of soap.  She knows this. A few minutes later, as I come down the stairs, she get in my face again.  

&amp;#x200B;

Beelzebaby:""Here's a towel for DH to use.   Take it upstairs.""

&amp;#x200B;

Me:""DH has his own towel.""

&amp;#x200B;

I sidestep her and she looks super pissed.

&amp;#x200B;

Evening rolls round and I quickly run upstairs to use the bathroom and you won't guess what I find.   Beelzebaby has been in our room.  She has laid out clothes for DH to wear for the next morning.  Not clothes from his suitcase mind.  She brought him new clothes and expects him to wear it. I was so pissed I grabbed it all and tossed in on a chair in the corner, where I later piled the throw pillows.  (As a bit of an aside.  The clothes magically vanished overnight.  No idea what happened to it, but my best guess is that the fashion police confiscated it during the night.  The clothes vanished before DH could even see them.  I'll tell you the rest of this story in part 2.)

&amp;#x200B;

During the evening AIL, her bf and I are really hitting it off and having an amazing chat.  We settle in the living room with blankets (it was a cool night for some reason), while everyone else is out on the back porch barbecuing ribs.  Everyone except Beelzebaby, of course.  She is in the kitchen fussing over every food item and literally ignoring everyone.  She keeps refusing help, dismisses us when we tell her she's preparing too much food and refusing to join every conversation.  This is super awkward seeing as its an open plan kitchen and she is literally 6 feet away from us.  She listens in on all our conversations, but says nothing.  I can see she is pissing people off with her attitude.  

&amp;#x200B;

The next day Beelzebaby had a great big menu planned.  She was pissed when she had to cancel all her plans cause we weren't even able to finish half the food on the previous night. Early morning everyone is sitting on the front porch chatting, but there is no sign of Beelzebaby.  She's wondered off somewhere.   Well she shows up right before brunch demanding that we all go hiking with her.  That's fine with me, cause DH and I were planning to go anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

We set off and from the start its a disaster.  AIL has to turn back after only a few minutes cause she isn't feeling well and its just me, DH and I.  I'm in front setting the pace while Beelzebaby and DH trail behind.  Beelzebaby complained the whole way.  She complained that she couldn't enjoy the scenery cause I was running up hills.  She complained that I was rushing her.  She complained that she didn't' have enough time to take pictures.  Funny thing is I was walking much more slowly than I usually do and I stopped to wait for her multiple times. She was just pissed cause her unfit ass couldn't make it up the hill without constantly stopping.  I was fit and made her look bad and she couldn't deal with it.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to brunch time.  Literally everyone is sitting outside on the front porch enjoying the view and having drinks.  Beelzebaby is in the kitchen playing world's worst/best hostess.  She goes and sets up all the food out back, despite the fact that we are all out front.  She calls us to brunch and I'm up first.  I grab some food and return to everyone at the front.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sitting out front, all alone while the rest grab food, when I hear some Beelzebaby screeching.  I ignore it, but notice that only AIL comes to join me at the front.  I later find out (from DH) that Beelzebaby had a meltdown and guilted everyone to stay at the back, cause sitting in front was messing with her image of the perfect brunch.   

&amp;#x200B;

I also find out that Beelzebaby and AIL had a huge fight.  Turns out while I was sitting at the front and everyone was out back, Beelzebaby pulled AIL to the side and had a fit where she complained about how rude I was not sitting with everyone else.  She called me a bunch of horrible names and said it loudly enough for DH to hear.  

&amp;#x200B;

Guess what guys.   FM AIL stood up for me.  She told Beelzebaby off and told Beelzebaby that I wasn't being the rude one, Beelzebaby was being rude and spoiling our weekend.  She then made a point and came to sit with me, further pissing Beelzebaby off.  Off course DH never showed up to eat with us cause he was giving Beelzebaby a piece of his mind.  Double win.

&amp;#x200B;

After that Beelzebaby stopped acknowledging me at all.  She had CBF whenever looking at me and gave me dirty looks when AIL and I talked about food and exchanged recipes.  She stormed off once when I had fruit for breakfast instead of her food (yes I took my own fruit and had a blast eating it in front of her).  She behaved so badly that everyone was talking about her stupid and rude behavior.  I ended up looking like a angel while she came across as an asshole, especially with her meltdowns whenever things were't going her way.

Stay tuned for part two.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi everyone! Long time lurker, first time poster.  My husband and I met online a few years ago, and in-person in April 2016. He swept me off of my feet, and I love him dearly. He’s also a bit of a momma’s boy. That’s fine by me, usually, but her soul is dark and heavy and she’s the first bully I’ve ever experienced. What gets me the most is that she has never said a bad word to my face but talks crap about me to my husband.  It puts him in an awkward position and pisses me off even more. 

In the first week of meeting in-person, his mother was in sheer disbelief that I had attained my PhD by the age of 30. She’s a nurse practitioner with a Masters degree (fairly recently). She made him take a picture of my degree and my hard-bound thesis to prove it. I thought that was weird af but whatever. Towards the end of my PhD, I had a mental breakdown. I was in and out of mental asylums from 2012-2015. There’s still not a definitive diagnosis, but I have symptoms of disorganized schizophrenia, dissociative identity disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, psychotic depression and anxiety. My psychiatrists have told me that I’m just a highly functioning person with multiple thought disorders. She refuses to believe I have any of these, even though she has never directly talked to me about any of it.

I’ve had trouble finding work in my field (marine science), but I’m optimistic that if I’m patient and determined I will continue my career. Right now I’m a fossil reef park naturalist and I really enjoy the work that I do. I’m not 100%, but I’m also ineligible for any benefits even though I was determined disabled through SSI. So, I am still working and dealing with issues without having meds or therapy. 

However, my MIL is unimpressed that I am trying to use my PhD and keeps telling my husband that I should just apply to Wal-mart or McDonalds and leave my education off of my resume. I don’t get it? I’ve recently interviewed at a university and with NOAA and I’m playing the waiting game to hear back from HR. She thinks I can just walk into these agencies/institutions and get a job, and doesn’t believe me or care to understand that they are lengthy processes. The naturalist position that I have is seasonal, just above minimum wage and does not offer benefits. But, I’m learning so much about reef paleoecology, and I really enjoy it. She seems to think that I should just throw in the towel on my career and that I should get off of my pedestal? I’m literally one of the most humble people you could meet. I was homeless and in and out of asylums while finishing my thesis. I don’t push my title in people’s faces, and most people I meet don’t even know I’m a doctor. Plus, I volunteer regularly to help students who think they may want a career in STEAM.

I just don’t get it. I’m trying. Honestly, I am so proud of myself for even having regained coherency and awareness. I was truly lost within myself for many years. Its really strange that my MIL disbelieves I have any issues, because she is a nurse practitioner and her daughter is also a schizophrenic. I actually think she may have a lot of bias about what to expect from dealing with her daughter? I don’t even think we have the same subtype of the illness. And what irks me the most is she has gotten upset with me because I mark applications as having a disability, because she used to be a hiring manager and told me that she always threw those applications away. I’ve seriously thought about turning her in for discrimination for this, and my husband is probably the only thing that’s really stopped me. 

I don’t know I feel like I could just keep going. There’s so much more crap of hers I’ve dealt with, but the underlying core issue seems to be that I have my doctorate and for whatever reason she doesn’t want me to use it. 

Any advice appreciated. I’m about a stone’s throw away from giving up on any kind of relationship with her.",JUSTNOMIL
"So I am a new user,  and I do mention pregnancy loss later on hence the trigger warning. This might be pretty long and I am on mobile so please bear with me.

For a little backstory:
Me and my fiance grew up together and my mom and my future MIL (I'll call her Red from here on) were pretty close friends before we moved and they grew apart.

Me and Fiance reconnected my senior year of highschool when he took me to my senior prom after a bad breakup with my asshat ex just before.  We had a magical night and I fell right then and there, as did he.  I was 17 and he was 18.

After we told our parents we were together my parents were estatic! They loved Fiance like a son already and knew that he was loyal and respectful to me, and they believed us when we said we loved each other. My parents married as teenagers so they are more understanding and supportive so long as we are mature and responsible about it. 

FIL was pretty neutral, if his son was happy, he was happy. But Red.... was more unsure. She cornered Fiance later after they returned home and interrogated him if he was sure, ""she's nice and all but are you suurrreee about her?"", ""she's out there and you're not"", ""she's outgoing and friendly and you're too introverted to be compatible"". 

Fiance defended me and said that he genuinely wants to be with me and if it doesn't work out fine, but he wasn't going to go into it thinking negatively. 

Time passes and Red seemed to warm up to the idea more (with some serious ass kissing) but as me and Fiance's relationship strengthened the more fiercely I defended it and him.

 Red would always put down Fiance, nit pick and remind him of every shortcoming and character flaw he possessed. And it pissed me off. I started standing up to her and telling her to knock it off as it was mean and not helping him at all. Fiance was more shy and had lower self esteem so her jabs just made him more introverted.

Add onto that, she bought him a nice mustang (side note: Fiance doesn't even like mustang's and was saving to get an old Camaro that he really wanted) . Which sounds nice, but she traded in his old car and took out a loan to buy it. It was a ""gift"" but he had to make all the payments. Her credit was so bad that the payments are $600 a month! And now thanks to this ""gift"" Fiance had to work overtime at his low paying retail job to keep it, leaving him no money for himself or to go out with me. I had to give him money often just so he could buy himself lunch while he was working. (Remember we are just teens at this point)

I lost my virginity to him when I turned 18, I knew he was the one and I wanted my first time to be with him. My mom knew before hand what I was planning to do and she respected my decision and reminded me that this is something special and I can change my mind if I am uncomfortable and he will understand. 

It happened and was special to me. Later that same month, both families met up for a birthday party. During the party Red told my mom that we were having sex and made me out to be a dirty girl that corrupted her son. My mom was pissed and said the truth that we had planned it and that it wasn't something dirty, it was beautiful. And that it shouldn't be something to be gossiped about since it was between me and Fiance.

Fast forward through years of petty drama and snide remarks,
I am at college living in an apartment with my roommate and Fiance is still at home because he cant afford to leave due to him still paying on the mustang. 

Of course when one is having sex, you run the risk of becoming pregnant. And that's what happened. I didn't realize at first and thought I was just sick, but when the test came back positive,  I was so excited. This was earlier than I planned, but a baby is a miracle since I have a condition that makes it very very very hard to become pregnant.... 

Unfortunately,  one night, my stomach hurt so bad, i thought i was dying... i wont go into too much details but i had a very bad miscarriage. My mother felt my pain as she has the same condition and miscarried several pregnancies. 

I told Fiance about the pregnancy and the miscarriage and we spent the night grieving the loss of our first child.

This is where Red went from annoyance to B**** She questioned me if I ever was pregnant to begin with and I didn't know what I was talking about (ignoring that I had it confirmed at the doctor). This hurt so much more than I thought it could.

After this EVERY SINGLE THING was questioned. Me and Fiance getting engaged, me helping him become more financially responsible, us getting our own apartment... Every conversation was he questioning all of our life decisions. 

On Dia de Los Muertos, me and fiance made an altar ( I'm hispanic) and on it we had a teddy bear, baby shoes, and a sign that said the name we chose for the baby. Although it was too early to know the gender, we decided to name them so we could remember them and add them to the altar. 

Red saw the altar and cornered me, asking about it. I thought she was interested in the holiday, but she was just upset about the fact we had one for a baby that didn't exist and why we chose the name of HER son. She just went on and on about how my pregnancy wasn't real and it never happened. 

Recently on mother's day, Fiance went to visit but I didn't want to. I was sick and don't like her anyways. He told Red that he couldn't stay too long because he wanted to spend some time with me today too since he knew this was an emotional day for me.

Red guilted him and made sure that he was there as long as possible, dragging everything out. He didn't get home until late in the evening.


Am I overreacting? She questions everything I do, everything I say, and even my pregnancy?! She actively tries to convince Fiance that I'm not the one and that I'm abusive? (She actually said that to him) 

It's just ridiculous, we aren't even married yet and it's already an issue.

"**Relevant background**

* MIL had literal brain surgery about ten years before DH and I met, she continues to live with chronic pain which is managed through a combination of special hearing aids that filter out a lot of noise, cannabis oil, opiates, and a generally quiet/low stress lifestyle because stress is the major trigger for her headaches/pain. 

* To my understanding, MIL has never been a super emotionally stable person. For this reason, while DH has maintained a relationship with her, for as long as he’s been an adult it has been a relationship moderated by limited information, safe topics of conversation, and visiting for a few hours on a monthly basis.

* When she’s not totally stressed out about something or trying to steer conversation towards topics that are entirely inappropriate to discuss with her, MIL is a lovely person. We generally get on reasonably well (due in large part to my refusing to engage in anything that smells emotionally charged or like a fight, avoiding one on one time, leaving my husband to handle the bulk of communication when we’re not visiting them, and trying to make a point of reassuring her that she is loved and we intend to continue including her in our family whenever she decides she’s being cut out.) DH has commented with some frequency over our relationship that I get along with MIL better than anyone else in the family.

So DH and I volunteer with our local Scouting group. As part of this we were given the date of a special overnight trip a little over a year ago. MIL has been begging for a sleepover with DD (now a year and a half old) since she was like 3 months old. When we became aware of this particular trip for Scouts we had suggested to MIL that it would be a good opportunity for that first sleepover. She was over the moon and assured us that she’d definitely do it.

Fast forward 10 months. Things are mostly good. There’s the occasional hiccup, but everyone is playing nicely together. MIL has babysat for us in the evenings when we’ve visited her so we could go for a date or to visit other friends/family who live in her town. She’s come to our place a few times to babysit during the day and spent a few days with us here a few times. 

She adores DD. More importantly, DD adores her. She lets DD have more screen time than I’d like when they’re hanging out, but I figure it’s better for them to bond over puppy videos on YouTube and that be their thing than for me to fight that particular battle. And they definitely do other things as well like read all the stories and colour and build with blocks. MIL knows the bedtime routine, DD has enough words that she’s actually pretty easy to keep happy as long as you listen to what she’s mispronouncing, look where she’s pointing, and remember to feed her at the designated times. Hanger is an intense emotion but easily avoided by adherence to the routine. 

MIL asks about the sleepover thing again. We bring up the Scouts trip and give her the date for it again. MIL is pleased and talks about how much fun it will be and asks about whether it would be her coming to our place or us dropping DD off at hers. We tell her she’d need to come to ours because there’s already a lot of driving for this trip and dropping DD off at her place will add 4 hours of travel both days and just be too much for us. I promise I’ll leave dinner prepared for her and DD in the fridge and it’ll be something simple that just needs to be put in the oven to heat up, she comments on how that would be so good and if I have time she really enjoyed the lasagna I made when she visited in MONTH.

Fast forward another month. The sleepover is discussed again, pretty much the same conversation, MIL is stoked to have a sleepover.

So then the last time we all went down to visit, probably a week after that conversation? We put DD to bed at MIL’s and with her blessing left for BIL’s (10 minute drive away) to visit them for a bit. We fully expected MIL and FIL to go to bed at their usual time and for everyone in the house to be asleep when we got back. 

Less than an hour after we left (my tea was still steeping) we both got a text letting us know that MIL had a headache and was going to take her medicine and go to bed early. DH texts back about how that sounds good, we hope she gets a good sleep and is feeling better in the morning, and no we won’t be late. 

Things we say to each other but do not text: We are not concerned about her needing to take her medicine and go to bed because a) DD sleeps through the night 99% of the time b) FIL (who is an absolute gem and the definition of stability) is also there and perfectly capable of soothing DD if for some reason this is the one night she does wake up (Spoiler: she didn’t.) and c) we are less than a ten minute drive away and can come immediately if something comes up that FIL doesn’t think he can handle. 

MIL then phones in tears. She is upset that we’re not taking her concerns seriously and she’s just not comfortable with being responsible for DD when she’s taken the opiates, and she wants us to come back right now. (And fair enough, I also don’t want her responsible when the opiates are in the picture, but FIL is there so there’s still a responsible adult.)

DH, sensing the probability of this escalating in a big way if we don’t do as MIL has asked, tells her we are on the way. He fills BIL and his wife in on the situation and we make our apologies for cutting the visit so short. BIL and his wife understand, they have a similar approach to us for managing MIL but with more frequent and shorter visits.

MIL has already gone to bed when we get there. FIL is brushing his teeth and thanks us for coming back. DD is sound asleep.

The next morning was Mother’s Day, so I slept in and DH got up with DD. DH described things as tense first thing because MIL kept wanting to talk about the previous night. He smoothed things over, everything seemed good by the time I wandered upstairs for tea. Rest of the visit was uneventful.

So then this week, MIL calls wanting to come babysit since I have an appointment today. We shot that down because DH would be working like usual and while my appointment was in the city and expected to require most of the day to get to and from, I had scheduled it so as far as childcare was concerned it would be like a normal workday with my possibly picking DD up 15-20 minutes later than usual from the dayhome. We pay for a full time space so whether she goes or not we pay the same. We mention how they’re welcome to come down early on Saturday or even Friday night if they want to get some visiting in with us before we leave for the overnight trip, and we hope they’ll stay for supper Sunday when we get back even if we just order Chinese or pizza or something. That all sounds good. 

Yesterday, BIL2 calls to invite us to the baptisms happening on Sunday for nephews. DH explains that we’ve been committed to this Scouts trip for a year now and if we don’t go there’s 12 extremely disappointed kids who also don’t get to go. BIL2 understands, comments that it’s pretty short notice and he was supposed to invite us months ago. 

MIL calls shortly after to ask what time we’re coming down for the baptisms this weekend. DH explains that we can’t go because of the Scouts trip, and aren’t she and FIL coming to babysit?

No. Turns out they’re not. She never actually wrote it down on the calendar and now she’s promised to be at the baptisms. But she can still babysit if we drive DD to her and pick her up (again, adding 4 hours of travel time to each day for us.)

So we’ve mostly figured out how to handle the overnight trip. My sister and her fiancé and their son are flying out of the city our overnight trip is in first thing Monday morning for my sibling’s wedding next weekend. They were already planning to spend Sunday night and when I explained the situation to my sister she offered for them to come to the city a day early and for DD to spend Saturday night and Sunday morning with them. DH and I can Rock Paper Scissors for who rides the bus with the kids and other leaders and the winner will drive our car and DD to the city and deliver her and the car seat to my sister before joining the group, I’ll e-transfer my sister the money for the hotel etc. ... everything will be ok. It’s been a crazy stressful day figuring out an alternate babysitting plan since MIL bailed and we don’t have anyone else in our town who knows DD well enough for an overnight and this trip is definitely not one that we can just bring DD on, but we figured it out.

I’m trying to look on the bright side. At least we found out she wasn’t coming a few days before the trip and had time to make alternate arrangements. Thankfully it lines up well with my sister’s travel plans. 

But I mean really. This has been on the calendar for a year now. We have talked about it almost every time we’ve seen her for the last few months!",JUSTNOMIL
"Trigger Warning - Rape Mention

This is flaired No advice wanted, because I couldn't find a flair that says Update - Trigger Warning 

Another day, another shitshow.  As it turns out some people refuse to learn, anything.  

My brother belongs to a cult much like my parents, but because the pastor is a different person, some of their beliefs differ.  Such as dress standards and what exactly constitutes a sin.  So apparently the church people got their C&amp;D letters just in time for Wednesday night service. Where they apparently shared the letters, and my email address amongst both congregations. My attorney hasn't gotten the certified mail return receipts yet, but probably will in the next day or so.   So, apparently we are dealing with a group of geniuses.  Now into the latest saga of PH lighting herself on fire in order to be a martyr.

None of the original 14 C&amp;D letter receivers contacted me and of the new batch only 6 have so far made the mistake of mentioning OS, PH or edad.  The mentions were horrible and so my attorney is headed to court tomorrow to file contempt charges.

Here are the mentions:

Brother's pastor:  You are a disgrace to the last name ********.  It is obvious that you were adopted from a trashy whore because the genetics have shown through.  You have thrown away all the godly traits your parents tried to instill in you to become trash like your biological family.  Instead of being grateful for what you were given you have blasphemed against god.  You are going to hell unless you repent and beg for his forgiveness.  Your parents are true examples of what a christian should be and when they die, you will be at their graves on you hands and knees begging for their forgiveness, but it will be too late.

Brother's Pastor's Wife:  You can try to use the courts to try and control your family, but god will stop you. You need to pray for forgiveness and stop with the court nonsense. PH and edad are good people who will forgive you for your slanderous claims against them.

Busybody 1a: I remember when you lied about Brother !#$;#% raping you and you tried to ruin his career, now you are doing the same thing with your parents.

Busybody 2a: You have tried to destroy OS's life, your brother has told us everything you accused him of, but god's ways are not your ways so you will not prevail.

The other two messages say the same stuff just turned a little different.  The nice thing is that these people took the time to write out these awful things.  

The nice thing is that they all sent these messages to me during church hours, so they probably used the church's Wi-Fi.  Now, my parent's church is in a rented storefront, they have no assets to speak of.  My brother's church is a mini-mega church.  They own properties, have assets and a board.  My attorney has plans to trace the IP addresses back to the church and file some lawsuits.  I don't know on what grounds as we discussed this after hours but I'm sure he'll figure it out.

"Hey guys. 
My wife and I had a baby in November 2018 and due to financial reasons, moved in to wife's parents' house. Wife is a part time teacher and I am currently in nursing school (graduating in January 2020). The in laws, particularly the MIL helps a bunch with babysitting while we are at work/school and we are very grateful for that and we express it to her as much as we can. 

Recently our son, who is 6 months now, has been sick with colds and middle ear infections so things have started to become a little bumpy. Things between my wife and her parents that have been tucked away have been starting to resurface and we are starting to notice that my wife's parents are pretty selfish. 

For example, our son has had a fever for the past few days and have been in and out of the pediatrician's office since last week. Obviously, children get sick especially when they are very young and theres no way to prevent it. My wife and my goal is to keep him comfortable and happy while the cold runs its course. However my MIL and her husband have been passive aggressively blaming us for the baby getting sick. 

They say that we shouldn't take him out to see friends and that we should always keep him bundled up (in May). They also blame our dogs for him getting sick (we have two dogs that our son loves to play with). My brothers wedding is coming up and they told my wife that we shouldn't bring our son because he is going to get sicker so my wife simply said that we are going to take him and that he will be comfortable because he is with both parents. After my wife said that, her father kind of blew up on her and said that ""theres no use in talking to you"" and that ""it's better to not even see you."" This was at 6:30 in the morning. 

My wife has been dealing with anxiety issues since the birth and she has been in a slump these past few weeks especially because our son has been sick and we haven't had much sleep. I advised her to talk to her parents because it seems like they havent been very supportive of her emotionally or mentally, so she did. 

But my MILs response to her was only defensive saying that she never make her feel that way (...?) And that she (MIL) is upset and stressed put because our son has been sick recently. 

Now, my wife is saying that she gives up on trying to talk to her parents. Her anxiety has been even worse, and now it is so awkward for me to even be at the same house as them.

Our plan is (and has been) to move out as soon as we are ready. But it might be another few years before that can happen. 

Please give some advice on how to deal with this situation and situations like these. Thank you guys.",JUSTNOMIL
"So I guess I’ll preface this by saying I’m currently 5 months pregnant and feeling extra hormonal, but I’m truly starting to resent my MIL. 
My DH and I rent a house from her and she has the habit of dropping by unannounced, and has been doing so for the past 3 years. My DH has told her multiple times before to please call or text beforehand and she’ll listen for a month and then go right back to coming over unannounced. She did it again today while my husband was at work and when I told him, his response was, “ she’s just trying to be nice and help out since you’re pregnant.” Aaaand of course a huge fight followed because although I definitely appreciate the help, I think it’s still incredibly rude to come over to someone’s house unannounced and uninvited. It’s all built up from many different times where this has happened: letting herself back in after she said she was leaving which means she caught me taking a crap in the bathroom with my pants off, coming over and my house is messier than i’d have it if I knew a guest was coming (so then she proceeded to clean the house after I keep insisting to NO PLEASE STOP—-I have a 3 year old there’s going to be toys scattered pretty much any time, on any given day. She tells me all the time how tired I look, tries to undermine me in front of my daughter, took it upon herself to make a budget for my wedding, call caterers and create the menu for the day with ZERO input from me or DH (def put my foot down there), last week took my daughter somewhere after school without telling me where they were, ugh just many little things that have added up over the years.
Anyway I don’t know if the boundaries are blurred because it’s “technically” her house and we’re just renting or what but I’m so fed up with it. And any time I bring up these things to DH he gets really defensive of her actions.

That I'm going to go after him for child support for my older children (not his kids) is that even something people really try? My older kids have a dad.... He takes care of them. And called me some nasty names because I have a tattoo and multiple ear piercings. BF is a huge mama's boy and take everything that comes out of her mouth as gospel.

So moving on to the current situation. I got an IUD but something happened and I am now 7 months pregnant. I told BF on Christmas day and against my wishes he immediately told his mother who's response was ""well that's one way to get a man"". For almost a month BF and his mother tried to force me to have an abortion, when they realized that wasn't going to happen they moved into Adoption which I considered for a hot minute. But neither option is one I can live with. I laid down and made this baby. It is my responsibility and choice to raise it. I repeatedly told him over this time period that if he wanted out he was free to go. We didn't plan this and he needed to make his choice on what he wants to do. He chose to stay to avoid looking like a sh!t head (his words not mine). Fast forward through lots of fighting and arguments about how I'm a horrible human being for making this choice against his demands(the abortion, yes he said this) and I'm wrong on everything I do or decide or what I choose not to share outside of him and I.

His mother has now become very demanding for all info about baby including my medical records, every thing Dr says at appointments, which tests I have to have including the very expensive NIPT test she demanded I do with an offer to help pay the bill until she saw the actual bill and said no she's not helping with that after all so now I have this $1035 bill I have to figure out how to pay on my own.

The mother and her husband came for a visit in February (they live in another state). It started out with little snide comments under her breath about what I'm doing wrong and something about coming early which I didn't understand at the time. Saturday night they start talking about when they will come down when baby is born and his mother says they will come down at the end of July (baby due mid August) and stay for two weeks after baby is born to ""help out"". Keep in mind this woman couldn't even get off her a$$ to get herself a piece of candy out of the fridge last weekend. I doubt she'll be here to actually help unless it is to baby hog so I can cater to them while they visit

Sunday morning we sit down at the dining room table and I bring up the discussion about not wanting long term visitors at the end of my pregnancy or during recovery and it blew up!! She was in my face literally two inches from my face yelling and telling me that as Grandma she will do what she wants, this is not my decision she will be here to ""serve"" me and that what I want doesn't matter. The first round got to the point that I stood up, told her if she can't respect what I want then she won't see this child and I walked off to get dressed and leave. No I wasn't very nice but I don't take being pushed around lightly.

I came back into the kitchen and she started in on me again. This whole time BF hasn't backed me up once. Turns out he invited her to stay that long without talking to me She wouldn't listen but told me what she wants and what she expects to happen. So here's her list. In high volume in my face with no regard to me asking her to back off.

1. I plan to EBF. She says I can pump and they'll feed the baby
2. She will be here to take care of the baby to let me recover without worrying about a little thing like my child.
3. She will be taking my baby out of state for weeks at a time starting in the first year and at her descretion.
4. This is a family situation which means what she wants is the only thing that matters when it comes to my baby.
5. She will be here, in the hospital to see her grandson born.

Nothing here about me or what I need. I'm just an incubator...

BF is totally on board with everything his mom wants and I'm the bad guy for wanting to put boundaries in place and asking that my wishes for this pregnancy/delivery be meet. All I want is peace and privacy to rest recover and bond with my baby.

BF told me last night that if I don't play nice and do what his mom wants then he will leave. That I can raise this baby on my own cause he won't be involved with out Mommy dearest. He says he'll try counciling with me but had already stated that it won't work. He also stated that until I get my act together he will not be helping with any baby related purchases/bills.

I refuse everything she wants at this point to the extreme Max extent. She can shove it up her ass as none of this is about her.

So, they will be here in a week for a ""visit"". Her plan was to do my nursery because that's her right. I managed to get everything set up and ready this week so she is SOL there but it's going to be a fight and I need help with which boundaries to set and how to get bf and his mom to stick to them. 

BF is still very much attached by the cord with his Jocasta mom and had stated multiple times that he'll take her advice and do whatever he wants with my baby (advice that is 50 years old and dangerous-like putting baby on his tummy to sleep). 

I have a pretty shiny back bone and I'll stick up for myself and baby but it's been a long fight and I just need some back up to know I'm not wrong. If you think IATA please tell me that too!!!

Thanks everyone",JUSTNOMIL
"My mom babysits my 2 kids a few days a week. DS just turned 1, and I was going over with my mom about how we had transitioned him from formula. 

Me: he's not drinking formula at all anymore. You'll need to give him milk in a sippy cup. 

Mom: I want to take them to the park all day. 

Me: if you're at the park, you're fine to give him water if you need to. But primarily he needs to be drinking milk. 

Mom: what about juice?

Me: no. Milk, water only if you have to. 

Mom: why not juice?

Me: it's just sugary and has no nutritional value. 

Mom: what about pedialyte water?

Me: no. Milk or water.

Mom: what if I buy the pedilyte?

Me: no! Milk or water!

Mom: can he have flavored water?

Me: no! Regular water! And that's only if you're out and dont have milk. He needs to primarily be drinking milk.

Mom: why milk?

DH: (who just walked in for the end of this) because he needs to be drinking milk. 

Mom: oh, ok. No problem. 

And she walks off, leaving me in a rage about milk for the rest of the day.. it drives me nuts that she will argue with me for 5 minutes about it, but when my DH says the same thing, its fine.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hello ! I’m Very new to reddit but in desperate need of some insight. Please bare with me I’m trying to stay within guidelines. My Bf and I were talking about giving my mom a monetary gift for watching my daughter at night while I work. Not that she’s asked but because she’s so amazing I’d like to help her as well.. So he goes and asks his mother her opinion about how much money would be acceptable to watch the baby. She goes on to say “ I’m not accepting money to watch my granddaughter over and over “ clearly not understanding the money is just a gift not a necessity. So I begin to talk to my Bf about my plans with helping my mother since she’s been off work helping my schizophrenic brother. I’m going to work overnight most likely so the baby will probably not even realize I’m not there. His mother BUTTS in and begins to say how I’m not thinking realistically and how my mother needs sleep and how mothers will pile up their plate until there on their last straw.. Once again not her place.. so I’m telling my BF well I need to help my mom and my brother. SHE SAYS. “ YOU CANT HELP YOUR BROTHER “ I LOST IT ! I say to her you live with your sister right ? You help your sister so it’s imperative that I do the same. Now I won’t lie 4 years of doing this with this lady I was fed up !! She’s terrorized me ! ( She’s thrown me out of her house. Went on screaming rants kicking the door while I slept in the room with her son. She’s kicked me out her house pregnant. She’s also blamed me for her son not being famous. She’s accused me of cutting myself. And was generally unsupportive of my pregnancy. Saying she wished her son hadn’t gotten me pregnant because her bloodline would be polluted. Shes also kicked me , her son &amp; my daughter out before. So I may have said the part about the sister a little hostile. She comes around the couch and gets in my face snarling saying I did not say nothing about your brother repetitively. SO steps in saying his mother is out of line and she argues with him saying no she’s not. So once again I’m not saying anything trying to remain calm she somehow ends up walking up to me again screaming in my face. I begin backing up I begin to tell her son “ get your mother get your mother “ He intervenes again. She slams doors * while my daughter sleeps * walking in and out the room throwing stuff calling me b*tches and talking loudly about me to her sister on the phone. I’m ignoring her calmly speaking to my SO but it continues her an hour her pacing back and forth throwing things and cursing and saying “ MY GOD “ I would have never. I walked into the living room talking to my mother on the phone explaining her threatening behavior she gets up off her bed ( couch ) and stands up in my face while I’m talking to my mother saying I’m disrespectful and how I’m a b*tch. Long story shorter won’t say short lmao.. I end up telling her how she doesn’t respect or care about anyone but her son. ( PS she worked for a fancy club and used to spit in the rich peoples tea and lick their lemons ) She begins to say you don’t ever have to step foot in here again. I say “ and my daughter won’t either “ I promise. She says yes she will I say ok. She follows me into the room while I speak to my mother on the phone and is pointing in my face while she speaks to her sister. I proceed to say YOU DONT DO ANYTHING FOR MY DAUGHTER ANYWAY YOU BOUGHT 4 NB outfits and that’s it. SO SHES IN THE ROOM TALKING LOUDLY WHILE MY DAUGHTER SLEEPS. I just change the subject while on the phone with my mom and proceed to ask my bf if he’s okay because he’s crying and shaking. He says this wasn’t how it was supposed to be so I tell him it’s ok.. It was gonna happen anyway. She also said shes gonna have my daughter anyway I said no tf you not I told her that I mentioned that she was being recorded whether admissible or not and it is evidence of her hostility towards me and evidence of you putting my baby out as well. She’s threatened grandparents rights before.. and she also threatened them that day as well. But despite her disposition I also managed to say your not getting any rights you smoke weed majority of your day and I don’t want weed around my child. So I am NC at this point but Now I’m dealing with guilt.. I feel alone. Despite him defending me gently. I still feel like overall I’m the only person looked at with fault when in fact I was antagonized for years.. SO still lives with her so in fact there aren’t any real reprecussions. Everything resumes as normal for them.. so I don’t know how to feel.. Can someone share some insight as to what they’d do ? Or some encouragement.. Something please.",JUSTNOMIL
"So yesterday was my birthday, and this is important because SO is now FD(ear)H.  With this, comes the question of how I should tell Staples and the rest of family.

I already know I'm throwing Staples under the bus if extended family asks why they haven't met him - FDH doesn't drive, and Staples refused to drive him to any events with family.  Which won'y endear her side to family.

Now, I was thinking of telling family when I move out.  Something along the lines of ""I would rather live with my fiancé than family"".  Boyfriend (poly relationships) suggested asking if they'll help pay for the wedding, since Staples isn't paying my schooling in preference for my sister's wedding.  Girlfriend just laughed at his suggestion.

So, advice on how to tell Staples?",JUSTNOMIL
"So I know this comes from a place of love and excitement but it's just too much - thankfully DH has agreed to polish his spine and deal with it, but I've been asking for weeks prior to this latest incident and he hasn't done it yet.   


DH and I were secretly trying for a baby for over two years, and we only told our families when we decided to try IVF. Luckily for us, we fell first round and I'm now 16 weeks pregnant. Because our families knew we were undergoing IVF, they've known since I was four weeks.   


""Normally YMIL"", who can sometimes be a little much with her opinions but is usually lovely, has been buying things without my knowledge or consent for the baby - I mean, okay, it's her first (biological) grandchild, but I've always been uncomfortable with her taste so I'm wary of what she's bought. She constantly pestered me to go baby shopping, has asked for weekly updates on things I like, rundowns of how appointments go, etc., all of which I've obliged as I've got no problem with her being involved. However, I've since found out she's been whinging to DH that I've been cutting her out of the baby stuff as I end the conversations if I'm feeling overwhelmed and she's offended that I don't like the things she's picked out. DH told me off for not being nicer to her about the whole thing, but he shut up pretty quick when I pointed that both of my JYParents have barely had the opportunity to be involved because she's been buying everything and getting in my face about everything baby related. I told him that I needed him to tell her to calm down because it was all too much and it was starting to cause anxiety attacks for me.   


Cue last night, when I get a call from one of my BFFs letting me know NormYMIL had put our close friends and family into a facebook chat, ceremoniously named ""Baby Skittles Shopping Spree!!!!!"", about two weeks ago.   


Apparently she listed out everything she's bought, what 'we still need' and who should buy it, photos of the paint chips we had picked out for the nursery (not decided) and games for the baby shower.   


BFF was appropriately confused as she's responsible for organising our ""new parents' family BBQ"" in lieu of a traditional baby shower (no structured, gendered parties here) and is expecting a COMPLETELY OPTIONAL baby registry list from me. She, like most of my family and friends, also understands that I'm morally against forced gift-giving and am particular about the things I bring into my home.   


I've told DH, and now he's having anxiety attacks because he feels the same as me, but he's the one who has to talk to her (because if I do it I'll rip her a new one despite her actions coming from a place of love.)  


Hopefully we can get this sorted peacefully, and soon.   


TL:DR; NormYMIL is upset she's not more involved in our pregnancy, despite being most involved behind DH and I, and has started overdoing it.",JUSTNOMIL
"Long time no see my fellow Reddit folks! It has been a while since my last post! I apologize in advance for the lenghty post.

For those that have been along the ride, DH and I just came from an extended vacation. It was amazing! DH jumped right into the whole experience and enjoyed it beyond words. However, there were some flare ups of mental issues I have that somehow put a damper on the whole thing.

I gotta be honest here: I have some serious self image and self esteem problems. Mainly due to my upbringing with STR, my JNDad and the delightful religious cult I was raised in. So... Yay... 

These issues are mainly focused on my body. I am overweight and I feel that I am the ugliest person alive. DH is wonderful and whenever I have a meltdown, he is constantly encouraging me and telling me how beautiful I am to him. I have joined the gym, however the main issue I have revolves around food. Spare the Rod used to constantly micromanage everytime I ate the moment I hit puberty. Whenever I ate, she would constantly bombard me with questions and judge  me: ""are you eating AGAIN?"", ""Don't eat that, you should eat a salad, or fruit instead of a sandwich"",  ""You look fatter"", ""Your thighs are getting bigger"", etc etc etc.. 

Being the rebellious teenager I was, I would eat just to spite her and then cry quietly on my room. I would also start eating junk food whenever I had the chance to be outside my house, specially when I started working. She would pester me to work out, so I developed an aversion to any physical activity, since she would demand to supervise me to make sure I wasn't wearing any provocative clothing to work out. When I did finally go out to work out (taking a walk, jogging, etc) and I would complain that I was being catcalled (which happens a lot in my country), she would blame me for wearing tights and say that I should wear a hoodie and shapeless clothes. See where this is going?

Anyway, these situations added to the fact that I had an accident 6 years ago and it damaged my spine and my knees and that my job is very passive, let me to currently weight 95kg and at my height of 164 cm, I am a nicely rounded potato. I started having some health issues which led me to start working out at my local gym and I am attempting to eat healthier. I know is a slow process and I won't give up, but I still have mental breakdowns and they flared up on our trip. 

We went to an asian country where it is extremely uncommon for women to be overweight. While staying a my friend's house during our last week there, she mentioned she was constantly checking the people around us in order to make sure nobody was making comments about my size and that nobody was trying to take pictures of me. I immediately froze and felt a stone drop to my stomach. I am aware I am bigger than most women there, but hearing her say it and launch into a list of situations that have happened to other friends of hers while visiting basically soured my mood and made me feel extremely self conscious and paranoid. She then started commenting on all the meals about how I needed to eat more salad and stop eating certain foods. This triggered an immediate flashback and I started tearing up while attempting to appear that everything is fine.

After we arrived back home, DH and I had a conversation about it. He was honest with me and said he feels I should go to therapy. He also said that the self image issues I have are not only related to my external image, but also with my perception of myself and that I should get help so I can start healing. I agreed. I have been having some split-second thoughts that scare me, the latest being while I was on an uber going 70km/h on a highway and I just had the impulse of just opening the door and jumping off the moving car. 

I gotta be honest, this terrifies me. I don't consider myself suicidal. I had some self harm episodes when I was a teenager, but right now my life is in a whole better place. I am going to search for a psychologist because I want to get better, however I am afraid that it will eventually require for me to confront Spare the Rod and I am not sure I have the strength to deal with the rug sweeping, DARVO and fallout from her.

Any advice is appreciated.

EDIT: Thank you for all the comments and support! I now understand that the thoughts I have been having are not as scary as I thought. I am still searching for a therapist and I will update as time goes on",JUSTNOMIL
"Inspired by yesterdays post about JNMIL's trying to name their grandchildren. That post sparked an old memory for me, and although it wasn't actually that long ago, it somehow feels that way with everything that's happened since. 

Anyhow, on to the story. At about the 6 month mark of the pregnancy, when everything just became so real, MIL started pestering us with baby name suggestions constantly. My wife fielded the majority of these conversations, so I didn't really hear even half of them. But what I did hear started to annoy me. However, I wrote it off as ""grandma's just excited for the birth of this baby"", and tried to let it go. 

In the last month of pregnancy, she cranked it up a few notches, realizing we hadn't chosen a name yet, and hoping we'd go with one of the hundreds of names she'd thrown at us. It's a JustNoSO issue, so I won't get into why, but my wife started to echo a few of the names her mom was suggesting for our baby. I knew they were from her mom because she would sometimes tell me they were, and because they were also names derived from her family's ethnic background. Because I knew where they were coming from, I refused to even consider any of the names. 
I shut down on the naming thing right up until birth. That didn't stop the suggestions from rolling in though. So damn irritating!

Our baby was born right on schedule, and after a long day of labour, we had our DS. Everybody wanted to know what name we chose, but since we hadn't chose one yet, we just called him baby. We had about 48 hours to pick one, as the hospital doesn't allow you to leave until baby has a name. Early the next morning, MIL and FIL burst into the room in a flurry of....whatever you want to call it....excitement, I suppose. 

By this point, we had picked a name. A full name at that; first, middle and last. Paperwork was done and submitted. No take backs! I was happy with what we chose, and I also knew it in no way resembled any name MIL had suggested. 

""Does he have a name yet??? What's his naaaaaaame? What's our baby's name???"". (note that she said ""our baby"" and not your baby. This woman has never referred to my son as my child, always either ""hers"" or ""ours"") I seriously didn't even have a chance to greet them, or say anything really; it was the MIL show. Before either of us could respond, she said ""Did you pick (insert name MIL wanted us to use)?"". I couldn't even control my reaction...

My face must have turned pretty sour, but I kept my cool, and as coldly as I could, simply said ""No, it wasn't considered"". It's hard to convey in words, but every ounce of my derision was put into that one little sentence. She felt it, and I know she did because she had a shocked look, followed soon after by CFB. Unfortunately, her silence didn't last too long, and she went back to being loud, aggressive and irritating. 

She never brought up the name thing again, and I believe she got the message. I know there will be another baby down the road, because I want another someday, and my wife desperately wants to be pregnant already. When that day comes, I imagine MIL will be slightly more covert in her naming attempts, and I know I will need to pay close attention. 

Edit: apologies for the typo in the header. Mean to say ""our"".",JUSTNOMIL
"Alright good folks of Reddit. My great MIL have made another move today in her web of plots and frankly I'm at a loss to what I should do. Should I go ham , unleash my anger and confront her BS or should I play a more subtle long time  game like her . 


Back story in short summary , she is a train wreck who I have no idea if she hates my guts but she certainly acts as if she does. She was the one who married me to her son after I got pregnant , I was fine just doing my own shit  , but she insisted .  Now she's going around saying I trapped him and how I married I married forcefully ? ( He was a casual date , broke and I was already breaking up with him he was the one who kept pulling me back , I have legit zero good reasons to do this. Even if I was that type he's the last person a gold digger would go for . Hell I'm the one who's been financing me , my kid and him  mainly despite not having an income or a job for fucks sake  ) . When I was organising the marriage , a simple signing , she came crying to me saying she felt left out and to give her responsibility over things so I let her chose what she want to do. She took the task of organising and procuring two witnesses necessary for the wedding and for the baby's birth preparations / hospital fees . A bunch of shit happened and basically she abandoned both tasks , did shit all , made a mess of it  and cried and throw a fit about how I was pushing her and extorting her for money and pushing her to be responsible for things she couldn't be and how I knew of her financial circumstances , how she's in debt , how she got four kids to raise ( actually five but one alr married out ) and how I was an utter ungrateful and uncaring person for forcing this upon her. How could I !!  Bla bla bla more crying and accusations  happpend , cry somemore  then ditched  the entire debacle to me to sort out after making a huge mess out of it . She was the one who came crying and asking to be responsible for everything and that we should leave it up to her??!!! I pushed her yes but only on weather she can shoulder the cost for the hospital fees for the birth which she insisted she just HAD to be responsible for . I knew that it was costly as hell to give birth and while i didn't know the details I knew she was having a hard time money wise , I kept telling her if she can't do it , to leave it to me and my mother but that we need to be notified on advanced so we can begin gathering the money required , THAT was what I was pushing. Not for her to be responsible for my shit or going after her money , I was looking out for her only to fucking get turned into the bad guy for it. 

She's done things like this so fucking often since then I've lost count and her brood isn't much better ( my husband age 21 , 2 younger sisters age 18/16  and the youngest lil guy aged 7 )  .  Her daughters have done  as things like dumping my things out on the floor and leaving it there like a rubbish pile for me to find and pick up because she wanted to use the drawer space  ( I only have TWO shelfs of drawer for my things in her entire house when I moved in to her place, not even an entire drawer  . Even my clothing was not given a place , I keep it together with my husband's closet. So I wasn't abusing their space or anything. ) 

There so many other ploys , plots , schemes and incidents that have happened but recounting all that isn't the point of this post. The point is her requesting money from us. I cannot legally work because of the meddling of my mother and because I'm my kid's primary care taker but I do come from a fairly decent background , we arn't rich but we do good for ourselves , they have been helping me fund me and myself since day 1 of this whole mess. My husband is young and was just in the army. He only started work about three months ago and works minimum wedge. He makes about $1500 only each month and I would only receive about 100-300 ( once 500 ) .  $600 of that goes to his mother monthly for ""rent "" , it's been like this ever since before he was in the army when he only earned $700 ,  and I would only have $100 from him each month after his mother canes in and takes her fill . In Singapore this can't even buy my baby's fill of milk for the month !  But she would , almost always come to us at each end of the month right before the day he get in paycheck to ""borrow"" and pull money despite knowing we NEED that money.  Her mindset is that she have no money on hand , we have money coming in tmr . Since needs money and we have some on hand  we should damn well give her it because we are ""family"" . Despite the fact that she herself have never even supported us  in anyway aside from the document signing she had to do that is legally required( even then I needed to push her alot to get things done ).  She have never spent a cent on me or my baby or sponsored us , helped us or lent us money at all. Hell back when we were making $700 per month she was taking $600 and leaving us with only $100 to survive in the most expensive country in the world - Singapore and not giving a fuck about how we were going to survive. That wasn't her problem according to her and since I always get by somehow and because I haven't  up and died I guess , it's totally ok for her to do this. Because she trust that I will find a way somehow no matter what  apperently🙄 . Only by my parent 's grace and help was I able to afford food , clothing and things needed to survive. She didn't contribute shit ! It's been two years and she's still on going with this . 



Yesterday night , the day before we get our monthly paycheck , she did it once again. She came to us asking for money ( I say come but it's message , she always message  and never do these requests face to face because she's sooooo busy  which is bull. She works 4 days a week and only at night for 6 hrs m I had longer hrs when I was a student and I was in the same exact field of work - sale lady , so I knew what I'm talking about. It's exhausting like any work would be yes BUT not as terrible or such a hardship as she's making it out to be. ) 

She knows we need that money and that we have barely any to spare ourselves and yet she still keeps asking and my husband , being the mama's boy he is doesn't think about how me and the baby would have to go back home to beg for money from people or borrow from others to survive when he just gives her the money.  He will give her and she would go away , until the NEXT month or most times not even a full month's time , when she needs money.  Her debt becomes my debt slowly. Just last month she borrowed $650 from my mom saying she will return at the end of the month but she never did . She took the $600 monthly ""rent "" and asked us for another $600 on top which my husband have your without saying anything to me. I was given about 300, $400 max for that month. Our baby still have monthly vaccine shots that cost around 280+/300+ . I would have +-100/50 to my name to survive. Like that's not even enough to buy a month supply of diaper or hell, a week's worth of food for BB and me !!!!! 



Like I have a kid to support wtf. I'm already having to make do with the little we earn in the first place but now she keeps taking and taking and taking, and her stupid son keeps giving and giving and giving not caring about his own kid and family.  It's always left to me to find someway to find money so I can support my kid because he won't bother or as he says "" you always find a way , I trust you will be able to get through it "". Fucking bull. It would be acceptable if it was once or twice or a few months , not TWO YEARS AND ON GOING. Not to mention anytime we don't give her the money she keeps saying she will go back to the Philippines and cancel her PR in Singapore. If she does that my husband as he's only turning 21 and still considered a minor here this a dependent , even tho she does shit all zero guardian duties , he will have to leave too and our whole family will be in even worse trouble. 

I'm ready to just blow up in all their faces , her , her son , her family.  I want to demand they sit down and talk with me and to ask WHAT THE FUCK is going on wtf are they thinking ? How they expect me to feed my child and survive if she keeps taking all our money and leaving me with $100-$400 per month and taking everything else? 

But as it's Asia and she's a really damn good story teller /sob story maker. She can cry and make a scene like no one's business and gather pity from even the COURTS.   That's how she got herself out of a court lawsuit when she didn't pay the feeds for her house in Philippines for over 5 years and they decided to reclaim it , she went there for three days , cried in the courts , spun and sob story and came out sparkling clean.  She is a TRICKY one. I'm living in her house some more and while I am paying rent and don't ow her shit , she never made a contract , she needed to at one point because we needed the paper work to file for a benifit while my husband was in soldier but she just said "" tmr "" , it never came and the time just went by. To this day no contract or evidence of rent agreement existing , just our verbal agreement.  And she's told everyone how she's amazing and how much she's done for us taking responsibility for things I've done and putting her  name on it , while hiding the things she's fucked us over with a deformed version of the events that favours her , making her into some holy mother , kind , pitiful , selfless figure   and villifying me.  





I want to go in hard and demand answers but I don't think that's the right step to do , espically since everyone around us are her people /family who all buys into her lies and is convinced the worst about me. That would only convince them even more that my MIL is an innocent and I'm the one in the wrong and that everything she's said about me is true/ all the events she claimed ( where she switch our roles and dramatise me to become a utter raging bitch )  is the truth.   But ai don't know  how to scheme or play the long game. I'm a very straight forward , nononsense person but that trait of mine is NOT helping me right now. I need to go up against someone this slippery and her bag  full of tricks.  Any advice and recommendations to how to do it or how to out plot her would  be very much appreciated.",JUSTNOMIL
"All these stories about MIL and names have me wanting to post my own. 


When I was a sweet summer babe with a noodley spine, I stupidly thought that entertaining the whims and tantrums of my MIL was a way to get her to like me and we could be a happy family.  


My daughter (our first), we named after my baby cousin who passed away from cancer when she was 10 years old.  It meant a lot to me since we were very close.  My DH liked the name in itself and was okay with it.  My MIL wasNOT happy with this so we gave my daughter my MIL name as a middle name AND let her choose the Chinese name. 


By the time we were pregnant with DS, we had had ENOUGH of her antics and just named him without even considering her.  My husband chose our son’s name since I had more pull for my daughter’s name and my grandma chose our son’s Chinese name.  


I’ll never forget when my MIL asked about DS name and I told her.  HUGE CBF and then she cried and tried for 20 minutes to get me to let her choose it.  Obviously she did this when she cornered me by herself.  When I told her I had enough and walked away she went to my BIL to cry about it and he came to me to get me to change it.  He tried, I asked him who named his son and who named him and his brothers.  He then never brought it up again. 


DS is now 10 months old and MIL has taken to calling him “QB” for “cute baby”.  This is because she HAS to assert her authority and name our child somehow.  His name, nickname (given by my DD) and his Chinese name is ignored.  She said it’s because she can’t pronounce his name, but my toddler with a speech delay and articulation issues can say it just fine.  


Anyways, every time she calls him QB or tries to get someone else to call him that, I correct them.  MIL says she cannot remember DS name.  So I told her that if that’s the case, she can never be trusted with the kids by herself.  If anything ever happened she wouldn’t even be able to give the police my kids names, how would she be able to make sure my kids are safe?",JUSTNOMIL
"TW: talk of suicide, suicide threats

&amp;#x200B;

I've posted a few times here and there, mostly about the incident with my MIL ""borrowing"" my car for a weekend and not giving it back at the agreed upon day, relying on my FH for rides to the store, etc. She's more of a BEC imo, but this time she's outdone herself and I'm not looking forward to the aftermath of this incident. 

&amp;#x200B;

So for a bit of filler for what has been going on, FH proposed to me recently on my birthday! We went to the zoo, he did it in front of my favorite exhibit, it was all very nice. His mom has always had a huge case of Jocasta but thankfully FH is aware of her shenanigans and has always been firmly on my side. She's never really been mean or rude to me directly but it definitely feels like she's in a (one-sided) competition with me for his attention. A few weeks ago they got into an argument after we announced our engagement and FH has been NC with her, as I have been for months. That means no more trips to the store, no more favors or taking her out to eat, nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, you may ask, ""after what happened last time why would you re-initiate contact with her?"" I hear you, and that's exactly what I said to FH when he decided to lift NC with her after the car incident. He felt bad for her, she kept coming into his work and begging to talk to him, I don't know why he gave in when that is clearly not acceptable behavior, but whatever. It's his mom.  But the proposal has awoken something new in her it seems. She begged FH to come to the zoo with us so she could ""watch"" (ew) and he shut that down. She admitted she would be jealous if he loved me more than her. She's also been calling him daily, all day, going in to harass him at work again, constantly texting him, and today she decided to escalate by threatening to commit suicide and it being ""his fault"". She even texted SIL about going through with it and it all being because of SIL's ""asshole brother"", which is FH of course. So we did what anyone would probably do and called a welfare check to her house. (I'm not sure if I mentioned this before, but MIL is a hoarder and an animal hoarder as well. To say her house reeks is an understatement. My apologies to the sheriff's deputies who had to deal with that.)

&amp;#x200B;

They took her (willingly I assume) to a local mental health clinic. Not sure if they are putting her in a psych hold yet, but we can only hope. The biggest kicker in the whole situation is that she tried to lie about going to this clinic. She tried to say she checked herself in because FH was upsetting her so badly (""I will tell you this that I am at \[name of clinic\] because you have me all upset! Yes you are part of the cause of why I am here today!"" direct transcription of her text to FH). Which obviously isn't true because I am the one who called the wellness check on her. There's only two people she threatened her life to (FH &amp; SIL) how can she not think it was one of us who called the sheriff and therefore we would know why she was in the clinic? Her reasoning baffles me sometimes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to read through this to make sure it all makes sense but let me know if there's anything I should elaborate on or if you have advice on how we should proceed with her! I've always felt a little guilty because she has absolutely nothing, but when she does stuff like this the fog lifts and I realize maybe she isn't as harmless as I assumed. Annoying, yes, but harmless?......I guess not.",JUSTNOMIL
"TRIGGER WARNING: SELF HARM, TRAUMATIZATION OF CHILDREN

So. Yikes.

I don't want to post exact details, but MIL and SIL were fighting. MIL aggressively self-harmed in front of SIL and SIL's kids. SIL called the police, MIL was taken to the hospital and patched up. No psych eval as far as DH and I know, but these actions are clearly a cry for help. No charges pressed.

She's been on this tailspin for a few weeks, but this was not how I expected things to come to a head. I don't have the emotional capacity for snark or sarcasm right now. DH is okay, mostly just exasperated. I'm having a hard time working it through in my head. We don't get along, but I didn't want her to jump off the deep end like this. SIL's kids are also having a hard time. They're so young and they don't understand. SIL can't afford counseling for them.

I'm not worried that MIL will pack up and head mine and DH's way (EDIT: DH and I live several states away from his FOO), but if SFIL and the police aren't going to push MIL into psychiatric care, I'm worried she'll keep escalating. I'm worried that she'll spiral out of control if this doesn't garner the response she wants/needs.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hey, y'all. It's been a minute since I've last posted. Sorry for dropping the ball on that, I know you guys are here to support me but my head tells me otherwise and I haven't been winning those interpersonal fights as of late. But I'm here, and am open to answer any questions you guys might have, or if this doesn't make sense, any info that might be needed. 

So I just recently went to a psychiatrist for the first time in my life. I have avoided going because I don't want to admit that I'm anything like my parents, both mom and dad. This is going to focus on my mom but my dad plays some sort of part in this as well. It's less about their actions, and more about their perspective.

Well, I went to the psychiatrist and we have determined through all my testings, testimonies, observations and the like, that I have a Schizo-effective Mood Disorder. So okay, that sucks. It already makes me too much like my parents. 🙄 but I promise this is relevant. 

Now, my mother's mom and my biological father had some mental health issues (both were bipolar paranoid schizophrenics. My dad is still alive but I don't have any contact with him, and haven't for years.) So with that being said, my mother has had a lot of experience around some of the symptoms that I am experiencing. And I've got to admit, wholeheartedly, that these ""episodes"" are absolutely shaking my reality. I don't know which way is up or down some days, and it's all come on very suddenly. 

My issue is while I want so badly to talk to my mother about her experiences with the mental disorders she's come into contact with, I also want to greyrock bc every other time I've ever told her anything about my life, she either blows it off or turns it on her. 
Like when i told her I was engaged, she said ""cool....did you know x-number of horses died in a fire last night?"" Well, no mom, I didn't, but thanks for showing me where the importance of my life is on your Richter scale. 

I want to open up about this with her bc even though I could tell you guys some horror stories (which I will work up to, but I've just recently started them for the first time verbally to my fiance, so I can't admit to some of them yet even in an anonymous point of view) she's still my mom. And that makes me internally angry. I don't want to care what she thinks, don't want to care about her opinion. But I also ant her perspective, I want her to CARE about me and what's going on in my life. But I don't even know if telling her this will change anything. It probably won't, honestly. But I'm really struggling with it, and I'm hoping you guys can either tell me I'm being dumb, or give me a swift kick in the ass. Whichever is needed.

Any and all advice is appreciated and welcomed. I hope you guys are having good days wherever you are. Thank you for listening to me.",JUSTNOMIL
"**UPDATE: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE ADVICE, EVERYONE! And sorry for my delay in response. All your comments really helped me realize that I need to set boundaries with her and not allow her to manipulate me. It's something I'm going to work on now and also encourage my fiance to do moving forward as we solidify our own family. She is mentally unwell and I think this manipulation has been a tool of hers for quite some time. HOWEVER, it will not work on me. Thanks for the encouragement, really :)**

My FMIL (fiance and I have been together 10 yrs) is overall a lovely person and she adores me, however, she has some trouble respecting my boundaries...no, I would not like a bible verse texted to me every morning...please don't touch my underwear after you encourage us to do laundry at your home (never doing that again even it is free vs $5 a load)...that kind of stuff. Hit a new hilarious but very uncomfortable for me low when we went over the other day for a bbq.

**FMIL to me within minutes of me walking in the door: ""I have a couple jobs for you could you blah blah blah blah and blah blah blah oh and I'm not liking the polish on my toes so will you TAKE IT OFF AND PAINT MY TOENAILS FOR ME?""**

I was dumbstruck. Kind of brushed it off and was like ""oh let me do that other job."" I swear she asked me when fiance wasn't there because she knew if fiance was it would have been shut down immediately. She kept it bringing it up though and eventually fiance said ""she's not doing that"" and she responded that she just wanted me to feel like part of the family (???). Didn't stop her from bringing her polish out and asking my opinion on colors, though.

I would love to just be blunt and give a direct no as soon as she asks something like this, but she is VERY sensitive and would probably cry and be extremely hurt. She would view it as a rejection. This is just one instance, but there are many more...I know there are worse problems to have but man, it drives me a little nuts, and I do think it's all a little manipulative (I'll save that for another post). I know I probably do need to be more direct with her, but she doesn't make it easy. I've enlisted my fiance to explain to her why I don't feel comfortable when she tries to include me in certain conversations or when she says or asks certain things, but she always pushes back and just says that I am part of the family and that is why she treats me this way. I know she wants us to be closer, but the irony is that we can't be because I can never relax around her because she won't respect my boundaries that I have made pretty clear in the kindest way possible.

Wow, this turned into a novel! Before the other day I'd probably say the worst thing I'd seen her do was ask my fiance who is 31 yrs old to sit on her lap, pedicure request takes the cake now...",JUSTNOMIL
"My MIL turned from ”wow what a fun MIL!” to showing her true “Just No” colors since I first met her. At this point she’s dangerously close to becoming a BEC for me....
      
She has made comments to me and DH before about giving her grandkids (he is the first of her children to marry.) They’ve never bothered me too much, but her latest comment got under my skin. 
      
My BIL (DH’s brother) is now engaged, so there will be a second married couple amongst her children. This weekend we were celebrating the engaged couple when (after half a bottle of wine), MIL turned to me and said “I think [new DIL] will have a kid before you.” It’s worth noting that her tone was confrontational and almost kind of sing-songey. I just looked at her, nodded, smiled, and blinked. I think I managed to say “Ooook.” I mean, what do I say to that? I thought that another woman’s fertility/family planning is something you should never talk about? While DH and I aren’t trying  to get pregnant at the moment, she doesn’t necessarily know that. What if we HAD been trying and that comment would have been really hurtful? Also, she herself struggled with infertility, so you’d think she would know this. 
      
It should also be noted that DH and I have only been married one year. And obviously my BIL and his fiancé aren’t even married yet. So isn’t she kind of jumping the gun? Am I overreacting? Has she become a BEC for me? Or is this truly rude? I know that the concept of MIL’s pressuring DILs for grandchildren is not new and fairly common but still... ughhhhh",JUSTNOMIL
"I put no advice wanted, but it’s always welcome!

Little information from my past posts: DH and I used to live in the same house as MiL. We moved out, which caused a whole shitstorm with MiL, and now she is on her own completely (yay!!!). 

Onto the story! 

MiL sends a text to DH Monday afternoon, asking if he was at work. He wasn’t, we were enjoying the holiday weekend together having a date night. DH replies stating that we were out, but wanted to know what she needed. MiL asks if we could take her to a dealership to look at a 1995 car, since hers is broken down. Mind you, MiL destroyed her credit when she stopped paying on all of her credit cards, and didn’t even pay off her last car (We did, as DH was using it for work and MiL had no money). 

DH let her know we were out enjoying some time together, as he hardly has days off right now due to forced overtime at work. She threw a fit! MiL started to call every few minutes, trying to get into contact with DH, who ignored all of the calls. She sent him multiple texts in a row, saying she just needed a ride too and from (if she didn’t get the car) and it was “the least he could do” for moving out. DH mentioned calling an Uber or Lyft, to which she replied saying she couldn’t afford to get one. Yet, you can afford to get another car?

Turns out, MiL was recently fired from her job, and had an interview early Wednesday morning. Her plan was to try and finance a $1500 car, while not having credit and no way to prove she is making money, since she now isn’t. Plus, most dealerships down where I live will not finance that cheap of a car anyway, you have to pay cash. 

After many more texts and trying to argue with DH, she changes her tone and asks for a ride to the interview. She states that she will worry about how to get to and from each day if she gets the job, but is pretty confident she will get the job since they haven’t looked at other candidates. Again, DH recommends getting a taxi, because he works third shift and wouldn’t be able to take her on time. 

This lady has the audacity to say that I could take her, without even asking me! Let alone, this is the same lady who said she was done with me, wanted nothing to do with me and blamed me for DH and I buying our own home and starting our life away from her. She and I are on NC and have been since about March. Not sure why she thought things would have changed now, just to help her out. 
MiL finally said she would figure something else out, but not without blaming DH for not having a ride. 

DH went over late Monday night while MiL was asleep to look at the car, as he is super handy with them and knows how to fix almost anything on MiLs car (it used to be his back in high school). From what he was told, the car wouldn’t start up at all. When he got there, DH started up the car with no problem and took it for about a half hour drive, me following behind incase it did break down. Nothing! Driving it back to her house, it ran smoothly and had no problems. Just to be on the safe side, DH checked under the hood to ensure that all the previous work that was done to it was still holding up. It was. 

The following morning, DH sends a text to MiL letting her know that the car was fine and could make it to either the dealership or her interview without a problem, and if she chose to take the car and it did break down, to call and he would go pick her up. Nice that he went to help out, right? WRONG! 

MiL threw one of her famous crying fits, saying she never asked him to come and look at the car (she has before though) and how he should have done it when she was awake instead of at night. Ding ding ding, there’s the real reason why she wanted a ride: just so she could see DH. Trying to pull one of her typical manipulation tactics, she went on to say how he should buy her a new car because it’s his fault it broke down because he was using it to drive to and from work (10 minute drive). This was months ago that this ended, when I moved back into my mothers and DH had our car every night. Obviously that’s not going to happen anyway, but we couldn’t afford another car even if we wanted too, as we have a little one on the way and just bought our new home. 

DH shut her down quick, letting her know that the car was fine and he did not appreciate her trying to dump another one of her problems on him, as she is famous for doing. She tried to call him again and again, being ignored every time. He finally let her know he would not be taking her calls and not responding to her texts until she calmed down and could act/think rationally. What a joke, LOL. 

Anyway, she finally stopped texting and calling, and haven’t heard anything since. Thank goodness!

Some may think that it was shitty of us not to just give her a ride, but after everything that she has done and drama caused over the past few months, she is on her own completely. MiL knows this, as it was told to her when we moved out. Sorry not sorry, but I’m not helping those who have said they are done with me!

Edit: Wow, this really blew up! Thank you to everyone who has replied, and hopefully I was able to get back to everyone (apologies if not)! 

MiL tried to call again today for unknown reasons. DH and I just sat there and watched the phone ring, and went back to our dinner right after. As far as I know, DH plans to take a break from answering her calls it’s texts, as he just doesn’t want to deal with her and her attitude. Thanks again everyone!!",JUSTNOMIL
"I can't even fucking process what the fuck just happened...I'm shaking while typing this, so apologies ahead of time if this isn't as cohesive as I hope to make it...

I'll start with a little more context since the title almost speaks for itself. 

This morning I woke up to another shitty text from my FMIL (*see post history for details*) and for once I actually had the audacity to stand up for myself! 

Someone else described FMILs behavior perfectly on my last post, and called it ""toxic positivity"". I don't think she's necessarily malicious, because she isn't coherent enough to be (history of drug abuse + mental health problems). But she's SO immature, self centered, and petty, that she is basically just naturally a manipulative mean girl. 

This makes it really hard to call her on her shit, because she's conveniently always the victim who was ""just kidding"". Unless she spontaneously decides to be a puddle, as she does. 

 Anytime someone tells her she did something that was HURTFUL, everything becomes solely about how hurt SHE is that the other person would so cruelly tell her SHE hurt THEIR feelings... 

Everything is about her and everything is always someone else's fault.

So after I told FMIL that what she said to me this morning was hurtful and offensive (in a very straightforward way), and then proceeded to ignore her calls... FDH gets off work and tells me he got a text from FFIL. 

A little more context: FFIL is abusive and controlling. Him and I have a very traumatic history, and do not get along. I tolerate him, but avoid him as much as possible. He tries to say he wants a relationship with me, and that I don't need to be uncomfortable around him... But he gives me the total heebie jeebies at best, and absolutely enrages me at the worst. 

He is EXACTLY like my JNM, but in some ways worse, especially because of his influence on FMIL. Much like my mother, he is a ""Dumb Narcissist""...just more dumb, and with more bark. 

He neglected and verbally/emotionally abused FDH, basically all the way up until I came around. He still does the same to FMIL. 

He's essentially the worst kind of bully if I put it nicely.

So the conversation reads exactly as follows:

FFIL: *Last Friday you informed me that your mother is suicidal and you wonder why. Well read the text she got today, then you will have some idea why. Don't call her I finally got her to sleep.*

FDH: *Every time mom says something hurtful and we tell her that it HURT OUR FEELINGS she crawls into a corner and plays the victim. we are able to stand up for OUR FEELINGS when they are hurt. When (OP) says she is depressed and mom makes an insensitive 'joke', she's allowed to tell mom why what she said hurt her feelings. (OP) had to uninvite her mom from the wedding, and instead of mom being supportive she totally trivialized the way (OP) felt. I read the text, I okayed the text to be sent. how dare you blame my fiance's text message for my mother being suicidal.

A TEXT MESSAGE IS NOT TO BLAME FOR MY MOTHER'S MENTAL HEALTH. MY FIANCE IS NOT TO BLAME FOR MY MOTHER'S MENTAL HEALTH.*

FFIL: *did you just say fuck off to me!*

FDH: *Read the text again.*

FFIL (and this one literally just came as I'm already typing): 

*you talk about  you and your  fiancee, 
you have 3+years with your mate.
I have 27 years with mine and  feel the same. I'm the one that guards the gate, now you are in my place I hope you understand that people have feelings other than yours , that is called respect,  I read the text and didn't see anything that Your mother said that could in any way put anyone down or that can be construed   to be negative.*

FDH is now fuming and has yet to respond... I honestly feel like puking right now I'm so upset.

I'm shaking too badly to keep updating so I'm going to have to try and go get a hold of myself somehow and comeback later.

Thank you for reading and being so supportive everyone, I really need it right now",JUSTNOMIL
"I posted half of this story in another subreddit about my husband and this other half is about the parents in law.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents in law comes over one weekend a month since i got married and i had enough. I have only been married a year and few month

My parents in law go so used to visit us they don't even ask if they can they just call and be like hey we coming. 

I dont know what to do, how can i stop them. They don't even bring any positive energy with them. Everytime they come they expect to eat and to buy some BS and ofcourse scan me and comment about my hair, my skin my makeup, what i eat etc. I am 62kg and they think im fat.

They even come on saturday at 8am when i finally could catch up some sleep since i work until 2 am in the week, i have full time job and a side hustle. 

I don't want to see them once a month, they literally screw that full month for me. My father in law has a shitty attitude, other than controlling he left two times on sunday without saying goodbye to me and expected me to follow him and say goodbye myself since he's old and somehow deserves this. My mother in law does not shut up. She could literally talk non stop for 4 hours straight and that really stresses me she ll be talking to me.

Last visit i decided to stay in my room so they get the message that i do not want them in my house anymore and it became a big fight with my DH since his parents told him behind my back that i was staying in my room and refusing to come out.

Between i live in a small house so they are litterally in my face during these 48hours. I tried to go out when they over so i dont have to deal with them, ofcourse they get mad when i do but they will actually wait for me until i comeback to do anything including eating. And my father in law choses the menu... he is an abusive husband and dad so even old he still have that control, even though he know i dont eat fish or or he still choses it.

I want to just tell them in their faces to fuck off but i know once i do it will be the end of us. 

How can i indirectly tell them to fuck off?",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi y'all! My SO's mom is really ratcheting up her behavior with this impending move. I accepted a dream job in a dream city and my SO and I are planning to move next month. We couldn't be more excited.

My SO recently gave notice for his job and has been shopping for phone plans. In the middle of this, his mom wanted to get lunch with him. At lunch, my SO was discussing phone plans when his mom suggested that he ""just join [her] plan! It'll only be $40 [this is false, btw]!"" SO actually did briefly consider this when he and I were talking about it earlier in the week -- my advice was, ""absolutely fucking not"". SO stated his position that he'd rather get his own phone plan. His mom seemed upset, but eventually backed down when she realized she wouldn't win. 

Then, the topic of the new job and relocation came up. SO's mom accused me of ""not trying hard enough"" to find a job in our current city. SO reminded her that I've spent the last year working a job that put the ""hell"" in healthcare, and that I've been unable to find a job in my somewhat niche area of experience in our city. So, we're relocating because I've gotten a really sweet opportunity that'll put me where I want to be professionally. This, however, didn't appear to register with his mom, who said, ""It's like you're TRYYYYING to leave me behind!! Don't MYYY feelings matter??"" Never mind that my SO was sitting at lunch with her and making plans to see a movie with her, but whatever. 

SO and I debriefed this over dinner that evening. There was some rug-sweeping -- ""She's lonely"" ""She's jealous"" ""She pays for her behavior by not getting to have relationships with other people"". I called SO on it and reminded him that I won't prioritize our happiness and our stability over her inability to recognize that her behavior is a problem.  

A couple weeks later, I'm still a bit pissed about it. I told SO that until she can calm down and get a grip, I'm not going to engage with her beyond basic cordiality. SO said, ""She's just emotionally dumb and this sort of thing isn't an area of strength for her."" I said, ""I understand, but until she can act like a grownup about you having a life, I do not want to be around her."" SO was surprisingly understanding of this, as I emphasized how hurt I've been by her behavior as of late and how angry it makes me that she just... gets away with this sort of thing.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hey guys, another week, another round of the dumbs. 

Thought you guys might be amused by this one:

Pig Farmer has a semi-extensive and constanly growing honey-do list for DH. She should know better at this point, because DH never does honey-do's. He's seriously terrible about it. Like, you can ask him to fix something for a fucking year and the only way it's getting done is if you do it yourself. This is especially true of petty shit that causes very minor inconveniences. It's annoying af and we have fought over it in the past. 

At any rate, DH and I got into it over some of the honey-do chores here at our own house last week. As I have mentioned previously, we are trying to sell. Some of this shit needs to get fixed and he's far better at carpentry than I am. He needed to do it. No ifs, ands or buts. 

Pig Farmer caught the tail end of one of these discussions (he called me from home depot during ball) and decided to once again try to throw her own long ass list of small repairs and annoyances in on top of mine. 

Now, Pig Farmer is low-key destructive. I don't think she really tries to break things, but she never addresses minor problems until they turn into major ones, so shit tends to snowball. DH has told her multiple times that this shit isn't his problem and she needs to call her landlord, but she won't. The list of repairs needed at this point is looooooooonnnnggg. 

She brings up her honey-do's to DH. He's surly and non-committal. She brings them back up to me when he's not there. She complains he was surly and non-committal. I point out he doesn't even fix crap around our house without a fight and I'm his freaking wife. 

Her response ""But, I'm his MOM.""

My actual reply: I'm having sex with him. His kid came out my vagina. If he won't fix things for me, he's not going to do it for anyone.

She was not amused, but she shut up. 

In other news, she is currently playing invalid because she spilled hot coffee on herself. She claims its a serious burn that's costing hundreds/thousands to treat, but she's massively overdramatic about health issues so we are giving her 0 attention over this and she's angry about it.

However, its become more important than ever for us to make it clear we WILL NOT be taking care of her because.....sigh.... the out of state move is canceled for the time being.

I am seriously fucking disappointed, y'all. Seriously fucking disappointed. I was really looking forward to getting her the hell out of my daily life. DH and I were on the same page. We were ready. We were taking steps to prepare to go. It looked so promising... and then DH's job decided to cough up a raise that was double what he had hoped/asked for. Its enough money that it is unlikely he will be able to replace it or get hired on for the same anywhere else. We already knew there was a chance the move might require him to take a small demotion in terms of job title, but we were pretty sure he could still pull roughly the same money. This raise changes that, and after a looooooooooonnng talk, we've come to the conclusion that moving isn't the right choice for him career-wise at this moment. 

I suppose the good news is that we now probably an can afford a decent property around here. 

I am so bummed. I'm going to be dealing with this woman forever, and no, NC doesn't really work because she just turns into a stalker that knows better than to make threats. Ugh, I am not up for another 20 years of being followed around the goddamned Kroger and bitched at bc her son's an asshole.",JUSTNOMIL
"So this happened about a month ago but it still bothers me. Sorry if it's a long post.

DH and I just bought our first house together so between us both working full time and fixing up our new house we've been very busy. 

I've been doing a lot of meal prepping on weekends so I wouldn't have to make dinners during the week after I get home from work, and so we'd have more time to work on the house. 

Well on Saturday I decided to cook a ham dinner with all the fixings so we'd have a few days worth of leftovers.  

I swear MIL and GMIL can sense when I'm cooking a meal.  Both of them live together and hate to cook and live off frozen food. They love to take advantage of my meals because I make everything from scratch. 

They called up DH to see what we were doing and he mentioned I was cooking. Well as soon as they found out I was cooking I could hear them squeal with excitement. He told them there wasn't enough food made for everyone and they said ""Oh that's okay we'll bring something!! And we don't eat that much!""

Well they showed up, and what did they bring with them?  NOTHING.  

I even made the comment that we weren't expecting anyone over. 

I watched in disgust as they piled their plates with all the food I spent hours cooking that was supposed to feed DH and I throughout the week.  By the end of their gluttonous feast there wasn't anything left. 

My favorite part was they had the audacity to ask what was for dessert....",JUSTNOMIL
"This really sucks. I feel super raw right now. My sister sent me a screenshot of a text Eggshelly sent her and her roommate. The backstory is that my sister rents a house that eggs, our mother, owns. No lease. Just good ol' family trust. UGH. 

Text reads thusly: 
Eggs: I have a thirty day eviction notice sitting in front of me. I drove by the house. It is obvious that neither of you know how to do yard work. I am Done. You don't deserve to live there any longer. I will not have this conversation again. Should I send them... I think I will unless you convince me otherwise. Furthermore, if I don't hear from you today, I will hand deliver your eviction notices to you. Texting doesn't count.

LIKE WHAT THE FUCK?!?! She has threatened my sister with eviction before when she is mad. It's very fucked up. I've told her she can stay with us if she needs to for a little while. We've been texting each other and processing. She's still at work so can't really deal with this, so I called my dad for her.

MEGA rug sweeping from him. He laughed and said it's not a big deal and mom isn't going to evict them. I told him that it is really fucked up for her to threaten that. He basically said that eggs has been doing really well lately, and he doesn't want this to mess that up. That rock the boat quote is really feeling so relevant right now. UGH UGH UGH I'm so mad that he doesn't seem to see how bad it is through the super thick fog. He said he's going to talk to her, and calm her down. He said that all it will probably take is an apology from my sister and an assurance that she'll fix the yard issues. I asked him, ""Is Eggs going to apologize too?""

It is 100% not ok for Eggs to just hold my sister's home stability over her head every time she's mad. Once she threatened to evict her because she brought a check over after work the day it was due. She claimed that because she couldn't take it to the bank that day it was late. 

Sorry this story is all over the place and incomplete, I'm just so pissed off. My husband isn't here to vent to. 

Here's the thing I don't know what to do about. I love Eggshelly. When she isn't mad, she's an awesome mom, and I really enjoy hanging out with her. She just really flies off the handle when something doesn't go her way. It's like she immediately sees it as the ultimate betrayal and must then fight to keep us in line. People have suggested to me before that she might have Borderline Personality Disorder. Maybe this is more a question for my therapist, but how do I try to get her to seek help specifically for that? or re-diagnosis. It's kinda not my business what she does in therapy, but I know that people with Borderline Personality Disorder can get help and seek treatment. 

My dad says she is currently in therapy. I hope that wasn't a lie. I really would love it if she ends up apologizing for once and letting us know that she is working on her rage issues. 

If my sister is forced to move out over this, I will not be speaking to Eggs again. I'd much rather she get treatment, and then I can forgive mistakes. But damn this is so fucked up. 

This just in: Sister has decided for dad's sake, she will bite the bullet just this one more time and not cause any extra drama to derail the progress eggs has made. I just told sister that I understand, but please know that she did not cause drama. Eggs did. I fully have my sisters back no matter what she decides. 

I just sent my sister the ""Don't rock the boat"" post. I meant to send it to her a long time ago, just kept forgetting. It's super relevant currently. 

I feel like every time something like this happens and we push it down, and rugsweep, I just get further alienated from my mom because there is no closure, no remorse from her. I miss thinking my mom was awesome.

Edit: Thank you so much for all the great support and advice. I really feel like this community has given me a lot of tools for standing up for myself and not just shutting down. I really can see in action an improvement even with just how I handled the phone conversation with my dad. I listened to his points and recognized them, but did not back down on the fact that this is not ok, and yes it is a big deal. Thank you so much for that. 

The rugsweeping unfortunately is already in place. I can't decide for my sister how she handles these things, and trying to force her to do what I think is best is pretty much just treating her how mom does. I am going to have some sister real talk with her though and strategize a potential lease agreement, and give her some of the resources that this community has given to me. Might even encourage her to get on here. 

Today, my goal is to take care of myself and not let my anger and frustration over this situation take me over. I will make a therapy appointment, and continue checking things off my very full to do list. I will not let her actions derail my progress. My mental health is #1.",JUSTNOMIL
"Okay so I already have two cats and a couple weeks ago, we saved a kitten from drowning in our pool. The vet is full and the only other places accepting animals are kill shelters and by this time, I’m way to attached to the kitten to let him go.

I was very hesitant at first, but I now love this kitty and am almost ready to start the introduction process (he just needs to get vaccinated and get neutered first). 

I guess my mom was talking to my brother about the kitten and she offered it to him. My brother texts me asking me if I’m keeping the cat and I say something along the lines of “yes, if CJ and him do get along within a month I’m going to”

My brother, who has one cat, but has moved out, does not know the first thing about introducing cats. It’s not a simple process. It took me two agonizing weeks to get CJ and Johnny to get along and I’m scared to do it again, but as I said, I love the kitten and am willing to once he’s old big enough. If his cat isn’t as social as he thinks she is, then things could go bad fast and this kitten will very much defend himself. 

I just feel so upset by this. I’ve carried this kitten everywhere I’ve gone for the past two weeks and slept on the floor for a week to make sure he was okay and my mom betrays me by getting my brother all excited about him. After three days, I told her how attached I was to him and that if I had to give him up, I’d be devastated, but again, would do so if CJ did not get along with him after a month because that would be the best option for all of the cats involved.

My mom just spends so much time trying to please my brother, I just don’t see why she can’t give me half the respect she has for him. He gets all the benefits of being an adult with none of the responsibilities and I get all of the responsibilities of being an adult, with none of the benefits.

And I get from her perspective, three cats is a lot, but at one point, my family had four dogs. My cats are very well taken care of and I love them to death. My brother literally didn’t know what catnip was and instead of googling it, just dumped some on his cat tree for his cat who was under a year old at the time. He’s not abusive towards her, he just doesn’t know what he’s doing and my mom is enabling this behavior by doing things like offering up my fucking cat to him. And no, I won’t be giving up my cat to him. If I did, then I’d probably end up with him dead because my brother wouldn’t know when to separate them during the introduction part. I’m not the best at standing up to my mom, but when things involve my cats, I have a very shiny spine.

There’s so much to unpack here. I’m sorry, I’m just tired and upset and there’s so much to this situation. Feel free to ask for clarification on anything",JUSTNOMIL
"So, I have posted here about my own in-laws multiple times. Today I really need to vent about my grandmother, who was my mom's JNMIL. This is going to be really long but I honestly need to get this out. I put NAW because this isn't a super complex situation, but any outside feedback is appreciated. 

To give some context: My dad was an only child, but he was still GC status. My Grandma has always told me that she wanted 6+ kids but after dad was born, grandpa refused to have any more. Literally the entirety of my life though, there was always a sense from my grandma that my dad could do no wrong.

My grandpa was bipolar and, well... let's just a say a *southern preacher*. My grandma was a ""preacher's wife"" to the public and a pill popper to the inner circle. I never saw this until I was much older, obviously, but my mom says it played a lot into how my dad turned out. The summary is that basically my grandpa did whatever he wanted and to deal with it my grandma would drug herself up - leaving my teenage dad to go whatever he pleased as well. 

*Side note: my dad was a drug addict/alcoholic and died in a car accident in 2009. My grandpa died of medical complications a few years later. My grandma lives alone in their home. It's miserable.*

I became the GGC even before birth. I never got the full story, but my grandma was at the hospital while mom was in labor with me. She took it on herself to tell doctors things against my mom's wishes while she was sleeping. When mom had to go back to work, grandma became my babysitter. It was apparently a constant battle of my grandma doing things however she pleased. The stand-out example was when grandma decided to drive me around in the front seat with my car seat facing forward *at a few months old* no matter how many times my mom told her to stop. Apparently I ""liked to look at all the colors"". I think by my 1st birthday I had a different babysitter.

I have two younger siblings. When my mom announced her pregnancy with the 2nd kiddo, grandma literally told her ""it doesn't matter how many kids you have. I will never love them as much as I love OP.""

My grandma used me as an emotional support animal my entire life. She would pump all of us for information about my parents lives in private. I believe at one point she even went through their paperwork at our home because she felt entitled to know their finances. She enabled my dad *constantly*. When he would blow our money and my mom cut him off in order to pay our bills, grandma would make sure he had cigarettes and spending money. My mom left with us after she was finally fed up. Despite the fact that dad went harder into drugs and spent more time with his gf than us kids - grandma still managed to spin it to be my mom's fault in her head. It was honestly a shit show. It still is.

Anyway, I am now a mom myself. I live over 4 hours away from grandma and rarely visit home so I don't interact with her very often. However she still treats my DD(3) like she's the second coming of Christ. In April, we went to a graduation party for my sister and of course grandma was there. We had never been close enough for her to boundary stomp with me so I wasn't as on guard as I should have been. Apparently she felt she had some time to make up for. 

DD has a sweet tooth on top of being a picky eater. So we have a rule that she strictly understands - we must eat healthy food to deserve treats. Simple, right? Now for the party my mom had set out a food table and a dessert table. We all sat down to talk/eat and DD refuses any of the food. I explain to DD -IN FRONT OF MY GRANDMA- that if she doesn't eat something healthy then she isn't getting any candy/cake. My mom sitting across the table does me the favor of backing me up. DD just says ""okay"" and moves on. After awhile my grandma tells me that she's taking DD outside for a minute. I occasionally walk her around if she's bored with her environment so I didn't even process how weird it was. After they came back, my mom points out that grandma went out for a smoke....something I 100% do not let my DD around. We don't even visit grandma's house because she's a chain smoker and we refuse to risk anything. I don't know how to actually say this to her though because she genuinely believes second hand smoke doesn't exist. 

Now, when they came back in they went to the other side of the room. They had previously been playing ball in that area so again, I didn't process. It was again pointed out to me by my mom that they were actually sitting in the corner chairs EATING CANDY. Now my daughter didn't say a single word to me about it so I'm positive my grandma distinctly told her not to tell me. She's 3 so, unless told otherwise, she would have been excited to tell me all about it. At a later point I decided to bend the rules and share some cake with DD. My grandma had the audacity to say to DD, ""ooohhhh, you got some cake despite what mimi (my mom) says!"" As if my mom made the rules???? When I learned all of the background bullshit from my mom later on I was beyond pissed. I struggled with what to do about it because my mom said if I said anything at all, grandma would deny it. This was the first instance of her boundary stomping with my kid and my mom honestly laughed at me like she was a war veteran and I was the rookie.

A week later was my sister's actual graduation. Now, she's a college graduate and has been accepted to grad school to enter a *wonderful* career in a few years. So this is an extra big deal. Our grandparents weren't invited because of limited seating. On the way home, my grandma called ME around midnight (sounding high) to ask where the pictures were on Facebook. I explained that my sister had already posted her graduation photos a few days ago. She clarifies that she saw those, *she means the photos of me/DH/DD at the graduation*. 

This bitch seriously called me on the night of my sister's graduation to ask where the pictures of me where. I later learned that she never called my sister to congratulate her.

Now, at this point I'm fuming. I'm very protective of my siblings and it didn't help her case that I was already pissed at her. A few days later we had our gender ultrasound. I didn't feel like calling her so she got a FB message that it's another girl. Her only response was, ""We will take it. Lord let it be healthly."" Then she sent me a meme video about friendship and told me that she loved me??? Can you tell she doesn't care much about kids past the first born??

Basically, that was the beginning of May and I haven't contacted her since. I didn't call her for mother's day. I'm worried that if I talk to her then I'll unload about something. I lost my entire paternal side within a few years aside from this woman. She's also in poor health for her age so I doubt she'll be around much longer. Going completely NC is something I just don't want to do.... but good God if i'm not going to take very long breaks from her bullshit.

So, that is my rantings about the latest bullshit from my JNGM. I don't think it ever crossed my mind that she would boundary stomp with my kids the way she did with me, and damnit if she didn't prove me wrong.",JUSTNOMIL
"Her nickname: Heimdall (The gatekeeper for Asgard)... this is my FMIL (his stepmom)

&amp;#x200B;

Hey everyone, long time lurker but first time poster. I'm honestly just at a loss of how to deal with this situation anymore. We've been together almost 5 years, he is the oldest of 4 (2 siblings with his Nmom (FSIL1 and FSIL2), and 1 with his stepmom (FSIL3))... not sure if anything else is pertinent at the moment lol.

&amp;#x200B;

PREPARE YOURSELVES for a lot of bitterness, boundary stomping, and just general complaining. I don't really have anyone I can talk to about this stuff besides my therapist and my sessions with her could be used to cover other ground that is more relevant to my day to day life.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically I'm just emotionally drained by interactions with his stepmom. Heimdall is into MLMs, her identity is a mother and that's about it, she doesn't carry on a conversation for long unless she's the only one talking, she is extremely controlling of family situations, how she treats my boyfriend and his sisters vs her biological daughter is appalling to me, and she steamrolls over boundaries I set. I guess it's worth mentioning that while my family isn't perfect, the one thing they EXCEL at is making time for each other and prioritizing that. His family doesn't do this and it is heartbreaking for both of us. I have tried so hard for so long to have a good relationship with her, but all it does is bring me pain and bitterness.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some examples of things she's done within the past year (there are many, many more) that I've brought up in therapy and with my boyfriend that I still don't know how to come to terms with or adapt so that my future interactions with her can have the potential to be pleasant.

&amp;#x200B;

**Christmas 2018**... Our first Christmas together (after 4 years of spending them with our families separately)... I was only invited to their trailer because SO and FFIL made it clear that if I wasn't coming, neither was SO. FFIL put his foot down and said I was coming and that's that. So this event (on top of other family events) made it painfully and obviously clear that to her, I am not a part of their family unit. Why do I care? Because she is a central part of the family. Her opinion in and of itself is not relevant to me, but the power behind that opinion dictates my plans. Heimdall had texted me for gift ideas, I gave her some and none of what I suggested was a gift I received (SO says that's selfish and petty, but if someone asks me for a gift idea and gets me something completely irrelevant, I personally find that hella rude). An example of a gift she got me that I do like, but have conflicted feelings on now: a lithograph from my favorite Disney movie. Why I'm conflicted: she disclosed that it was in their shed forever (like from before FSIL3 was born) and basically bragged about having a gift for me that she didn't have to buy. I'm all for being frugal, but it's not the best idea to share that with the recipient, especially when I'm the only one who has gotten her a gift out of the children and it was such a well thought out, elaborate gift. I'm still really raw with pain over her reaction to the gift even though I wasn't there for it (that was Christmas 2017).

&amp;#x200B;

**March 2019 visit to our house**... in the 4.5 years we've been together, his family has come to visit our town (only 3 hours away from where they live) 3 times. Once was for his BS graduation (Heimdall did not attend), once passing through on the way to see FGMIL, and once to see us (but also on the way back from seeing FGMIL -- this is a pattern, you'll see).

First off, they were at least 3 hours late coming to see us because FSIL3 and FGMIL were getting along for once (and the sickness which is mentioned later). Why a grown woman argues with a child, I'll never know, but it is a rarity for them to have fun together and Heimdall wanted to soak it all in. SO, FFIL, and I were all upset about this because it is disrespectful of our time and messed with our plans to an extent.

We were supposed to go do some activities with FSIL3 (she's 9) and unfortunately that plan didn't pan out because she was sick. As a future medical professional, I was curious what medication the doctor prescribed for her and Heimdall told me she visited a chiropractor and got an adjustment and it cured her... \*rolls eyes\*. Anyways, that became a thing and I really have a disdain for people who don't take me seriously, so it left a bad taste in my mouth. Whatever, we moved past that... but then, at lunch, we went out for BBQ and FSIL3 was still hungry, but Heimdall said ""we don't eat bread"" even though it came with our meals. So I offered her some of my food, since I still had some left. FSIL3 is already experiencing issues with food, as have FSIL1&amp;2 (I'm not blaming HD, but there's definitely a correlation between her food control and these issues).

THEN at dinner time, she claimed FSIL3 was getting hungry. FSIL3 said she was fine, so I gave Heimdall two options: I can go pick some food up for us OR we can order in; I did not have enough food in the fridge for all 5 of us to eat a proper meal (well we did have one but she vetoed it because she didn't like that option). Heimdall circumvents me, goes to SO, and asks if she is allowed to cook in our kitchen; SO not knowing this was an issue and a violation of boundaries I had just laid down with her, said sure. So next thing I see is Heimdall in my kitchen, cooking dinner. Her idea for dinner? Eggs. Friggin eggs. So then I have to pull SO aside and tell him what happened and why it upset me and I can't help but feel that what she did was intentional because I told her no, so she went to who would say yes. Like a petulant child, if you ask me.

I brought it up with SO again after they left, who then brought it up to FFIL. Whether FFIL and Heimdall discussed it, I'm not sure but it was made clear to FFIL that his wife made me feel uncomfortable in my own home.

&amp;#x200B;

*\*In between these visits, the texting about events switched from a convo between me andHeimdallJ (since we know our household schedules the best) to SO and Heimdall. I'm chalking this up to me shooting down some of Heimdall's suggestions because they didn't work for us, and that she wanted a different answer. Total speculation on that though\**

&amp;#x200B;

**May 2019 visit**... so this visit actually didn't happen at all. We were planning on joining them at a theme park for the day, but SO couldn't get off work, so we all agreed we would do dinner or something the following day together. Everyone was pleased with that compromise. The trip approaches, and I ask SO what the definitive plans are and he didn't know so he called FFIL. FFIL was expressing frustration about Heimdall and FGMIL and how often they saw FGMIL and how little they see FSIL1/2/3, SO, and FGMIL/FGFIL on FFIL's side. SO and I also lamented because it's something we both struggle with as well. The 3 of us were throwing around ideas, like the zoo near our house or the zoo near FGMIL (SO shot that down because he said he wants to see the effort made to see him and not something out of convenience -- straight up told FFIL that) he's got a nice shiny spine sometimes and I love it. We end the call with the thought of a group chat between the 4 of us about plans. 2 days go by, the day before they arrive for their vacation. I ask what the plan is (I loathe spontaneous trips and need to mentally prepare to see Heimdall)... and they didn't have an answer for us. SO and I confirmed plans we had for Friday night with a group of friends (plans made months ago that we were willing to ditch for SO's family -- I feel guilty about that part) and then of course, what does SO's family say hours later? They can't meet up with us Saturday because staying with FGMIL for the night wasn't going to work out (it would've been out of their way to do so, but FFIL's approach to Heimdall and FGMIL is ""you don't tell a woman when she can see her mother"" although that's exactly what she does with him and his family...). SO makes it clear that we have plans Friday night at 7PM, so we can meet up before then or Saturday. For unknown reasons, the plans fell through. SO and I were both devastated. His family was going to be 10 minutes from our house and couldn't be bothered to make it work to see us (this is a common theme with SO's family in general (goes beyond the parties mentioned here) and in my extended family).

Saturday, SO and I go to the mall to look at engagement rings (YAY!). SO gets a call from FFIL, who was really emotional about not getting to spend enough time with his adult kids and was feeling nostalgic because he came across some of SO's childhood toys. I'm not going to lie, I had 0 empathy towards FFIL in that moment, I was so hurt that I couldn't comprehend (still don't tbh) how he can call SO and talk about missing him when he passed up on the chance to see us the previous day. SO and I got into a bit of an argument about my lack of empathy and what he basically calls my justice boner when it comes to me being hurt and then the person who hurts me being hurt too. He's done a whole lot more personal growth than I have and he is such an empathetic person, I'm honestly not there yet.

SO breaks down, upset that I can't put aside my feelings to see that he's hurting too. I see my therapist on Friday and this is something I definitely plan to address with her, but if ya'll have any tips on dealing with that aspect, please share!

Then, after we get home, I get a text from Heimdall asking if I'd wear some earrings she sent me a picture, but I was polite and flowery with my ""no, thanks"" and she responds saying that she hopes we have a good weekend. I told SO that I was not having a good weekend because of Heimdall and FFIL's actions and he agreed.

&amp;#x200B;

Guys, I just... I don't know what to do or how to handle all of these hurts. Compared to what I see in a lot of these posts, they're minor, but they still hurt me and I am dealing with some feelings that were brought up in therapy recently about my own family (extended) neglecting me and me feeling like I don't belong and the last thing I want is to feel that way for the rest of my life with SO's family. I got enough of it growing up, cut down my connections to VLC with extended family, but doing that with his family would mean not having a relationship with FFIL or FSIL3 since the 3 of them are a package deal (FSIL1&amp;2 are out of the house). It hurts me to see how SO is affected by this. My family has welcomed him with open arms and that pains him because his family isn't like that with him or with me. It's just a lot of pain that's not been given time to heal since we've both been experiencing it separately since childhood.

Any advice on how to approach this situation with SO, Heimdall, or all of the above would be helpful.",JUSTNOMIL
"So...get this my one.

I made a post of the book of drama that was a simple thank you to my JYMIL and my D(ear)H for a wonderful memorial day. It was just a simple post of thanking my MIL for spending the day showing me things in a garden and we created two new flower beds at the house. (We live in a mother daughter combo she has the top part we have the bottom its awesome) 

So as you can guess my mother never did any of that with me. So of course maybe five minutes after the post goes who calls my phone asking for a visit?  If you guessed FFF- give your self a cookie.
Here's the convo

FFF: so hey why don't you come visit me and we can come do fun stuff to?

(Remember she still has not apologized for her behavior on mothers day)

Me: You have never wanted to do ""fun"" stuff with me. Why the sudden interest now?

FFF: WELL if his mom gets to do fun stuff with you then I should to.

Me: well his mom treats me like a daughter, maybe you should as well and begin with am apology for your behavior on mothers day. 

FFF: I only said what I thought you know I don't have a brain to mouth filter. Still you should come visit me.

Me: that's not an excuse you know better, and why would I go and visit with (abuser) still living in your house? Visits go both way. If you want to see me I can recommend hotels nearby for you and nephew. You know the rules. 

Fff: well. Maybe I just have to see we have blah blah bulshit....

Me: ok I got to go MIL is going to show me how to make a dinner dish ,give my nephew a hug bye.

Then I get several angry text about how I won't come see her....hell no I won't. 

I face time with my nephew, I don't want to be stuck with a woman who is more emotionally unstable then a tornado.  She plays the I'm the victim you won't come see me... 

Nope. I deserve to keep my sanity in tact. Besides my stepdaughter has a double header softball game this weekend- best believe I will be there being here number one fan filling up my camera supporting her.

"My MIL got off the phone a little while ago w my fiance soon to be DH (in 2 Wks). MIL was trying to convince DFH to name our LO Elizabeth after her mother. Which ai hate and so does he. He gently let her down bc he says the more firm you are with her, the combative she becomes. I've only met them a handful of times they live in Arizona we are in NYC. So she called me but I'm already pissed at my own mother and I'm 22 wks and am in no condition to bullshit people.

 She said: ""You know it would mean so much to me if you were to name my grandchild Elizabeth"" 

I said: ""Didn't DFH just tell you no? Isn't that what he said? (She tried to interrupt, I cut her off) Did you think if you called me w you sickly sweet voice that I would somehow cave bc I can assure you all your doing is pissing me off, and tap dancing on my last nerve"" 

She said: "" Well I feel I should have some sort of say in my grandchild's naming"" 

Side-Note This woman has bullied her other DILs into naming their children names she has picked out. Wrong bitch wrong time wrong day

I Said: ""Your feelings are irrelevant, you are not the parent

She said:"" I'm the grandmother

I said: ""Yes the parent of be one of the parents, 'Grand' once removed, know your role. You can visit, dote on, spend time with our child as we as her parents deem acceptable but please do not think your job is to raise our daughter, it is not. So no you do not get a say in what we name her; is strictly between me and her dad.

I continued: "" Is there anything else you want to say, she silent, Ill take that as a no and just say goodnight and then I hung up.

I know I.might have been harsh but with all I'm going through I just don't have the patience. My DFH is on the phone w her telling her she should not have upset me considering my condition. He's beyond pissed but honestly I'm fine I said what I meant and I truly meant what I said.

"Mil has now learned she should contact DH to make plans with DD1. 

It’s causing me a great deal of anxiety because I do not want her with the kids alone. I have past posts but I deleted a few of them.

It’s not that she is terrible with the kids but she does a lot of small things I’m not okay with that just add up. 

Another thing is she will probably to take her to visit ‘uncle’ because they missed her at Sunday dinner. He is an old pervert. Thinks if girls wear less clothes it’s his right to stare. I caught him checking out high school girls at a restaurant. He says disturbing things all the time. I hate being around him. Sometimes I call his BS and as my daughter gets older mama bear will be out.

I have not expressed this to DH and sometimes I feel like I’m being unreasonable with this. 

He let me know before I picked her up from daycare that MIL will be getting her today because she wants to have dinner with her.

I’ve skipped Sunday dinner because seeing her once a friggen week is enough and we don’t need to see her anymore than that. It’s really pissing me off because she constantly wants us or kids over. 

Another thing is she *tells* plans instead of asking permission. I’m not sure what she was said with DH. 

I’ve been getting DH to do all the communication with her so this is a new situation for me. Of course he isn’t going to say no because he doesn’t see her behaviour as a problem.

I’m trying to let it go today. I usually make up excuses if she tries to take her or we have plans in place. 

Someone calm me down. Am I overreacting and blinded by my annoyance of her?",JUSTNOMIL
"So I'm newly pregnant after trying to conceive for four years and my NMom just referred to my babies (we're pretty sure there's two in there) as her babies. She has no boundaries and treats my sister and I like an extension of herself. She is also borderline personality. I gently texted back to her, these are my babies, (sister) and I are yours. She's been super weird (acting very stiff, formal, punishing me basically) since.
What else can I do to help her realize that behavior isn't appropriate? Am I totally out of line?",JUSTNOMIL
"I’ve been lurking on here for awhile and finally had the courage to post! There is lots of stories about my alcoholic jnmom so maybe I’ll post old ones in the future. 

TIGGER WARNING FOR SUICIDE MENTIONING. 

So backstory:

My bf (21) and I (20) have been together for about 4 years now. My JNmom has never liked him, as you can guess bc she racist against black ppl. She would always try to manipulate me into breaking up with him. Calling him a liar, scum, Ex. she looked did a background check on him and “he had a court date, so he must be a bad guy!” And when I tried to tell her it was bc he didn’t have his insurance papers in the car when he was pulled over. “Well he’s definitely lying to you, his KIND OF PPL always lie!” Ugh. We would get into fights about little things like a shirt on the ground and it would just blow up and she always brought him into saying that “he was bringing me down a dark path with the devil.” Every time we get into a fight it ends in “well I should just kill myself and you’ll be happy right” or trying to hit herself in the head with a heavy object. She’s called my a n***** lover so many times I can’t even count and when I go “how can you say something so racist” she will always say that the hard r word isn’t prejudice against black ppl is just means ignorant. 🙄 or when she sobered up she’ll say “ you know what happens when I drink, the devil comes inside me.”  just crazy bullshit is all that ever comes out of her mouth. 

So I turned 18 and I moved out with BF, and went very LC. She started going on about that she has acted that way bc she doesn’t know him very well and if she got to know him she could trust him with her daughter. Even though he has offered multiple times to take her out to dinner and get to know each other in the past. He has tried everything for her to like him. And I know that was bc she just wanted to see me and keep her control over me but, I did want a relationship with her bc you only have 1 mom. So she would never be alone with him but we would take her out with us on our date nights to include her. And she still says some subtle racist shit and just demeaning stuff over the last year and half. Like “ did you pay rent on time? Did BF help? He’s not mooching off you is he? You know you have an escape route, you can just move back in.” 

So last night I got a drunk voicemail from her. First thing she says is “OP, I have a black bf now.   He’s coming over right now.” She’s saying it so proud like she won a prize. It’s disgusting. She then goes on to say that she can’t be prejudice now bc she’s fucking a black man. This whole voicemail disgusts me because she so proud of it, and like she expects me to be proud of her or something. 
I just don’t know what to do about it bc I want to just go NC but at the same time I still want my mom. I feel so bad for BF bc I know what she says hurts him so badly and he’s such a saint that he’s never asked me to go NC and when I tell him something she said he just goes “well I just have to try harder”. We have a lot of issues that stem from childhood, that I have forgiven her for bc she was in a mentally and physically abusive relationship with my ex step dad. But she has no excuse now, even though alcohol is her excuse. Help?",JUSTNOMIL
"And it's going just the way I initially imagined it would.. need to get through these next few months and I hope I can get general get-along-daily advice here. 

My husband and I have been married a year, and I recently went through some trouble with my credit that has left us with my husband's credit alone to buy a home. Renting was bleeding us dry of any extra savings. The market in our area for homes in our budget is crazy due to recent wide scale flooding. We need to have money for the down payment AND closing costs to make a serious offer. Sooo my husband convinced me that we could stand living with the in laws long enough (3-6 months) to save what we need. 

I immediately mentioned some issues that I could see living here (oof, I saw this coming) and he told me that they would give us space and we could have boundaries firmly set. I don't know why I figured Crappy Snappy would all the sudden be JustYes but I suppose I've always been a dreamer (and sufferer of nightmares ironically.)

To top it off.. we're pregnant! When I say that, I mean it in the sense that my MIL has literally mentioned her having sympathy fatigue and that ""she's getting a sympathy belly"" (bizarre considering her figure has always been the way it currently is) and is treating this pregnancy like it's hers. 

I'm only 8 weeks and she's already trying to touch my belly without asking me first. She often does it when intoxicated which triggers me even more. She got mad when I pulled away from the last super unbearable interaction. She has already told me she's going to throw my shower (didn't ask) and that while it's all about me, I won't be able to help with planning or decisions about anything besides registries. When I asked her why, she told me it's her first grandchild. When I reminded her it's my FIRST CHILD, she just looked at me. 

She then made a comment: ""I know you're not used to letting people help you, or having people do things for you, but I *actually* want to plan it."" This was a dig at my mother. During wedding planning I told my MIL in confidence about my mom's agoraphobia and how she has a hard time with social events, and ever since, she uses it as an insult backhandedly all the time. 

The conversation ended when my little brother-in-law and his friend joined us, so that's something I look forward to having to deal with in the future. 

Now I know some people would probably point out that I probably should just avoid her when she's drinking, but like many midwestern (I'm sure it's everywhere btw not just my shit state) mothers, she drinks nightly basically when she gets home from work. She gets even more intoxicated on weekend days/nights depending on what various seasonal drinking event is happening. 

Any other advice is greatly appreciated. I do understand I need to just remove myself from certain situations but I can't always do that. 

BTW, my husband sees her behavior as a HUGE problem too, but just doesn't want to deal with it head on while we're still living here. He is probably right, she does not handle confrontation well and I think she'd kick me out (she has before //edit to clarify, during wedding planning we argued about something she told me to get the hell out of her house. I have not been kicked out yet during current stay.)",JUSTNOMIL
"My BIL was the first of the siblings to get married, and give my MIL grandkids, and throughout the entire process, she would say that ""I've never seen a freshly born baby"" (both her sons where C-section back in the day when the mother was doped up six ways from Sunday, so both were seen by her several hours after delivery). And kept hinting a desire to be in the delivery room with my SIL when she gave birth, something that they got around by the fact that they lived in a different state, and that they didn't immediately disclose the due date until she was already in the hospital. 

Now my MIL continues to mention ""I've never seen a freshly born baby"" whenever we see her, to the point where I don't want to tell her that I'm 7 weeks, because she lives two hours away by car, and there isn't a distance obstacle preventing her from being in the waiting room.   
There is the added concern that at present, my expected due date is my MIL's birthday.  


DH and I always dodged the question in the past, but now its something we can no longer avoid.  


But we don't know how.",JUSTNOMIL
"I'm one of those people who will literally never understand people who think they are entitled to another person's money/things when that person dies. Sorry if my view offends anyone but just wanted to get that out there.

My JNMIL's father passed away. It was unexpected, but he was old. He lived a good life. He had 3 children with JNMIL's mother and they divorced. He remarried. His second wife has 2-3 kids I think, not really sure. Now I went through drama with kids and stepkids when my own grandmother and step grandfather passed away. I know it can get messy.

JNMIL contacted DH and ask what she could do to stop her father's stepkids from getting any money. I don't want to go into detail and give myself away but there may be quite a bit more money than was expected. From what I understand his will states that everything goes to his current wife. And I think it should. Who knows how long she'll live and she'll need the support.

However, JNMIL already has her stepmother dead in her mind and wants to know what she'll be getting once her stepmother's estate is settled. I was super pissed at JNMIL when DH told me about this. I know JNMIL's father was VERY close with his stepkids. I can't see any situation where he wouldn't have wanted to split the estate with them and his bio kids should his wife had passed first.

But of course, selfish JNMIL wants to know what's in it for her. My guess? She wants money so she can pay for golden grandchild to go to super expensive preschool.",JUSTNOMIL
"So, last Friday Louise called my fiancé, as she does every Friday. My fiancé doesn’t work on Friday’s and it’s the perfect time to call and talk at/with him or whatever. 

So I guess when she called though, it was to complain about my relationship with her. She feels like I’m very snippy with her and short and it makes her sad. She doesn’t want our relationship to be like her and her own mother-in-law, which was strained. 

Frankly, I felt like my cordial and not close relationship with her was working. I don’t want to be close with her because I feel like that means she’ll be constantly talking at me and over me and making everything about her. I’m not a fan. 

The snippiness might be true, because yeah, if she interrupts someone to talk about herself, I’ll tell her to wait for someone to finish. Because it’s rude of her. 

Apparently she wanted to complain because I was sick when I came over, the time before. I told my FSIL before Louise called that I just gotten my blood tests back and it was Mono. (For reference, is only contagious via saliva.) I was deathly ill the week before but was on the upswing when I came, and nearly better. 

Instead of asking me how I was feeling, she simply messaged “Do you have mono?” It took me aback because it was so out of the blue and sharp, and when I told her yes she never responded. Apparently my being sick upset her and she felt like she should have known that I had it. But I didn’t even get the tests done until after our visit. It frankly hurt my feelings that she never asked about me when everyone is expected to dote over her for her fucking iron deficiency. 

Also (here’s the kicker), she is “having a hard time sharing” my fiancé. Now, I’m not sure how to take this. My fiancé is the youngest in the family, and sure, it must be hard to see your littlest grow up and start a life. But also HE IS NOT A “THING” to share. It felt possessive at least, and creepy at worst. When we were over last, she made a big scene of kissing his cheek and calling him her baby, in front of me. 

And I might be imagining this, I really might, but she made eye contact with me after, and it was like she was claiming him. It was so strange. I might be making this up in my head because I’m in a defensive state, but that’s how it felt. And since his adult life, my fiancé is not a mama’s boy at all, and it felt out of character for her to do.

Tell me if I’m overreacting, or if there’s anything to be done. My fiancé kind of already confronted the situation, and boundaries are still in tact, 
But I want to know if I’m in the wrong or if I should do something. 

Thanks guys!",JUSTNOMIL
"Haven't posted in a while, added a TLDR to bottom. 

Small Backstory:

I've been with SO (M29) for 7 years now. I consider his family, my family. His mother and I had it out about 2 years ago that I went NC with her as did my SO. I will still talk to FIL and the rest of the family but I was very distant from her even at family gatherings at FGMIL house. FMIL kicked out SO while he was in school for his bachelors. She didn't know he was in school for his bachelors and backtracked that she wouldn't have kicked him out if she knew he was going to school and he could stay. SO said no, because this is the second time she has kicked him out on her own notion and he's never coming back. Cue CBF. 

I did a lot to get ourselves situated and now we are doing very well for ourselves together. My SO is LC with his mom, I am now, considering VLC but that's because of a change that I've noticed which will be in another story but probably for JNFamily because of FSIL.

Situation:

Mother's day just passed. I have had SO's mother blocked on FB. She's been blocked for years. FFIL is not blocked on my Facebook and he sees all the things SO and I have been doing. He mentions something off chance that we're out doing something and notices that on FMIL's facebook, she tried to tag all the kids in a Mother's Day post, cannot tag my SO because she deleted him back when FMIL and I had the falling out. So FFIL is kind of miffed because SO is excluded and he asks why and basically harasses my SO until it comes out that this wasn't just recently this was from 2 years ago. My SO isn't on Facebook often so he could care less. Well, SO adds his mother back, and FFIL has this idea that I should add her back as well. 

SO comes up to me and says that maybe I should re-add his mother on Facebook. I look at him with the most deadpan face I can muster and ask, ""For what?"" We go back and forth with this about why I should add her:

&gt;SO: Well My dad wants you to add her back  
&gt;  
&gt;Brya: Your dad's not my father, so no.   
&gt;  
&gt;SO: Well she's my mother and it's mother's day.  
&gt;  
&gt;Brya: Yea, and she's not MY mother, that's your mother. Not my problem.  
&gt;  
&gt;And this is where shit escalates between SO:  
&gt;  
&gt;SO: Well what if we have kids and you still have this problem?  
&gt;  
&gt;Brya: Well, my grandmother (My father's mom) and my mother never got along. They hated each other with a burning passion but their problems never stopped me from seeing my grandmother or having a relationship with her.   
&gt;  
&gt;SO: Well, I think you need to figure it out especially if we want to get marri-  
&gt;  
&gt;Brya: Don't you dare fucking say that when we literally went through an entire conversation a few months ago about how you believe marriage isn't for you based on how you feel about all your other married friends and their lives have been shitty together except for 2 couples we know. So don't try to back peddle and make it about your mother because that's fucking stupid and you know it. I can be and I have been cordial with her since the situation at any family gathering. Her pulling that bullshit, ""I don't know where I stand with Brya..."" She knows EXACTLY where she stands, your father is just being her fucking flying monkey right now and guilting you into talking to me about his wife. He has my fucking number, FFIL can call me and ask me to unblock her and I'd give him the same response of ""No"" because it's my facebook and I do what I want. 

\-

It's been an hour since that happened. SO came in, talked to me and he agreed that it is my facebook and that I should be able to do as I want because it's not like his mother has been trying to reach out to me. 

I'm not being over the top about this though right? Like, it's MY stuff. Fuck off.

TLDR: My FMIL was being a pain in the ass on my FB, so I blocked her 2 years ago. FFIL finds out that SO and I have her blocked on both of our profiles and pressures SO into getting me to unblock her even with her shitty behavior.",JUSTNOMIL
"I'm getting married in just over 20 days, and I had to uninvite my own mother from the wedding last week for going on a MOBzilla rampage that ended in her nuking our relationship completely. It was absolutely nuts, and put a wrench in a lot of the wedding plans that we've been scrambling to get done as is.

But that's another much longer JustNo story, that I won't get into right now.

Basically it's been a REALLY ROUGH week, and I totally had an emotional breakdown yesterday.

I can't eat or drink because of how nauseous I am with anxiety, so I'm losing weight which everyone has been making negative comments about. I'm breaking out and getting migraines from all the stress I'm under, and I can't stop crying at the drop of a hat. I'm a mess. 

JNMIL upon hearing how rough my week has been, while knowing that I suffer from severe diagnosed depression and anxiety, took it upon herself to go out of her way to be a callous mean girl again, and downplay everything. Because that's the only contribution she's capable of making to anything wedding related...or otherwise. 

This morning I woke up to a text from her first thing:

*Morning!
You prob have pre-wedding blues lol.
You'll be fine. Just rest while you can, cuz the BIG day will be here soon enough.*

This might come off more BEC to y'all, but it was enough to start my day off with my heart immediately sinking into my stomach. It was not something I needed to hear, and she definitely knew better. 

 Downplaying/invalidation is a huge trigger for me, and honestly who says that to a stressed and depressed bride that already struggles with her mental /emotional health. It was just completely unhelpful, out of nowhere, and couldn't have had worse timing. 

Like, she might as well have said

""Oh your life is falling apart right before the most important day of it? You'll get over it. Or at least you better... since it's right around the corner...LOL""

I'll also add that literally every time MIL interacts with ANYONE, she turns it into a pity party for herself and her own mental/emotional issues. So it's not like she's just oblivious to how this kind of thing feels, she's extremely self centered and apparently being depressed is a competition that only she can win. 

Maybe the next time she throws one of those infamous parties, I'll tell her she just has the blues and that she'll be fine ""LOL""... You know instead of being comforting and empathetic, like I've always been towards her. 

I would just ignore this little jab, but my irritation won and I sent her this instead:

*Honestly, the pre-wedding blues?... I don't think so.
It also didn't help waking up first thing in the morning, to my severe depression being downplayed.
But sure, I'll be just fine. Thanks.*

I just don't have the capacity for her minutiae, and of course now she's going belly up saying it was just a joke (because I'm totally in a place right now where unprompted jokes are appropriate)... making me the asshole here.

"So an update to my MIL. She is now no longer talking to me... Because well, I have no idea. She got mad that I called her on her bs, but now she refuses to talk to me... Its werid.

I sort of feel responsible, and, like I should do something about it, but I don't know what to do.

Also, the day after I got mad at her, she fell down some stairs, severely injuring herself... I am sure it happened, but her son did not come to her, so... I'm sure she is pissed as well.

Also, what she said hurt me, and I don't want it to sink into my brain.

"It’s been many years now, the cat has been looking like death since ‘13. I remember going away for 3 months that summer and being almost positive she’s die before I got back. Especially since my mother isn’t the best with making sure water is available. But she’s still alive. I still remember the day we got her.

I was probably 9 years old and had wanted a cat forever. We had a dog and my mother didn’t want both at the same time again so she kept telling me I could have a cat when the dog was dead. I remember feeling so terrible when he died, because I also felt happy.

Of course once the dog was dead I wasn’t allowed to get a cat. Because reasons. 9 year old me really, really wanted a cat so when a good friend had kittens I claimed one. My mother reluctantly agreed and from the 5 kittens she had, I could pick one. There was a completely black, completely white and three red once. They where all beautiful and so cute and everybody got up in my business about which one to pick. So I picked the one no one wanted me to take, the white one.

Now in my language “wit” means white and you can add “je” to almost every word to make it little (book would be boek and boekje, when talking about a little book, fiets becomes fietsje when it’s little). Obviously a color can’t be big or little, which makes “Witje” sound like a name instead of color.

No one wanted the white cat, no one wanted to call her Witje. I did. 9 year old me thought it was super cute. But then my mother wanted to call her Pippi. Random out of nowhere she decided to name the cat Pippi.

I made a big stink about how it was my cat and how I was going to feed her and change the litter box and everything. My mother didn’t care but eventually agreed that I should have a vote but so should she. 1 vs 1 didn’t get us anywhere so my sisters and her partner got a vote too. And she definitely got more votes.

I was so mad. I could already see myself having a cat for what felt like forever with a name I didn’t like. Having to use that name every day. So I ran to my neighbors, explained what was happening and got one of my best friends and her two sisters to come over and help me. I turned the vote in my favor and my mother tried the “they can’t vote, it’s not their car” which I countered with “it’s not theirs either” (referring to my sister).

Long story short, about 20 years later I live next door to my mother, we share a garden and the cat pretty much lives in that garden. At night she enters our home, during the day she avoids it due to the kids (the oldest pointing and yelling “poes!” like a crazy person every time he sees her).

In 2013 she got a dog, mostly because I really wanted us to keep the dog. It was never going to be my dog, so I wasn’t really supposed to name it. No one was, we just had the dog and her tiny dogs stay with us until they could be seperated from their mother. But that last one didn’t have a home yet so she stayed with us after the adult dog got picked up by her owners. I named her Foo Foo Cuddlypoop. Because why not, it’s a cute and funny name.

My mother still has the dog, but she renamed it. She renamed it Wodka and tried very hard to make that my son’s first word. I still call her Foo.

Side note: my mother her partner suggested a russian word that ment black. If I hadn’t been so focussed on naming my own cat, I would have seen how awesome that was. I even sort of did back then, but I felt I couldn’t use it because I had been making such a big stink about it being MY cat and me wanting to name it myself.

It’s not the same as all the MILs and moms naming their grandchildren, but as a 9 year old I felt really powerless. She seemed to take pleasure in the tantrum I threw when it looked like I wasn’t getting my way.",JUSTNOMIL

"This woman!

Last I posted, Rabbit was sitting on a beach down south, at an all-inclusive stay at her life-long friend’s house.

She’s been there, ignoring me, since Christmas holidays when she got baked and staggering drunk in front of my teen son.  She was in top form, let me tell ya’.  I did not react (though I was disgusted), because all I could think about was the shock and disappointment on my DS1’s face.

Been there, kid.  Been there!

Anyhow, she was offended by my coldness.  (She’s very perceptive, even through her drug-induced stupor.) She’s ignored my emails, texts, and IG messages (only once per month).

In fact, she didn’t even tell me when her friend, like a second mother to me, passed away unexpectedly in either February or March.  I’m still not sure when.

So, Rabbit has been sitting and smoking doobies on a beach, in a foreign country, as a fugitive from immigration because her host fucking died and Rabbit just stayed...for months!

I received an email from Rabbit yesterday.  The tone is very light, and social, like we’re been in contact this whole time.

It goes something like, “Hi there, Sweetie!  Just a note to let you know I’m flying home tomorrow.  I have a stopover in your town, but I’m afraid I can’t visit this time.  TTFN! Love Mumsy!”

"Real Estate is my JNMom, OB = Older Brother, YB = Younger Brother    
  
Hello all, it's been a minute since I posted. A while back on RBN, I told the story of Real Estate kicking me out of the house for wanting my laptop back. That was a pivotal moment in my mental health journey, because it made me realize just how cold and insensitive and selfish she could truly be. It's been at least 3 years since that incident, and it still comes up in my mind. I'm not trying to hold a grudge, I just...can't move past it because of its gravity for me on a personal level.  
  
Fast-forward to this past weekend, where we've traveled to the opposite side of the country to attend a family member's wedding. Much rejoicing, but also much fighting. OB and Real Estate get into it, and I back him up. I feel strong, I respond to her instead of shrinking away. I get told at the wedding by a cousin that, ""now you're an adult, I can say this: *you survived.*"" I get validation from family like I never have before.  
  
Then, Monday. She asks me for advice on how to help OB. He has some problems in his life (not drugs or such, just life planning type things) at the moment that I won't go into because they're not mine to share. And then, inevitably, she turns to me. She talks about how my parents need to be more involved in my school stuff because I've had a couple of bad semesters and obviously I need to be talking to someone about my assignments throughout the semester and checking in with someone.  
  
Somehow, we get to a point where I say, ""you've told me that we were terrible children"" and she says she didn't. Then I say that she did during the laptop incident, and she goes quiet, then says maybe. Then it happens.  
  
""You were being terrible, though!""  
  
And I lose it. I 100% absolutely lose it, because that incident was majorly fucked up for me, and she just said that, and I can't just stay silent. At the time, she came in when I was clearly mid-anxiety attack and told me that she couldn't believe she had raised such selfish children. And then told me to leave because she needed me out of the house.  
  
I go through the points, I say ""I let you borrow my computer for a specific thing, and then you kept using it after that, and I asked for it back and we fought about it and then you made me leave. YB had to drive me around the island while I was sobbing because I couldn't calm down.""  
  
She says, ""I know that but I don't know how to fix it,"" and ""I hope I didn't ruin your life. Maybe we can't have a relationship.""  
  
And I can't respond, because how do you respond to that? Say, ""yeah, I don't think we can?""  
  
Later that night, I find out that my SO's extended family member who I knew fairly well has suddenly passed away. They were young and this was in no way predictable. I tell my parents because I don't want Real Estate bursting in on my room and demanding that I socialize, prompting me to yell at her and pulling this tragic event into our personal family drama. They both express sympathy and shock.  
  
The next day (yesterday), I'm wandering around the house in a daze. We're at Real Estate's deceased mother's house, and I see reminders of her everywhere. Her death was traumatic for me and only makes my current feelings worse. Whenever I act sad, Real Estate rolls her eyes or gives me what I call the ""my sensitive daughter is at it again"" expression. She imitates me mockingly when I ask for something in a quiet tone, then defends her actions by saying that I need to stop talking like a baby. That night, I decide I need to fly home early because I can't be here and around her, and because I need to support my SO in person. The original flight was next week, I get my dad to help me change to Thursday.  
  
So here I am, wondering about her relationship comment. Wondering if I should even bother to continue to maintain. I've gotten better at calling her out, and standing up for myself, but it's still fucked up and I don't know if I can continue to maintain. I don't even know if I should. I know I can't cut ties yet because of my school and my property that's at my parents' home, but in the future. I'm nearly 25 and I don't want to be spending the next quarter of my life focused on her in the same way I spent my first.  
  
TL;DR: Real Estate says she doesn't know if we can even have a relationship, and to be honest, I don't know either.",JUSTNOMIL
"I’m not posting this for attention or sympathy. I genuinely want to know if I’m in the wrong for cutting her off and keeping her out of my life. This one is a doozy, so if you read it all, you deserve a cookie. Any kind you'd like.

I'm 32 now, for reference. My relationship with my mother, for as long as I can remember, has been extremely up and down. She had me on social security for disability for far longer than necessary. I did have Autism as a child, specifically Echolalia, that where instead of formulating my own responses to people, I would mimic them as if I were a parrot. I'm still disabled according to social security and could claim disability benefits if I wanted to, but I haven't and don't plan to abuse the system like she clearly has. 

As I got older, I noticed that every time I dated someone, her treatment of myself got worse. Naturally, when I met and dated my husband, I bet you can imagine the treatment of me got. Then we got engaged and married. She was so money hungry that she forced us to take out unnecessary student loans when we were attending community college so we have student loan debt that we honestly may not even have if it wasn't for her. She also took out credit cards in our names and screwed with both our credits. I managed to successfully dispute what she's done to me, but my husband and I have had to pay his debts and our scores are finally back in the fair, almost good range. When she doesn't get her way, she yells, threatens, and just all around makes our lives miserable. 

She then commits bigamy in 2009 by marrying a black guy 30 years her junior. My older sister and I are both older than the guy. That's how young he is. He has been unfaithful to her so many times and has had so many indiscretions with girls under the age of 18. He has even hit on my older sister and tried to solicit me to be his side chick. HER OWN CHILDREN. [EDIT: I only mention her ""husband's"" race and age for context. My ex prior to my husband was mixed with Puerto Rican, black, and white and my mother exhibited serious racist behavior towards him, then she turns around and marries a black man, ergo becoming a hypocrite in every sense of the word. No other reason than that.]

The relationship with her sank to an all time low back in February 2014 when I moved out a month earlier than when I told her because that's when my husband procured the lease for the townhome we were going to share with our best friends. She proceeded to extort up to about $10k out of me or she'd file charges on me for damages to the house when we moved out (which was bullshit, we didn't damage or mess up shit, but we didn't take photos either as evidence). She even charged me $500 for my dog when I had been the one taking care of him since he was a puppy. 

Fast forward to March 2015, my husband left for boot camp for the Marines. I was barely communicating with her. I did use her to help me purchase a beater car. I had the funds to pay for the car in full, but I wouldn't have had any back up funds for emergencies while my husband was gone. So I had to pay her back for that, which was fine, I did pay her back for the car. 

Once I was done paying for the car, she was supposed to sign the title over to me. She never did. I ended up moving down to South Carolina when my husband got military orders for end of September of that year. During the first couple of days there, there was heavy rain and water must've got into the engine because the car started having major issues. By July 2016, the car was pretty much done for. I flew back home to OH to get the title so I could trade it in or junk it and get a new car. She gave me the excuse that the title was in FL at my grandma's home. I just flew back home early and shrugged it off. I finally bought a new car that October and finally found a junk yard that would let me junk it following a vin check. I have texts and emails from her proving that she knew and approved of me junking the car. I sent her the receipt of the junking twice. I found out later that she reported the car stolen to the police department in Columbus and committed insurance fraud and filing a false police report. Thankfully, she didn't try to say that I stole the car, I have my evidence and would happily turn her in if she tried to pin it on me. 

Once I was done being extorted, I kept records of everything I sent her, I pretty much minimized communication with her. Fast forward to June of last year, my older sister was urgently trying to get in touch with me. I thought it was for my mother's whims, so I didn't get back to her. She tries again in October. I finally respond and find out what the emergency was. My baby sister came forward and revealed that her husband molested her when she was 13 and tried again when she was 16. Her story has never changed. My mother called her a liar to her face and is still with the piece of shit child molester. As soon as I find out, I immediately block her off of everything and haven't spoken to her since. 

I find out I'm pregnant with mine and my husband's first and only child in January. The only family member I tell, once I'm past 12 weeks, is my grandmother, because she's done nothing wrong. But while she still talks to my mother, I don't communicate with her much. I get photos done with my husband to announce the pregnancy and I hid the post from my grandma on facebook because my mother is notorious for hacking her facebook, but I totally overlook instagram. So she hacks into her instagram and leaves a victim like comment on my announcement post. I deleted the comment and had no choice but to remove my grandma as a follower on instagram. My grandma did NOT tell her I’m pregnant and hasn’t told her anything pertaining to my pregnancy. Given all the history I just laid out, am I in the wrong for keeping my mother away from myself and my baby. 

I’d enclose the SS of what she left on IG, but it’s not letting me. So here’s what she said. 

“U block me on IG and FB and don’t tell me you’re preggo? Not only am I hurt, but totally disillusioned that U wouldn’t tell me I’m about to have my first grandchild! No matter what, I still love U, even though it seems you have lost the same feelings for me. I had to hear it from
my mom!”",JUSTNOMIL

Long time lurker, first time poster. This is gonna be a long one, so buckle up!

TLDR at the bottom.

My MIL isn't a complete JN, but has a few JN tendencies. 

One of these tendencies is Baby Rabies. Boy oh boy does she have 'em.

My D(ear)H and I have been dating since high school. So we've been together for about 8 years but have been married now for 2 years. We're still pretty young (25) but actually just bought a house together a few months ago.

Even though we're young, we've hit a lot of milestones that most MILs would probably read as the logical pathway to \~ggrranndbabbbbiieeesss\~. Now, my DH and I both agree that eventually, we will want a kiddo or two. For now though, we are enjoying life with each other and our fur baby (sorry no doggo pics because I'm paranoid about having this throwaway account discovered).  But I wouldn't be posting here if my MIL fully respected our wishes now would I?

To start, I wanted to try and describe my MIL a bit. 

1. My MIL likes to laugh. Which isn't bad in itself. But she likes to laugh at her own jokes and some of her jokes....just....aren't......funny. 

But that won't stop her from either 1. repeating the joke or 2. adding to the joke. It can be awkward so sometimes we'll just give a fake laugh so we can move along in the conversation. 

Within this same vein, she will pass off a lot of passive aggressive statements as jokes. 

You know that phrase, ""inside every joke is a nugget of truth""? Yeah, that's constantly running through my head when I'm around her. Usually I'll just give a half-hearted chuckle and make a mental note of what is *actually* being said. These ""jokes"" often fly over my DHs head so I will also bring them up with him once the call is over/they leave. 

2. She can also be kinda handsy/touchy. I am not a touchy person and I love my bubble space. The only person I'm not like this with is my DH. But MIL likes to really put her face close to yours when talking if you're sitting next to each other? It's a very odd phenomenon that's hard to describe. She will also do little things like patting/touching your knee or shoulder. I've also had her touch my waist when she was complementing an outfit I was wearing. (NOTE: I am really weird about being touched. I once had a friend hug me and notice that I immediately stiffened up at being touched. I don't realize when I do that and I really didn't mind that friend hugging me. I swore it was ok after that friend began to profusely apologize, so I concede that part of this issue could be me lol)

3. She also has a habit of bringing up sensitive topics and then getting mad when we don't agree with her/call her out. Both MIL and FIL are republicans and my DH and I are pretty darn far left so as you can imagine, this happens more so than not lol Which is so annoying, because she could've easily avoided being admonished by not bringing up the sensitive topic! (This is kinda how, in a fit of anger, I came out of the closet to them but that's a story for another time. Any fellow pans in here?)

4. My MIL is religious. She's not one to shove jesus quotes down your throat but she is one of those folks that think Christianity is the one and only religion so of course everyone should follow that religion. 2 years ago, me and DH visited for Christmas and were while playing a board game. She randomly asked us, ""You believe in GOD don't you?"". DH and I are pretty agnostic/druids so we just kinda skirted the question by advising that no, we don't believe in the christian god and hey, lets get back to the game. She didn't love that answer but she did drop it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Besides these super rad characteristics (/s) she can be a very nice MIL. She and my FIL have helped me a lot when I fell on some hard times and we can all get along really well (especially when we pull out Settlers of Catan!). Now, DH and I moved about 9 hours from them about 2 years ago. Besides some holidays, MILs main method of contact is through the phone. She calls my DH about once a week. He'll usually put her on speakerphone and I can decide if I feel like speaking with her or not. I have no problem with these calls as it's a nice way for them to stay in contact with all their kids (I'm pretty certain both FIL and MIL are feeling some empty nest syndrome).  

&amp;#x200B;

Now that you kinda have a feel for her, here are some of the baby rabies instances that I can remember:

\-MIL asked a general question about grandbabies. We responded that we want time for ourselves/still want to travel so wouldn't have them soon. MIL said something along the lines of, ""oh that's ok, you can just drop baby off with me and go on your vacations hahahahahahaha""

\-MIL was talking with us on the phone and we somehow started talking about who in our friend group is married/has kids. DH said something along the lines of, ""oh give it 10 years and most will probably have kids"". MIL jokingly said, ""oh man, I sure hope I'm still alive by then! hahahaha"". (insert eyeroll here)

\-When one my friends was in labor, I was going grocery shopping with my MIL. I gave her little updates as well because she knew this friend. This compelled her to start telling me stories about how unhelpful her own MIL was when she was pregnant with DH and how she'll be much more helpful when I'm pregnant. Mind you, me and DH weren't even married at this time and definitely had no plans to get pregnant. 

\-Once when I was babysitting my niblings, MIL called me to go over airplane info (when me and DH were long distance she helped pay for us to still visit each other). During the call, I had to reprimand one of the kids and she said something along the lines of, ""You'll be such a great mother hahaha"".  At the time I just laughed it off but looking back on it, it's creepy since again, me and DH were still in college and not married/ready for kids. 

I know there other baby rabies moments that I can't remember right now. I think she pushes the idea of babies on us because DH is the most likely of her kids to have babies that she could *actually see* (her oldest kid is presently trying to start a family but lives overseas. Her middle child lives about as far as us but has a whooolleeee bunch of animals and probably isn't thinking about kids any time soon). 

&amp;#x200B;

Allll of this being said, me and DH actually get a chuckle out of all the babies rabies! lol

For instance, on 2 of the more recent occasions when she's asked about babies, we've replied with:

1. We're actually allergic to kids

2. That we are still practicing 

MIL and FIL will be coming for a visit in about a month  and we need more funny responses to give them when the questions start up!

DH has a super shiny spine (I'm working on mine, especially since finding this group) so I have no worries that when we do actually have kids, boundaries will be set when needed. So why not have a little fun till then? 

So please, comment your funniest responses!

TLDR: MIL has babies rabies. My DH and I need funny responses to her questions about when we'll have kids. ",JUSTNOMIL
"TW:CHILD ABUSE

New poster, on mobile so sorry if its confusing. DH (31) and I(29f) have two kids dd(3years) and ds(9 months). I'll probably add the stories of my jnmil later but I needed to get this particular one out.  A little back story, Jnmil has hated me from day one her reasoning is I'm white and have no ties to her home country. I have tried to get to know her and tell her about myself, she refused and told me that I was never going to be part of her family because I dont know her culture or her mother language (even though I've asked to be taught both, I get told no I'm white I dont need to know). 
Now DD and her dont have any type of relationship, she refused due to dd being mixed and that's supposedly just how things are. 
DS and her had somewhat of a bond, I say that because when she did come by (we live a couple hours away and shed just walk in like she owns the place), it only happened after DS was born. Before ds, it was like pulling teeth to get her around unless she needed to for appearance sake. 
Her last visit, she came inside barely said hi to DH (getting ready to go to work) and then walked into our bedroom (door was closed because I was feeding ds), looked at me like I insulted her family and yanked my son out of my arms. Then proceeded to the rest of the time she was there, not put him down, I couldnt touch him. Bedtime comes around and demands that ds sleeps with her. I refused and she called people (in my home) and telling them I'm keeping DS from her and I'm hiding stuff *cue confusion*
Last day (she was here for 2 days). Dd has a sensory issue, not exactly sure what it is yet, currently working on it. But she rocks when her emotions are high. Jnmil holds her down and then goes to strick dd. I'm close enough to intervene, I yell for her to leave dd alone, her rocking is fine (she does in on the couch) and not to hold her down. She gets all pissy with me, my friend comes over (preplanned visit, jnmil expects us to drop everything when she decides we are important enough to see). Jnmil acts all nice now, like a switch away turned. Friend saw ending of the situation. Friend and I go into the kitchen for a second and I go to check on my kids. As I'm walking down the hallway, I see jnmil lift her leg, reach to the other side of the couch and kick dd off it. She sees me, I'm in shock rn. Her response, was try to stop me from getting to dd ans tell me, I didnt want her next to me. Dd was not sitting close enough to even be able to touch jnmil. 
All of this happened while dh was at work, while he was home she was at least tolerable just making a lot of comments. I told dh, shes done. I told him it was his responsibility to talk to her as she intentionally ignores whatever I say. All this happened in October of last year, she has yet to come back but to my knowledge dh hasnt told her she is no longer welcomed in our home. He decided to cut ties with her after hearing everything shes done to the kids and I.",JUSTNOMIL
"A little backstory. My DH (at the time my BF) was sent to prison for 3 years and I found out I was pregnant a week later. We were overjoyed, so was MiL. I took the test at her house and she freaked out; screaming, crying saying she will always have a piece of her son. I should’ve taken that as a red flag. My DH and I decide to get married, we were going to wait until he got out but decided to just do it now and we can have a big ceremony when he comes home. Throughout my pregnancy she wanted to be apart of everything always wanting to be in the know, how I was every dr appt, always trying to give me advice. 
So, I go to the dr two days before my due date, they tell me I’m spilling protein in my urine so I have to go to the hospital to be monitored for a couple hours. I text her and she freaks out saying she’ll be coming down because “the baby will be born tonight” I tell her not to, we have no clue what they’re going to do yet. They send me home with a container to collect my urine in for 24 hours so we can test it again tomorrow. It’s 2:30 am and my water broke, I wait until the morning to go to the hospital and decide not to message her until later on. It’s about 3 pm now and I’m being placed into a room, I’m still 2 cm dilated, they’re starting me on pitocin. She’s blowing my phone up asking if I’m dilating every hour. I didn’t get to 5 cm until 10 pm. At this point I’m in so much pain waiting for the epidural. My mom is sitting in the delivery room with me and she says MiL is texting her asking her how I am and that she’s here at the hospital, asking what room I am. I tell the nurse to only let her stay for an hour at most. Another nurse walks her in and says “ your labor coach is here” WHAT we never talked about that. She brings in gifts, and starts taking pictures of me for her son. I’m in excruciating pain, hair in a bun, no makeup, sweating and she’s acting like this a fashion show. I close my eyes and try to focus on breathing. The nurse comes in and tells her I need to rest, I need quiet and no one in here. She says she will be quiet it will be like I’m not even here. Nurse comes back with Dr and dr says she needs to leave because they need to stabilize my BP. She leaves and before walking out, looks at my mom and says I guess keep me updated. Acting like she’s so hurt. I did not want her in there when it was time to push and I’m fully naked with her phone in my crouch taking pictures. I got the epidural and my mom informs her. She says the epidural is going to ruin my back that it’s very bad to not have children natural. My mom stops replying as we both have  had enough. It’s 5 am now and they’re going to pop the rest of my water because all of it didn’t come out. My mom informs again and MiL says the baby should be in water the whole time until pushing. My mom and I are so frustrated at this point. Does she really think they don’t know what they’re doing? It’s now 2:30 pm she’s still blowing up our phones. I’m pushing now and she texts my mom to tell her to make sure to capture right when her granddaughter comes out. I push for 2 hrs I end up needing to have a c section. She’s texting the whole time, saying that c section is very bad, it’s unnatural. Would you rather have both of us die? I think not. I have my DD and am wheeled into the recovery, I get to speak to my DH, he hears DD cry. Now I’m going into the PP room, where visitors can come. My family comes as well as her and it wasn’t horrible, everyone left in a timely manner. It’s the next day and she asks if she can come take more pictures I say yes. The time is now 11 pm and she comes with more gifts and clothes for her that are brand new haven’t been washed and puts them on her. I was in the restroom w/ nurses. My DD starts scream crying and I tell her it’s time for her to go it’s her bed time. (Duh, it’s now 1 AM!!!!!) MiL puts her pjs I brought back on my DD and I notice she has a rash all over her body because of those damn clothes. She leaves and I tell my DH the next day when he calls. He was so angry. Fast forward to  now, she hasn’t tried to come see her, thank God, she probably got the hint but wow. It was horrible.",JUSTNOMIL
"My wife and I both had to work yesterday, but our kids daycare was closed for Memorial Day, so we were left without a babysitter. On Saturday, my MIL told my wife the kids could spend the night on Sunday and she’d keep them Monday. That was fine by me, since I’d have to wake them up at 5am to get them ready if they didn’t spend the night. 

Monday evening rolls around. I arrive at the IL’s house  to pick up the kids. My son(5) comes running up to me for a hug like he usually does. I immediately notice his face is covered in a rash. I ask him “What happened to your face!?” My MIL is a fat lazy piece of shit, so she hadn’t noticed. I say “It looks like poison ivy or something.” My MIL says “They haven’t been near the woods, they’ve been in the pool all day, so I don’t think that’s it.” My son says “Yes, we did. We took Papa’s chainsaw into the woods behind the shed and cut up some trees.” My MIL acts like he was lying and commented he had a very active imagination. My son insists he was in the woods with a chainsaw, so I asked him to show me. 

We walked around back to the shed, and sure enough, there was an electric pruning saw back there beside a tree my FIL had cut down. The tree was covered in poison ivy vines. They had been pretending it was running, and just running the saw back and forth on the branches. 

I was pretty fucking angry. I went back inside and told my MIL that they had indeed been playing with a chainsaw, an electric chainsaw that could have been deadly if my FIL hadn’t left the electric cord unplugged inside the shed. She said she watched them all day and they were in the pool. They got out and “played in the yard for about 5 minutes” at one point, but she made them stay where she could see them. This stupid bitch had been sitting inside the house watching the kids play in the pool, and it was very obvious she hadn’t been paying attention to them at all if they had time to go play with a chainsaw in the woods behind the house. I was beyond pissed. My daughter is only 3 years old, and she let them play in a swimming pool with no adult supervision. My children could have easily drowned or bled to death from a chainsaw wound because this fat, lazy bitch though watching shitty b-roll movies on the hallmark channel was a higher priority than her grandchildren’s safety. 

I’ve always been respectful towards my MIL, even when she’s been a total bitch in the past. Today was different. I cursed her out and told her she wouldn’t be watching my kids anymore. I’d trust a perfect stranger to babysit them over her. I put the kids in the car and left. Didn’t say goodbye, didn’t get their shoes, didn’t get anything. If my mother hadn’t raised me to be the man I am, I would have slapped my MIL’s teeth out right there in her own living room.

My wife called me less than 5 minutes later, pissed off at me. Her mother called her ass soon as I left, crying. I told her exactly what happened, and she said her mother told her I cursed her out because he had poison ivy on his face. She completely neglected to tell her about the chainsaw or the unsupervised swim.  I could give a shit less about the stupid poison ivy. I can fix that with some cream from CVS. I can’t sew an arm back on or bring a drowned child back to life. She hung up with me and called her mother back and cursed her out herself. She’s tried calling a couple times today, but I just ignored the calls.",JUSTNOMIL
"First time, long time lurker.  Sorry if I make a mistake.  I'm having trouble with the flair but advice wanted.

My DH is his mom’s only child. She is some what attached and controlling/ manipulative but we live an hour plus away so I can typically avoid it. She is one of those that feels she needs more attention than others and wants people to emotionally cater to her. I have loads of stories but today I am going to try and focus on what has been bothering me since our visit on Saturday.

I apologize if this isn’t focused, I’ve been trying to organize my thoughts but it is funny how JNs have a way of scrambling your brain.

Background:

DH is in his 50s and MIL is in her 70s. She was married to her 4th husband about 5 years ago. I don’t know if I would call him JN but he is also very needy and super annoying, I will call him FIL for simplicity even though he met my husband when DH was in his 40s and is not a father figure (even though MIL insists on DH calling him dad, ugh!). Also about 4 years ago they both had medical issues and DH had to drop his life, including career and family to go be their live in nurse for about a month. At the end of the month MIL hung on to him and begged him not to go back to his life (career, kids, wife) and stay and take care of them. I can’t even wrap my head around all that is wrong there. They don’t take care of themselves and enable FIL’s grown kids by paying for anything they want. Now they are running out of retirement and licking their lips at our bank account. (a whole other JN story)

Current situation:

On Saturday MIL kept making comments about a dream trip my husband and I are taking in July. She has known about this trip, it is our honeymoon because we didn’t get one when we were married. We have paid thousands of dollars into this trip, nonrefundable. She said things about she hoped my health didn’t get in the way (I was very sick about 2 months ago) and I was so busy this summer, how was I going to have time. She said she would be so mad if we didn’t get to go on this trip. I thought these comments were odd but I couldn’t put my finger on why she was harping on it. This visit was about 4 or so hours so this was over the course of hours and between other conversation so I couldn’t connect the dots. She said something else, FIL may need surgery again soon. The same kind my DH had to go spend a month taking care of him 4 years ago. It finally clicked; she is trying to set DH up to come back and take care of him!

Guys I may be paranoid but with the way she schemes, this makes since to me. My DH had to do this 4 years ago and play nurse with a guy he barely knew. The kicker is FIL has 3 kids. 1 that lives in the same city and is a home health aide, 1 that is a nurse, and 1 that has no job! FIL gives the one without a job $500 a month so he can pay bills for his family, paid for the nurse to go on vacation to far away country, and gives the other money constantly for any and everything. I think it is time they step up and take care of their dad.

They come to us because we are responsible but that isn’t fair. We have lives and now she is plotting to ruin our vacation. My brain is scrambled, please any advice on what to say or how to approach her if she asks him to stay over there? Anybody seeing around this corner better than I can and know what her game is? Why us? There is so much more I have dealt with but this I can’t shake. My DH has a hard time saying no to his mom (has a soft spot) but he is in total agreement with me that this is unacceptable.",JUSTNOMIL
"`I feel like I have this handled, but I'm always open to constructive advice.` 

I know I just posted yesterday, but the first half of my title is the question my therapist asked me today regarding Mother and it has me a little dumbfounded. I've found that posting here is a great way for me to process as well as providing a record of things and a wonderful sounding board with the responses I get from y'all. 

He told me that the first step in setting boundaries is determining values, like what in the relationship with Mother is valuable to DH and I and what are things that violate our values/we can't tolerate. He told me healthy boundaries allow in the good but block/redirect the bad and, with a firm hand and some luck, can train a boundary-stomping adult like a toddler or a dog to behave in the future (isn't that always the dream??). 

He didn't say this, but I assume that if there is nothing valuable or good in the relationship, then the obvious boundaries would be blocking the toxicity entirely with nothing to preserve, i.e., No Contact.  

I don't want to go No Contact (at least not yet, without trying some training first), but I'm having a really hard time giving exact names to positive values I get from my current relationship with my Mother. I mean, there's the obvious of keeping nice with her making relationships with my Dad and siblings easier, but I can't think of what specifically I get out of just my relationship with her. 

Generally, I can say I love Mother and even tend to enjoy her company in small doses, but right now I've got so much bitterness the BEC effect is really strong and potentially clouding out the good things I *know* have existed in our relationship before this past year. I'm going to keep thinking about it and talking with DH and YS to process, but it's revealing that nothing comes to mind.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Today's therapy appointment was also incredibly well-timed as Mother and one of my older brothers (OB2) are making a cross country drive back to Hometown today from Other State where they went for Extended Family Event and messaged me an hour before my appointment asking to stop by later this evening for a few minutes on their way back. I would love to see OB2, as it's been a long time and he's great, but I'm apprehensive about having Mother in my house, especially late in the evening, given how it went last time she stopped by for a ""short visit"" while traveling (See my old post ""Mother is at it again"" for details).  

My therapist gave me some great advice on controlling the situation, and I'm *contingently* letting them stop by, but they already know if they get delayed and want to stop by later than the currently agreed upon time, we will no longer be available. We have also already agreed (we as in Mother, OB2, YS, and DH) that it WILL be a short visit. If Mother delays leaving, I will tell her (at the encouragement of my therapist) that I am getting ready for bed and to see herself out (or to quietly continue on with YS who stays up much later, I don't feel like I can dictate their ability to visit with each other since YS lives here too). 

I am psyching myself up to calmly and firmly enforce boundaries **in the moment** rather than as a follow-up text after the visit where I passively allow boundary stomping to happen while getting hurt and frustrated. 

In general, Mother has been doing a lot better (started her own therapy, unprompted by me) so I'm hoping it'll go smoothly in the 15-20 minutes they're here without me needing to put my foot down on anything, but I'm prepared to do so.",JUSTNOMIL

"The first couple times I met her, she was fine and polite towards me. I have been with her son for over 2 years now, living together for about a year and a half. I own the home we share, and a lot of our free time is spent updating the place or projects together. We are happy and are planning to wed soon most likely in private. My bf and I live on the east coast, his mother lives on the west coast. We see eachother a handful of times a year.

His mother really has no interest in having a relationship with me and that bothers me. Last summer when she came to visit, she banned me from being at our house because she wanted alone time with just her son. My bf and I both had an issue with this, and when my bf expressed his disapproval in tears, she didnt seem to care. I work 9-5, so I was confused as to why they couldnt have alone time then. Whenever she calls she doesnt ask about me, our plans together, or even acknowledge me. She basically pretends I dont exist in her sons life.

This hurts both of us because our day to day lives revolve around eachother.

Each time I'm around her, she greets my bf with a bear hug, nearly crying, and then me with a fake half hug/shoulder pat. Then she brags about other female colleages of my bf becoming doctors or continuing education, the gossip, etc. She makes me feel insignificant or that I'm not good enough for her son. I asked her if she had any idea what my job was, and she said ""uh no not really"". I offered that I work in brain surgery and she told me ""ok"" and was pretty disinterested. For someone that knows everything about everyone else, I thought it was her way of dismissing me. 

 It was hard to make eye contact with her the remainder of the trip. She would also get my bf alone to make plans, it left me feeling uncertain if I was invited or not. It's also inconsiderate to not include me in planning because it's my trip /life too. 

On valentines, she dominated my bf 's time the entire day. She last minute made my bf go to her drs appointment which left me at the house by myself all day. Then afterwards she decided to celebrate his birthday early. It ruined all plans my bf and I had for valentine's day. She could have just waited for his birthday a couple days later but didnt. I feel sidelined and question if she is oddly jealous of how involved with her son I am.

 She crops me out of any pictures. She made a scrap book about my bf's life and I was nowhere in it. She has access to my bfs bank account and Roth IRA. Apparently she monitors it frequently. She wont be my friend on social media because she doesnt want any of her sons ""friend's"" on there. She emails my bf misc things about not sharing password info because girls could potentially sabotage his success, or other warnings. I dont have his passwords but he showed these emails once. She sends updates about my bfs life in chain emails to friends and family. She doesnt include me or anything he and I are up to. Mainly goes into huge detail about his work or guitar hobby.  There's a lot more examples I could write but this is already getting long.

I think in her mind I dont even exist. I've never treated her son poorly, we have a happy, serious, and committed relationship together. This stuff really bothers my bf and despite him talking to her about it, she refuses to acknowledge our relationship. I have never tried to talk with her about my concerns and I try not to say much to my bf about this. My bf feels like it's useless to talk to her about this and that in the past she has been like this towards any girl he's been with. I'm the first girl he has lived with and planned a future with.

I want the relationship between us to be better.

 My family lives in the midwest, loves my bf, asks about him almost daily, joint video chats, invites him on family trips, sends him birthday gifts,  Christmas gifts, etc. This complete opposite relationship between our families is so sad to me. On the contrary, my bfs father and other family really like me, and absolutely notice her behavior.



How do I cope or accept this? Should I reach out to her at some point? Tolerating her behavior would mean to me that I dont value myself. I deserve to have healthy relationships with the females in my life 


Tl;dr: My (25f) controlling FMIL (60's) doesn't accept me in her son's (25m) life and it hurts.",JUSTNOMIL
So as some of you may know she has a sharp uncaring tongue that I’ve let slide so many times but this is too much. I cut her and the rest for the family out when I couldn’t take the constant belittling and mind games. I fought to get my life up and running after leaving my abusive ex as stated in previous posts. To get me to talk to her again a year ago she tells my brother she has leukemia. I came running believing every word of it. Come to find out no-one else knew about it. She was apparently fine and didn’t even have an oncologist...ok let that go with the whole stubborn old lady thing thinking maybe she didn’t want to let everybody know and maybe didn’t want to deal with chemo. After Friday’s cold words I didn’t call all weekend. Monday she calls to tell me my Grandfather has a major infection and might not make it. Today she says that his heart stopped and they had to shock him back. Well here’s where things get sticky. My mother lives with them and texts me regularly. When I asked if she knew if he’d be coming home from the hospital she’s says he’s not in the hospital. Ok did he come home already? ...What are you talking about? He’s eating steak at the table and has been in the garden all day...What?!? Dose he have an infection? ...Nope! Healthy as always...This is too much... I mean what am I supposed to do? Not care if he’s in the hospital because I won’t know if it’s a lie?!? Someone please tell me I’m not the 🐝 with an itch here!,JUSTNOMIL
"I am newly married, 8 months in. Currently live with JYFIL, he keeps to himself and lets us have the house, which we partially share with DH’s twin. Twin is moving away for school in 2 months, and is our closest friend, so no issues there. Due to being young/thrifty/DH’s school, we are not in a position to move to our own place, nor do we want to. We live on a spacious piece of farmland, with lots of room for me to grow a garden and raise my (((many))) pets (and future babies).  Want lots of kids right away and that isn’t a problem either, supportive family and lots of experience in childcare so I’m confident in our future plans. Only downside to an otherwise idyllic situation is that MIL lives down the street, a 2 minute drive or 5 minute walk away, at husband #4’s house. She... is a piece of work. I am really good at handling her, and I believe she considers me a close friend. But damn... is this lady a basket case. For brevity’s sake, I’ll start with our engagement and wedding.
1) Despite divorcing FIL raw when her children were 4 &amp; 5, three months after he bought her a house, essentially trying to get half the house and secure her future, she complained to me that her last name didn’t match FIL’s on the invites, and people could tell they were divorced. She expressed her distress that my parents were still together and people would know. Fucking of course they know, it happened!
2) During the wedding planning, she asked me what ‘era’ she should go for aesthetically with her dress, which I reacted to like a grey rock, trying to head off the inevitable as she tried to steal the spotlight. She decided after my non-commital response on a navy blue 50’s lace dress with a matching hat to ‘match the boys and FIL’. Ignoring how awkward it was for her to openly long for her family she gave up right in front of her newest husband.
3) Literally the week of my wedding, which I DIY’d most of to save money, she approached me, asking for something to do while I was extremely busy and stressed, essentially threatening to throw a nervous breakdown if she wasn’t busy helping. In the middle of important final wedding details, I had to take a brisk hour slapping together a graphic design for an invite to the rehearsal dinner- which the attendees were already aware of and in the loop - so she would fuck off with an activity to distract her.
4) she spent months before the wedding stressing and trying to back out of the mother-son dance. It was ‘hey soul sister’ by train. They had to boogie together for a quick few seconds, and she fretted and cried to me that 3 1/2 minutes was too long and she couldn’t stand people looking at her the whole time. I know for a fact she was loaded to the hilt and had a few Xanax before the event. It showed.
5) she had the gall to compare her first wedding to FIL- proposed to on cocaine after 6 months, not approved of by her family, 90’s puff princess sleeves, elk lodge heads and decor, not to mention ending in total nuclear fallout where they hated and didn’t talk to each other for a decade- to mine, getting hurt and making snide comments wherever my plans diverged from hers. Sorry we don’t want to emulate your shitty example.

I’m very worried about boundary issues when I have a child.  I know I sound like a bitch but I do have sympathy for the bad events in her life that shaped her behavior. But if at 23 I’m a grown ass woman, she sure as fuck should be an adult. According to DH, she once had him take a bath with a neighbor girl when they were both nine years old. This, and some sexually abusive stuff I know she suffered from as a child, leads me to believe she may have some wrong beliefs about what is appropriate to express around children.  I already feel really uncomfortable with the way she expresses love to her own sons, it seems to verge on the inappropriate quite frequently. For this reason, I will not leave her alone with my babies. For any reason. Or length of time. At the VERY least until they are 8-11 and I have instilled a strong instinct to stick up for themselves and know how to say no when they are uncomfortable.
Worse, she had a ‘mean’ mom and often talks about what a great mother she was, literally bragging about being a present caretaker-for the first seven years. Because you know, children only need their mothers for the formative years, anything after 7 is superfluous. She also counts it as a credit that she can be friends with her 25yo sons. She’s friends with her sons because she is willing to watch her sons smoke, drink, and not object. She thinks this is an improvement in her own mom’s parenting style. Meaning she comes over and complains that her mom doesn’t want her to smoke weed in front of her face. She is 50, her mother is 80.
I haven’t had to reign her in too much since the wedding. But telling her I’m pregnant, I know she will try to give me advice/steamroll me/take over the spotlight of my first pregnancy like she loves to do. And I need advice on how to not tongue-lash her death. It’s easy enough mentioning her “meth as weight loss” phase and her “you’re a shit mom” facts, but she’s convinced she is an amazing mom because her sons don’t hate her. She expects to be a babysitter when our baby is born. Lol.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hey, this is my first post on reddit about my JNM, when I’ve put my childhood in a little bit more perspective I might post about her as well. But my post is about getting my Stepdad who I love dearly  into the mindset of thinking that the way the C*nt I came from (my mother) treated both of us was abusive when a large part of her abuse was about making me feel insane and out of my mind by changing her recall of arguments from what I remember to what makes her the victim.

"My mom texted me. 

&amp;gt;BG figured out you blocked her on facebook

&amp;gt;she wanted to tell you happy birthday 

&amp;gt;can I give you her phone number? 

&amp;gt;nevermind. You don’t want her drama 

Oh, but I kinda do. And in addition, now that BG knows my mom would/is/could withhold my contact info—if I said, “No, don’t share my info,” then that’s me sacrificing the scapegoat, so to speak. 

What do you do when you went no contact without explanation—no big falling out, just trying to avoid that ‘death by a thousand cuts’—and they contact you and ask you why? 

I figured I’d say, “Beej, I didn’t want to be in contact with you because of the way you treat my mom.” I know that’s JADEing but also, I’m not going to lie. Her feelings are already hurt, and she’s not stupid enough to buy something like, “Oh! Facebook must have had a glitch!” And even if she WERE, that would mean undoing my no contact in favor of watching more of her abuse of my mom. So sorry. No more. 

How do you navigate something like this? You say, “You treat your scapegoat like shit, and that’s why I don’t want to be in contact with you,” and then they hear it as, “If only it weren’t for your scapegoat, you could control our relationship like you want!”

**UPDATE:** Lmao she’s not gonna call. My mom sent screenshots of her texts. She’s doing the “woe is me, she doesn’t want to be my friend much less my granddaughter, *I* am not going to chase after anyone!!” BS. I knew she would chicken out. I guess I’ll change the flair now to be something less dramatic. I’d still like advice on the off chance (&lt;1%) that she does call.",JUSTNOMIL
So my mom called today with some pretty important medical news. After taking to her for half an hour the subject turned to my pregnancy she said she had some questions and wanted to clarify boundaries! I was all about it yes please let’s talk like grown ups and say what needs to be said. She asks about 10 questions all of which I answered and we moved on it all seemed like to good to be true and it was. She brought up being at the hospital during delivery again. I repeated we didn’t want anyone there again. She starts sobbing and screaming about what she did wrong and how DH and I are so meannn to herrrr!!! She just wants to be with her babyyyyy!!! My husband listened to me try to talk her down for 20 minutes as I myself was on the verge of a panic attack when he took the phone. He told her she’s not welcome and we arnt having anyone there it’s not up for negotiation and I’ve already given her an answer and we won’t be talking about it again. Y’all this is the first time he has ever disagreed with my mother and she. flipped. Her. Shit. She started screaming that if we didn’t want her around she wouldn’t be around. Called my husband a “fucking asshole” and hung up. After sobbing for another 15 minutes I went and took a bubble bath and tried to pretend my own mother isn’t the one factor tarnishing my new pregnancy. Rant over.,JUSTNOMIL
"LtL, first time poster. I just needed to vent a bit.

My D(ear) husband and I met when I was thirteen and he seventeen. We started dating after he got me out of a shitty relationship my senior year and have been together ever since. Once I turned eighteen, I moved in with him, my JNMIL, my JNGFIL, and my JNGMIL.

My JNGP are incredibly racist and homophobic. In fact JNGMIL tried to prevent me from moving in when she learned I'm Hispanic/Native American. Thankfully his mother saw reason and I moved in on the 12th of September anywaus., but boy is she a pain. Complains when I work, when I don't, when I sleep all day to work at night, claiming I'm a ""princess"" because DH does most of the work since I'm disabled. It never ended.

My JNMIL was probably worse about things after a while. Long story short she kicked us out believing we stole $1,500 from her. Well, she kicked me out and said DH could stay. Thankfully he has a shiny spine and told her he was leaving and she couldn't stop him. Of course this was my fault, so she started throwing my stuff out of the house. Even broke my keyboard.

We didn't talk to her for a while... Until she found out I was transgender. She threw a major fit, telling DH he had to ""divorce me and marry a real woman"". He shot her down very fast thankfully and I've been VVVVVLC ever since. She forced us out to see his grandmother, then his grandmother forced us out to Mother's Day brunch and she just wouldn't let up. Disrespecting me, arguing with me.

She's a very stubborn woman and has tried everything she can to get DH to come home. She claimed I was sleeping around with another man, believed rumors about me and used those to try and get him to divorce me. She's insane. All because she doesn't like me, the fact I'm bi, or the fact I'm trans",JUSTNOMIL
"TLDR; my MIL’s relationship with DH is slowly taking over my marriage. I feel like MIL comes first and I come second in our relationship. DH doesn’t see anything wrong, and I’m afraid he is asking her to be too involved raising our child. 

Long time lurker from other accounts, first time poster and needed to vent. I think my DH and MIL have a somewhat unhealthy relationship. 

DH has fulfilled some emotional support roles for MIL since her and FIL got divorced when he was young. When we first started dating he moved back home to take care of her after she was suffering from insomnia following a routine surgery, and we did long distance for a year. 

We’re married now, and it has really started to bother me how overbearing she is. MIL will call DH’s phone several times in a row and leave frantic voicemails, then call my phone and leave urgent voicemails to have him call her. This is every few weeks. DH talked to her once about it because it sounds like an emergency but never is, and she got better but then picked it up again. 

She constantly lays on the guilt with him about coming home or seeing him every weekend or every other week (someone’s birthday, holiday, etc). We go down and visit almost every other weekend, and she comes up to our house a few times a month.

Their physical relationship sometimes creeps me out. They are a very affectionate family, but she will give him back rubs and massages, or hang on him with her arms around him in a casual but extended hug. 

We did a couples costume for Halloween at a family party, and she showed up as a character from the book unbeknownst to me that we were going as a group of three. I’ve tried to bring up that I feel like his mother always comes first in our relationship, but DH thinks I’m overreacting. He also says he feels guilty because she is lonely and he owes it to her to be there.

We made plans to drive out west to visit his cousin, and MIL informed me she was going too and we would all drive in her car. DH said, “oh yeah, I meant to talk to you about that.” 

A huge fight ensued, lots of yelling by both of us. I’ve made similar complaints about decisions being made for me or behind my back between DH and MIL. DH says the decision wasn’t made for this trip, and he just never got the chance to talk to me. He says he can’t control what MIL says, and I had no right to be mad. So, I had to apologize.

I just found out I’m pregnant, and he is already talking about her moving in with us for a few weeks/months right after the baby is born. For “support”. He even wants her at the hospital when I deliver. He wants to tell her our news before I’m ready to announce. DH said it was his news to share too, and he didn’t care when I said it was okay because he wants to tell his mom. But she can’t keep a secret and I don’t want everyone to know until I’m comfortable in case there is a loss.

Help! Am I overreacting and totally nuts?",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi there! Very classic, long time lurkery afoot, etc. This might be on the longer side too. For reference I'm a (partially closeted) genderfluid 18yr old (they/them pretty please!). I love my mum, but I don't love how she behaves. And it's getting worse again. I have two sides to this; realistically I know that she's being at least semi-emotionally abusive- but when she doesn't see it as anything wrong, it's hard to think of it as it is. There's also some financial controlling, and believe it or not she's currently controlling how much therapy I can get. But all of that's for a different time.  

The problem is her 'mum-talks'. They've been getting more recent again; and there was an incident with my BF that frankly scared me. Basically a 'mum-talk' is her deciding when to bring something, or a lot of things up no matter my emotional state; it's a lot of gas-lighting, a lot of manipulation and put-downs. This can be about literally anything. A lot of its about her boyfriend (which is honestly why I think she's getting worse again- that's a different story). If she thinks it's bad enough, she's ""onto me"" (her words). 

The problems with the mum-talks, besides the obvious, is that if I'm emotional, it's a huge sign I'm in the wrong- and if I'm not emotional and I'm disassociating (main coping mechanism) I'm shutting her out and being a terrible child.  Then she has a meltdown, screams at me that she's giving up as a parent; leaves, comes back, screams more etc. She also purposefully says things she knows trigger me, which doesn't help with the being emotional or disassociating thing. 

She's never done this with anyone else around. Sure, my sister's heard it- but she sides with my mum. It's the family dynamic, I know that and I can't change it. Not for a lack of trying, either.

But she did it with my boyfriend the other day, and honestly I saw it as an escalation. It wasn't a particularly bad one, sure- but he left shaken, and worried about me, and since then it's been a battle to have her keep anything to herself. I'm living at home with no way out yet, and I can't escape these talks, so it's clear to me that I need to gray-rock, but I don't know how without her... Doing what she does. I need some help, please, guys. I really appreciate it.",JUSTNOMIL

"You know how the Twilight Zone episodes began eerie &amp; unsettling, but you couldn't put your finger on what was going on? You just had to wait &amp; let the story unfold.

[That's how this ongoing saga of dysfunction feels](https://youtu.be/NzlG28B-R8Y).

As you might recall from Episode III, on Mother's Day MIL texted me happy wishes for the day, she *does* love me. There was more to the text that I didn't get into, about how she knows how hard it is for me with my mom's health (it is poor this is true) &amp; living so far from my mom, and if I ever need MIL, she wants to be there for me. She lives even further away from my mom &amp; they don't have a relationship, so probably this means staying w/DH, OS &amp; YS when I visit my fam. I replied thanks, if you can help I will let you know. I texted things have been steadier lately. Yep I'd been giving MIL too much info about my mom's ups &amp; downs in the past, but not anymore. Hello info diet.

I've told MIL before how grateful I am to be geographically closer to my fam, a half-day's drive. In the twenty years of DH's military service we were never this close. So MIL isn't really making sense until I put on my super-duper JustNo decoder ring. Guys could this be a swipe at my weakest spot? My gut says this is emotional manipulation of some kind. Especially bc right before MIL texted this, she is on the phone with DH asking if Done Lady is ever going to speak to her again. She has made no attempt to contact me since Mother's Day. Kinda weird for someone who is concerned about our relationship, innit?

The limited convo or two between MIL &amp; DH since then have been light topics and cheerful tones. On Memorial Day DH calls her but she has to cut the convo off bc she is trying to get somewhere. She says she'll call back later. She doesn't. In the land of normal this would be fine, but this is the twilight zone for MIL. Memorial Day is a Really Big Deal on multiple levels. SFIL is retired military too, and all of us have experienced military service related loss. 

But okay. Not taking the bait. The quiet has been what we needed.

Then OS remembers during our half-day drive to my FOO yesterday that MIL texted him over Memorial Day weekend. It's a weird, long, formally written message. Almost resume cover letter-esque. About how she wants to learn even more about the Big Day he had already dutifully hammered out an email to her about a month ago. About how she is interested in him. About how she was going to post on FB about the Big Day. She asked a clarification question about it. She even typed out her phone number (she knows how to text, she knows this isn't necessary). She says she'd love a phone call.

OS being in the middle of whatever a 17 yo is in the middle of, he texts the answer to her question 3 minutes later, but does not call right away. Immediately she texts how she was really hoping for a phone call, sadface. OS tells me it made him feel first guilty &amp; then mad enough to ignore her. Which he did. Then he forgot.

It's like a game of chicken right now. It feels stupid and pointless. But we've worked really hard to resist the pull of obligation &amp; guilt since our last visit w them St. Patrick's Day weekend. It seems like a mistake to start smoothing things over. It feels wrong to start filling in the weird gaps in communication with the kind of normalcy we usually bring to the table. What do you guys think? I've dropped the rope, but should DH &amp; OS play this game of silent chicken? Or should they just call her &amp; say, what's up doc?

I saved the best news for last: DH has been reading &amp; journaling, and it took a month but he says he's ready to find a therapist. This is a big step and I am super stoked. Thanks once again for all the support.",JUSTNOMIL
"Mostly just ranting, but feel free to give advice.

So I've posted a little but my MIL is the one who got way too involved post my baby's rough birth (we are all fine now) and talked to my care team. She also brings up her will and quizzes us on the preparations she's made for her death.

So my husband's cousin was in town for the holiday weekend and as we were chatting it was obvious that she knew quite a bit about my birth experience. This is not a cousin we are close with, we have seen her 3 times in the 10+ years we have been together. 

I start gently probing and it comes out in conversation that after DH told his mom to back off and I got my medical information locked down, she went and talked about my issues to this cousin's brother b/c he is an OBGYN. I guess she couldn't handle being shut out of my vagina and wanted to get some insight? Idfk. 

But Im so fucking angry. Everytime I think I might be able to calm down and move on, some shit like this happens. 

AND she's been texting my dad, who has no idea there's any drama going on (dad has quite a few medical issues and I choose to put on a happy front where my parents are concerned. I basically have them on an info diet so it's not like they share anything with her anyhow).

Just leave me alone! Its so hard to justify my anger when she throws out absolutley no malice. All love bombs. No one else sees it except my DH. He's the only one who talks to her now. I don't respond to anything she sends me (shes on silent), I have blocked her on all social media. And she only visits when I go on travel bc we use the guise of ""oh DH will need help with the baby while Calamity is gone"" so I never have to see her (pls note she is only actually evwr ""alone"" with baby when my husband is like pooping or something). And she doesn't stay in my home bc she has the tendency to re arrange my kitchen or clean or add in her old ass decorations from her own house that she claims are ""so special"" or some shit.

"Ok long post.. Throw away because well ya know... on mobile so if format is messed up sorry 🤷‍♀️.

Little about me: F/37 my mother kicked me out when I was 13 haven't spoken to her since, so I don't really have a firm grasp on what an adult child and mother relationship should look like. 

So my MIL we shall call her the silent punisher, I am married to her daughter (obvs) and for the first 3 years MIL was tolerable. Let me preface by saying MIL had complete control over my SO, MIL had to be on her bank account so that MIL could monitor what SO spends, if SO wanted to treat herself and get starbucks with the money she earned she had to ask MIL permission first, MIL reasoning was ""I pay for your car insurance"" so SO let it slide. Small things along those lines that irked me but I could deal. 

Mil has a tendency to make SO feel like everything wrong in MIL's life is SO fault which makes me mad. Mil manipulates my SO to the point where all my SO says is I'm sorry over and over when she has done nothing wrong.

NOW TRIGGER WARNING****


SO has a 14yo brother, weird kid, has no friends, has anger issues, spends all day screaming at his xbox.
SO changed jobs and only got part time, so SO convinced me to let MIL, FIL and BIL to move in to help with mortage, I reluctantly agreed... So they moved in SO had to leave the state for work training a week later, that day SO left I found out BIL has been molesting my 7yo, screaming match, strong murder urges tabled all three of them thrown out of my house. Cops called reports filed ECT ECT,  well SO can't leave training so it's another week before she returns home, MIL calling her crying all the time saying she is sorry and now's the time to show me what a family is and how we should all stick together, are you freaking kidding me? This goes on for a few days and SO tells MIL that we need time to heal and go from there, MIL spouts off crap like ""at least I told her I could of just kept my mouth shut"" (MIL caught him in the act then told me). He goes to court cause he was a minor I wasn't allowed to go, found out about 3 months after he went to court that he has court ordered therapy and is not allowed in the same room as my child.
I have stopped talking to MIL at this point cause she has never given this kid consequences for his actions, in fact she sent him on a school band trip a few weeks after his court date to Washington DC for 4 days then 2 months after that they went to Canada for a 2 week vacation. 
So yeah I was done with MIL, SO loves her mom and wants to be on hood ground with her. 
We decided to sell our house and move next state over and live with FIL for a few months while we get back on our feet, here comes the weekly crying and screaming phone calls ""you are abandoning your family"" ""your choosing her over your family""... ECT ECT you get the point.

Now SO feels like I'm making her cut her mom out of her life because I want nothing to do with the woman, SO said to me ""I can't go down there and visit her without you, you know I wouldn't do that"" and that by cutting myself and my child off from MIL means she can't go see MIL... I have told her repeatedly that she can go see her mom whenever she wants that I don't mind, but she refuses to without me. I won't back down because I need to protect my child period. 

I guess I'm just looking for validation that I'm making the right choices and SO needs to make her own rules and boundaries with MIL and leave me out of it.

(This involves both MIL and FIL, but MIL is the one spearheading this whole debacle as she's the one who is half decent at English. Just kick my ass if this breaks the rules or whatever.) 

For some context of the family situation, I'm a white male, but my wife is Pakistani and Muslim (not in faith, but it's how she was raised.) I genuinely know nothing of their culture/beliefs/whatever, as my wife is not really involved in any of it, and I'm a dumb American. On top of that, my 3 year old daughter is actually my step daughter. I met my wife when she was 3 months pregnant, we started dating around 8 months. Bio dad is deceased. I'm the only dad my daughter has ever known, and I'm currently in the process of adopting her. My in laws have lots of opinions on this situation. Most of their actions have been JustUghMIL, and it's never really bothered me, beyond the initial ""can you fucking not"". I guess today they decided to switch on their ""batshit insane"" switch though!

Wife is out of town. It's the first time she's been out of town since daughter was born, but we've been handling it well. I travel for work quite a bit though, so daughter has some experience with the routine. One thing that's part of this routine is sharing the bed with her mom when I'm not there. So she wanted to share the bed with me. I'm totally ok with that, although I had never done it before. Anytime she wants to share the bed when I'm here, I go to the guest room as they hoard the bed and squirm. Wife and I never discussed if it would still be appropriate to sleep in my normal attire (boxers with no shirt). I assumed it would be, as daughter has seen me shirtless countless times. I still don't know wife's stance on the matter, but I'm fully planning on fighting her if she says it isn't appropriate. 

The past two nights daughter and I have been sharing a bed, me in boxers and daughter in normal pajamas. This morning, MIL and FIL decided to stop by to take daughter out for the day. Wife has given them a key and a ""barge into our home anytime"" policy, so they didn't wake us when entering. When daughter wasn't in her room, they decided to walk right on in to my room. They were greeted with the sight of me and my daughter asleep in my bed. Apparently this is on par with seeing me beating someone, as they started screeching and yelling in a mix of English and their language. I woke up, daughter started flipping out, so I just lifted her out of bed and carried her to her room. I then told them that if they didn't leave that minute I would call the police. They left and called my wife, apparently telling her they had caught me in the act, so to speak. Wife spoke to daughter, then me, hung up and went to yell at MIL, I guess. Daughter seems to think it was all a dream. We got dressed, went out for breakfast, and now we're home with a locksmith who is rekeying the locks. I've already decided that they will not be getting a key, and all future visits with wife or daughter will be scheduled. Wife, in the past, has taken my side on most debacles, and I'm fairly certain she can at least sympathize with my point here even if she's on their team now (which I doubt.)

So! What the fuck comes after this. Was I in the wrong? Is sleeping in boxers next to your fully clothed daughter weird? Is there any natural progression from ""accusing son in law of raping his daughter""?",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi All,

So I’m fairly new to Reddit and I read posts about everyone’s MIL. I don’t know whether it’s me taking it personally or whether it’s just aimed at us both (My fiancée and I). I just feel his family doesn’t like me or us for that fact. 

Some background info - He is 22 and I am 21 we have been together coming up to 4 years. We have been engaged for 6 months. Without being too soppy he is the love of my life...most days haha! Just kidding I love him very much but he has his moments like I do. 

Every since we got together I never got the ‘welcome to my home’ feeling. I would wait outside in my car until my partner came home before going into the house and we pretty much would always go straight to his room. We would say Hi and that was it. 

Our first Christmas came around, albeit we had been together 3 months or so and I get it’s a family thing but she didn’t want me round on Christmas Day but I could come round on Boxing Day but I wasn’t allowed to stay round. Pointless if I enjoyed to drink so I checked with my parents and they were happy for him to stay round. We spent Christmas as my parents and I tried my hardest to make sure he was involved in all our festivities (my mum still does Santa sacks even though her eldest son is 30 next year). His mum had not bothered to message him a merry Christmas or anything of the sort. My mum encouraged him to phone her and wish her a good Christmas. He went upstairs into my room to do this and I came up a few minutes later to check on him and he was crying. His mum has been up for hours and couldn’t even be bothered to message him. 

I was allocated certain days to stay round I.e Sunday-Wednesday but only once a week. I was never invited round for dinner but then again my partner was never allowed to have dinner with them unless he supplied his own food. So we would just cook our own dinner together. Before my fiancée and I moved out, she was trying to pressure us to rent a place. He knew already I didn’t want to do this and I wanted to buy a place. He did tell his mum this. Luckily for us we moved into our first place almost 2 years ago, but it almost felt like she didn’t want him there nor did she want me there.


The MIL got upset with us as I had invited my parents to celebrate his 21st last year but I didn’t invite his parents to my 21st. If she had ever asked I would of explained that as she didn’t want to take annual leave for one night to celebrate her sons 21st, I wanted him to feel loved by people he knew, we had my parents and my brother there along with some of his friends. We also did a dinner a couple of days earlier with his family on a day they could see him on to celebrate his birthday. Again for my birthday it was on my actual 21st with my parents, my brother, an auntie and an uncle and some of my friends. My 21st fell on the same day as his a year later a Monday so I knew if she didn’t take time off for her own son she isn’t going to take time off for me. 

She is also very petty with us. For example last summer my partner texted her saying ‘what time are you having the bbq?’. He knew she would be having a bbq because it was a nice day out and he joked with me about it. She quickly rung him to say ‘oh we haven’t got enough food for you and your girlfriend to come round’. He wasn’t bothered as he knew that would be her response. I mentioned it to my mum as I was kinda confused as to how you could have a bbq with the rest of the family but leave one child out? 

She has already made it quite clear she wants us to live our life before we have children and that she will not be grandmother that will babysit. For me everything she does and says just builds up to the point that I can not be bothered to make effort with her anymore but I know my partner will get upset with me because it’s his mum at the end of the day.

I don’t know how to approach the situation or her? It’s gotten to the point where she wants to meet my family to get to know them before the wedding but my dad is almost refusing because he doesn’t want to embarrass me by saying something nasty to her.

Some advice from you guys would be great :)",JUSTNOMIL
"That’s it, that’s the post.

I guess she thinks it’s her baby too.

My husband told her absolutely not, she’s crazy. And to never ask that again.

She then asked if she could do it at home, if not at the hospital. I’m shaking. What makes her think that’s appropriate? I’m so upset. Why doesn’t she understand boundaries?

Not her baby. I want to just put a strict ban on ever letting her near the baby when there’s not another adult present. That’s sick. I’m disgusted.",JUSTNOMIL
"I don’t know how to flair this and please excuse mobile typos. 

So, it happened. We’re pregnant! I am 15 weeks plus some days. Woohoo! And the MIL shenanigans have already begun! It’s a whole lot of BEC and not entirely justno BUT we’re just getting started. 

We announced it to her on Mother’s Day and there was zero screaming/jumping/excitement or any kind of joy coming from her at the news she is going to be a grandma. We wrapped a onesie as a gift and as she unwrapped it she assumed it was an article of clothing and held it up loudly exclaiming “OOHHHHHHH-(tapering down to)hhhhhhhhh....” trailing off once she realized what it was. She then dropped her arms straight down and balled up the onesie saying a lot of “oh fuck you guys! I knew it! Fuck you, I fucking knew it!” She said “fuck you” about 10 times. I secretly recorded her reaction and several friends described her tone as *angry disappointment.* Like when your mom tells you she’s not upset with you but you know she’s actually furious. 

We told her she was the first one to know about the baby because we eloped 2 years ago and we didn’t tell her until later on, about a month afterwards. My awesome mom knew about us eloping as it happened. MIL held that over our heads forever and still does. Why do you think we eloped in the first place??? So we told MIL we kept the baby secret and made sure no one else knew until she knew, and she thanked me for that.......but at least 10 people on my side knew about the baby before she did. My mom knew 10 minutes after I peed on the stick at 5 weeks. We didn’t tell MIL until 13 weeks. Haaaaaaaa. 

She then repeatedly asked me if it was ok to post an announcement on social media about the baby. I told her that would be fine AFTER we told DHs brothers. This is the first baby on DHs side so we’re making the ILs grandparents and BILs uncles for the first time, it’s kinda special. She then immediately posts it on IG and when I complained about wishing we’d told the BILs before making it public so they don’t find out via social media she said “oh, fuck em!” And then quickly sends a group text (that DH and I weren’t even included on...) to BILs saying “surprise uncles!” with our ultrasound photo. 

The morning after, she gave me side eye while I was making a cup of coffee and said “Now, are you supposed to be drinking that?” (I have one cup in the morning, ok’d by my doctor) and then she told me to make sure I exercise and avoid smoking and alcohol (duh...?) because she’s freaked out about her grand baby. Like *I’m* not freaked out about *my* baby?? But then she told me she drank wine and swam in the filthy delta while she was pregnant and her boys turned out fine.....Ok, whatever, lady lol 

She also noticed on my ultrasound that it still said my maiden name and I explained I hadn’t legally changed my name yet. Immediately she started referring to the baby as “Baby (DH’s Lastname)” both in person and text/social media.  Yeahhhhhh, she really is that much of a bitch. 

MIL didn’t contact us for about a week after we told her, meanwhile my JYmom constantly checked in with me asking how I’m feeling and how we’re doing and if we needed anything (we live 3+ hours away from our families). My mom and sister also gave me a ton of baby stuff while we were down visiting, since they knew way early and went out and bought me a bunch of stuff plus my sister conveniently has hand me downs. I posted about all the things my family gave me and.....

Now, MIL is texting me about a baby shower....I agreed to let her plan it since it’s her first grandchild (this is a mistake, I know) and she said she would be happy to throw me one. She then tells me my family should throw me a *separate shower* (yes! a fucking separate shower!!) for my side of the family and friends.....yeah, no. I’m not taking time off work and traveling my pregnant-peeing-every-20-minutes-ass 3+ hours for TWO baby showers, not happening. So then she tells me she has to “limit the guests then because $$” and refuses to take any of my suggestions for a cheap, laid back, coed, byob bbq at a park and is insisting she have it in her home. Even though their entire deck, which is the whole back yard, is currently completely ripped out....we’ll see how that goes. 

DH and I had bloodwork done and included gender in the results. We found out last week it’s a boy! I told MIL a grandson is on the way and that DH wanted to name him after FIL.....she then suggested an awful, hideous name (a deceased family pet....nope. Not naming my kid after your dead dog.) 

And finally, Mil has decided she wants to be called “gram gram.” MIL group texted me, DH and BILs (we’re included on this group text but not our baby announcement apparently) a story about road trips when the boys were young and how they called old people on the road “gram gram.” She said that’s what she wants to be called “because those people are probably all dead now and I want to carry it on.” Oooooookay....

I’m kind of entertained watching her struggle with being a justno but also trying to stay on the “precious grand-baby incubator’s” good side (me) to make sure she gets her claws in “little baby boy (lastname).” My spine has turned into titanium and any fucks I had left to give her disappeared as soon as I knew I was pregnant. She hasn’t even asked about the delivery room since I’ve been telling her for years no one will be in there except me, DH and my doctors. I’ll update about the baby shower when it happens in Sept!",JUSTNOMIL
"My son has three names (obnoxious I know) he is named after her father example Martin Ben robert. My sons whole life (9 years) we have called him “mart” until he specifically asked to be called Martin. She was furious we added the Robert because it wasn’t in her dads name. Didn’t matter WHY we did it, it was wrong and we were wrong. We made it clear throughout my entire pregnancy we had planned on calling him “mart” but she HATED that and said it was ugly. To our surprise she decided to call him Rob. Now I know it’s his middle name but no. We called him “mart” and asked everyone to. But she won’t. She calls him rob even after he asked her to call him Martin. 

Today she smuggly looked at me and said “ looks like Rob stuck huh?” And I replied “ not really since he hates it and you are the only one who calls him that.” Of course I got the bitch face. Just wait till she finds out every year since he was born I have thrown away the R Christmas ornaments she buys him.",JUSTNOMIL

"Druggie Diva is my addict mom. She has a personality disorder that is treatable, except she refuses treatment, so no one can really help her. 

DD has been upping the tactics to get our address, which on the one hand means she couldn't verify we live here, but on the other there are people we both know that might spill the beans. I'm waffling on asking people to not give it to her, and I've got other people advising a restraining order, but guys I'm tired. Not like, take a nap tired, but soul tired. It's been a crazy year, and my husband and I are wearing down. I have cameras to set up, I just don't have the energy to figure them out. I'm permanently exhausted. Our LO has what seems to be permanent dark circles under her eyes from all this. I cried my eyes out today and a woman working for another county had to help me set up mental healthcare for myself in my own county. And it's all because of DD's relapse. She had been abusing us covertly, which sucked, but her overt abuse after she started using again drove us from our home in fear for our safety, and that kind of fear is hard to shake. 

I know the steps to take, I'm just so tired I can't take them. I need to set up the cameras. I need to get a restraining order, because if it doesn't go through and she tries something that's grounds for a different one. I need to call the detective handling the one case and report the other stuff I remembered and forgot to say. But I'm exhausted.

"Well I thought we were in the clear for our courthouse wedding this fall, the small guest list (6-7 people on each side) was decided, the restaurant chosen, and his family looking at air b&amp;amp;b’s for their trip. No more complaining that we were making it to small, no more bitching about the date, we were good. Until yesterday.... 

My FMIL posted a funny image of an air b&amp;amp;b on a comically named street, Jackass Lane, that they were looking at for the trip. She in passing mentioned she was visiting for the wedding, well apparently the more extended family on his side was never informed that this was taking place and an aunt asked when and we’re the wedding was. Instead of saying oh it a small event with limited space she informs the aunt of the time and place and date of our wedding and says nothing when this aunt says she’ll see is her and her boys can make it. 

Seeing this I told FDH to finally post in his families private Facebook group to let everyone know what the plan was so no one was disappointed when they realized they weren’t welcome at the dinner afterwards, a dinner kind you my parents are paying for and has already reached into the 1000’s in cost. Well his mother was less than pleased to see he posted it and demanded he not tell people they aren’t invited. That’s silly obviously because they’re not. 

Well the real reason for her tantrum about the post was revealed today... his cousin invited herself and was going to surprise him by just showing up. I put my foot down on this and she LOST IT. she’s upset I invited his cousin who I’m friends with and is incredibly kind to me as my personal guest she asked if her boyfriend could come and I said yeah offering to foot his bill to my parents. I did this because they don’t like him, I know what it’s like to not be liked by this family and it sucks so I’m not excluding him but this of course it was an issue because he’s not “family”. 

Anyway they called to let him know that this was the case because he’d been turning down family members left and right. I finally told FDH that we can’t stop them from coming, for them this is also a vacation they’re staying a week and a half to visit the week of the wedding so if they bring more people for that fine as long as everyone is on the same page that the ceremony and dinner is a private event and only. Well this wasn’t okay so if the family on list couldn’t be invited to dinner and fed they wouldn’t eat, this would be fine if it wasn’t a pay per seat kinda meal. So I put my foot down again, if they are just going to sit and act like children then they’re not welcome they’re not going to cost my parents 39.99 a person and not eat. 

Of course DFH tried to talk me into just paying for his cousin to come out of our pocket but I said no and I finally had a heart to heart about how they’re behavior effect me and my family and this seemed to be the eye opener because without another word he called his mom and told him no. His cousin can come for the vacation but our wedding is set and done. 

She LOST it like extra lost it went into her usual what about me and my family. But then she goes on to say that they matter more, and that ever since he moved across the country with me he doesn’t care about them and they always lose (lies they took over my traditional wedding, my Christmas, my New Years) and that if his cousin and whoever else they want
To invite can’t come then no one will be coming. My fiancé is heart broken he’s been in tears for hours and I don’t know what I can do to fix it except cave. And with this I’m done with his family they sucks and their rude and I hate dealing with them so FMIL has been named Manipulative Mandy. Since manipulating her son is all she knows how to do.

**UPDATE** thank you to everyone who took the time to read this. FMIL and their family have decided cousin will come for their vacation and the entire unit will be skipping dinner. Fine by me my family, DFH, and myself will have a wonderful time without them and now this opened up space for me to invite our two best friends who originally we didn’t think we’d have room/funds for. Win win in my book.",JUSTNOMIL
"My (m-30's) MIL can be classified as sometimes JN and sometimes JY. It all depends on which mood she's in on any given day, and those moods switch back and forth with increasing frequency these days. I never know which MIL I'm going to get on any given day, and it certainly keeps me on my toes.

My IL's typically see us, along with our toddler, about once a month, and sometimes slightly less frequently. We live in the state next to theirs, and quite a few hours away, so visits aren't all that common. After about three weeks of no face to face, MIL starts to get weird, and the passive aggressive comments about never seeing our child start to come to the surface, and drama unfolds until she fiiiiiiiiinally gets to see him. 

Last time they visited, MIL was in a particularly crispy mood the entire four days. My poor wife spent more than half the visit attempting to appease and suck up to her mom. Somewhere in the middle of this visit, my wife went out for lunch with FIL, and MIL opted to stay back. During this period of a few hours, MIL decided she was going to get ""one on one time with her grandbaby"". What she didn't account for, and what she always forgets, is that after he eats lunch, he goes down for a two hour nap. So for the next two hours, MIL sulked on the couch, waiting for my child to wake up. Once again, completely oblivious to his routine, she assumed once he woke, it would be time for playtime with grandma. Wrong again, MIL. He has a routine, and we don't deviate from it so MIL can get her grandma fix. He has his afternoon snack, and then he wants to go and play outside. Cue massive CBF and near emotional meltdown. I feel a bit bad for her, so I ask if she'd like to join us on a walk to the park, and she immediately declines and says she's going to nap until we get back. (eyeroll). Ok, MIL. She chooses to sulk because she only wants one on one time with my child, and refuses to share him (crazy much?) with his parents...I guess? 

As we are getting ready to head out the door, DS is carrying his favorite stuffed animal with him (he takes it everywhere, including in his crib every night while he sleeps). I allow him to bring it with him when we go outside from time to time, especially when he's feeling sensitive. MIL spots him carrying it, and says ""can grandma have your lovey while you're out? grandma needs a lovey; grandma's sad today"". I almost lost my shit. Besides the fact that she had just got back from a smoke, and reeked of it, why is she asking my child for his stuffed animal!?!? Ughhhhhhhhhhh.

I immediately shut it down, telling her that he takes it everywhere with him, and he needed to have with him. Cue more CBF and fake sad face. Good god, this woman needs therapy or something. 

She comes to our place looking for emotional support from my toddler and his stuffed animals. What's next? Will she ask to sleep in his crib with him???

I just needed to get this out. It's been bugging me for weeks, and this is the only place I can truly let it all out. Thanks for listening!",JUSTNOMIL
"Wow! So I had no idea this reddit even existed, or that covert incest was a thing, but that's got me thinking that this is the situation I'm in. Maybe someone can help clarify my situation or put it in to perspective. 

My mother in law is something else. When I moved in, I started noticing little things that weren't quite right. Some back story: we're both divorcees with teens. He owns his own house that he's shared with his mom since he was married to his ex. He inherited the house from his father who passed away, and his ex wife convinced him that it was only right to move his mom in since she took care of him and paid his way into private school and helped him when he went to college. Alone, she wasn't going to be able to afford her place. I get it. I probably would have said the same thing myself, tbh. Since his divorce, mom was basically the woman of the house for the last 7 years. 

Understandably, certain parts of the house are her domain, like the living room and the kitchen. I tried to be as helpful as possible, but once I got yelled at for straightening up a messy, disorganized cabinet in the kitchen, I gave up trying to keep tidy in there above and beyond any messes me and my children make. From the moment she wakes up until 8pm at night, she controls the TV and watches things I have zero interest in. I tried to be sociable and just let that go, but there's only so many lifetime movies I can watch in a year, let alone everyday of my life. We have a TV in our bedroom, so I just opt to hang out in there and watch my shows. No big deal. 

I started to notice that his kids don't go to him for anything. They want to go somewhere, they ask grandma. They want to do something, they ask grandma. They want to eat something, they ask grandma. They make plans, they run it by grandma first, then TELL dad that grandma is letting them do xyz. They go to dad for nothing. She tells them when to shower, brush teeth, go to bed. Dad doesn't have to do anything. It reminds me of a marriage. It's weird. Like, she's their mom and is rearing them and he's the dad that works and pays the bills. 

He keeps telling me it's my home, yet when I try to make it feel like home, I have to run it past his mom first. They have a huge entertainment center in the livingroom with pictures of his kids on top of it. School pictures came in and I asked HIM if we could put my kids pictures up as well. I had to ask HER first. Everything, every stinking little thing has to be ran by her first. He says things like it's his house and he can do what he wants, but when it comes down to it, mom has the first and final say. I don't feel like it's his house, and I certainly don't feel like the woman or the wife of the house. I feel like both designations belong to her. 

He told me that if I wanted her to back off and let me be the woman of the house, I had to get in there and act like the woman of the house, but as I mentioned before, when I straightened up a cabinet to my liking, I got yelled at. I have to ask her permission to redecorate, rearrange, etc... They've gotten into huge blow ups over it where I hear him yelling and sticking up for himself that it's his house and if she didn't like it, she could leave, but instead she locks herself in her bedroom and stops eating for a few days. Longest was a week. I feel like that's emotional abuse on her part, because eventually he goes crawling into her room to apologize and takes back everything he said and compromises with her, and ultimately she gets her way. 

I don't know, I've felt sometimes like they are the ones married and I'm just a guest. I've told him this time and again and nothing really seems to change. When I first started confiding to my own mother about things that were happening, before I could even tell her how I felt about it, my mom's exact words were, ""Who is he married to? You or momma?"" My mom also wonders if this has been an ongoing thing and the real reason his last marriage broke down. I believe him and what he says about that, but sometimes I wonder too. 

We get along well for the most part. She does tend to think I'm lazy because I have mismanaged depression and sometimes it kicks me in the butt, but I am working on that as hard as I possibly can with medication and counseling. He understands and he sees the lengths I've gone to in order to get a handle on it, but she's old school and views it as a weakness, a copout, when I have an episode. Some of their blowouts center around the fact that I just stay in my room isolated all of the time. She gets mad at us if we don't do things her way. The way we clean and do chores aren't up to her standards and she'll just sit there and bitch and complain to him about it. When he asks me why I don't come out of my room or why I'm not doing more around the house, the answer is simple. None of us want to deal with her attitude. I don't want to sit and watch lifetime movies all day long. I'm tired of getting yelled at for doing something that isn't correct in her eyes even though I busted my butt doing it. She's calmed down a bit more recently, but just her responses to us being there and how she controls him and everything he does, it makes me wonder... he's the baby of the family and for many years it was just the two of them. I can't post about anything on Facebook that has to do with money or he will get in trouble by her, like when we go places or have plans or anything. 
He has to run things by her all of the time. I get having respect for your mother and all of that, but sometimes it's just too much. He's an adult. Je pays the bills and shows up for work everyday of the year. He can't spend his money the way he wants on the things he wants??

Sometimes I feel like the only way things will get better is when she passes. I know that's wrong to think, but that's how I feel. He'll be devastated and I don't know if he'll ever be the same once she's gone, but all this controlling behavior will cease and maybe I can actually feel more like his wife and less like a third wheel. 

Am I wrong to feel how the title to this post implies? Is she secretly taking over the role of wife or already of the idea that she is the wife? Because she certainly acts like his wife!

Thanks for listening. Advice is appreciated!",JUSTNOMIL
"S due to the tires thing, dh has had increased contact with OSN and his dad.  We decided a few things before he called them (after he ignored three of their calls)

1- they can ask their preferred son and wife for the money first. We are the ones who always step up and help, bil and sil literally never do. I doubt it’ll come to anything

2- that while OSN had one meh apology and one so/so apology, that there’s a lot more she needs to account for, and that her poor me atttude in all the emails needs to stop

3- it’s still up to dh when to stop NC. I am struggling with that, but the truth is that I likely won’t have any contact with her regardless so it’s really more for him than for me at this point. 

So dh calls them on his way home yesterday.  They aren’t thrilled with having to ask bil for the money but will do it. Then dh tells her that she had a lot more to apologize for and that she needs to respect our boundaries going forward. Mil plays dumb, saying she had no idea what he’s talking about. That she had nothing else to apologize for and that she never pushes boundaries. Dh have a couple of examples and she tells him she doesn’t remember things like that. Hubby proceeds to get angry and to tell her that she better dig deep and figure it out, otherwise she will not be seeing him or the kids anytime in the near future. 

I’ve also let him know that I will no longer be referring to her as mom, (I used to call her mama, but stopped that six years ago when this all started). Going forward she will be referred to by her first name since she is not my mom and has made that abundantly clear through the years. Second, is that I will not be ending NC when he does. I don’t trust them in the least and I have zero desire to be around any of them. I deserve to put my time into things that are actually worth my while, instead of people who treat me like trash. 

On a weird side note - I dreamt that sil apologized to me, but it was out in public and really weird and I decided she was only doing it for mil’s sake (though it seemed genuine)...  but I told her I had no desire to be anywhere near her and that while the apology was nice that I wouldn’t be resuming contact.

"So sorry for the spelling and grammar. Also the obligatory I’m on my phone jazz. 

So I named my mother in law to be Flip Flop as she’s up and down constantly. She has some diagnosed and undiagnosed mental health issues. She now has careers involved twice a day and it’s really levelled her out she isn’t phoning my partner constantly anymore. Sadly I took a lot of the abuse when this was all changing so basically the last year. Her daughter and her who are frequently estranged made up. So now we are all supposed to act like she’s fine and it’s all hunky dory. The daughter so SIL for me nags my partner that his mum hadn’t seen him in ages. While freely admitting she hasn’t seen her in probably 6 months. It’s always all on my partner who is a sensitive sole. So I end up helping out. Now everyone’s forgiven her and acting like mother in law is fine I’m struggling with this. We were a unit all together backing each other up. The telling tales and stories has already started. Granted their fact checking this time but mostly they are about me. I’m sick of it and I haven’t forgiven her. I’m the one that got the worst of it but it’s assumed i’l deal and be fine with it as she apologised to her kids. 

I’m struggling as soon as have to deal with her my irritation levels up and I’m too harsh off the bat. I can feel it but I can’t calm down around her as she pushes my anxiety levels up so much.  I feel like I’m in between a rock and hard place.  My partner gets annoyed I get to riled quickly. I should add no contact isn’t an option but I keep it a low info diet and little contact as possible. However I’m constantly pulled in to sort the medical and admin issues. I don’t know how to calm myself down around her it’s like a red flag to a bull. I don’t like who I become.

"""Future husband"" has an insane mother. ""Future mother in law"" has an emotional incestuous relationship with my FH.
 
I noticed this was a problem when FH got a car, and a week later we both had to go to work at the same time. I forgot something in the car, he let me take the keys and run to work. 
FMIL texted FH ""What is [ME] doing with OUR keys?!"" 
Apparently one of FMIL'S friends saw me getting in the car and told her? 
FH said ""why are you spying on us"" 
FMIL threatened to kick my FH out on the street. 

Many things have happened since then. 

I've tried to show FH that FMILs behavior is not normal, and through my FH talking to  therapist, it was confirmed she has a ""Cover Incest"" relationship with him. 

It got worse when two months ago, FH was talking to FMIL about possibly changing his last name to mine. 
She had a meltdown, saying shes taking him out of the will. (He only wanted to to respect my father. Who treats him with respect.) 

I've asked for advice here in the past. And they all say to have no contact with her, and to take FMIL's control over him as much as possible. (Which I think FMIL has done on purpose so she can controll him. Anytime she is confronted she threatens something)

I did as I was advised, and told FH he needs to take away all FMILS control. ""I can, it's just my loans, car's name, and health insurance."" 

Today has shown that nothing has happened on his end. 
She texts him today saying ""I need to talk to you, I spoke with my lawyer today."" 

He comes back to tell me FMIL says 
""I need to know if you're changing you're name so I can arrange the will."" 
""[me] is slandering me on Facebook look I have an entire folder on my computer of screenshots of her posts I think are about me! If she doesnt stop I will take legal action if I have to!"" 

(Oh yeah. She was hacking into FH's Facebook until 2 months ago to read my Facebook. She found out about my secret wedding group, which is how we found out.) 

When telling him why didnt he ask how she's getting these screenshots? 
What has he done to set boundaries? 
What has he done to take her control away? 
He argues saying there's nothing he can do without making it worse. 

I called off the wedding in the middle of him saying ""just talk to her, you havent tried."" 
I'm so lost on what to do. But I'm done. I just want her to leave me the fuck alone. I'm thinking of going to the police myself for a reatraining order or something. I'm being stalked, shes a crazy stalker that I cant get away unless I leave him. 

He said he has therapy Thursday, FH is asking therapist for advice then. If nothing happens at all by Sunday I'm packing my bags. I have nowhere to go but I'm not living like this anymore.

"Hello all! I found this sub to be a great outlet to vent and a great place to gain insight and advice on how to go about dealing my MIL. So I’m back. 

One of the users that commented on my previous posts called her “Pitty Patty” and I lost it. My DH and I thought it was absolutely fitting and I’ve decided to call her that, given the past few days. 

I briefly mentioned in a few replies to comments and possibly a post that I’m having a few pregnancy complications and today I’m going to expand upon that and get into her “woe is me”. 

So I’m now 32 weeks pregnant. By all accounts, the doctors seem sure that my baby will have Down syndrome, given the markers and a few other diagnoses they have made. She has a heart defect and one known bowel issue which will be easily resolved through surgery post-birth. 

When we discovered that she would have Down syndrome, DH and I were shocked. It was like my whole world came crashing down. As time passed, we both came to the agreement that we were still incredibly excited and eager to have her.

So as we are coming to terms with the news (about 16/17 weeks pregnant) , I’m still suffering from a horrible bout of morning sickness and DH has been taking care of me and our DD. We hadn’t been going to church at that point. It wasn’t feasible with him working full-time with mandatory overtime, in addition to my morning sickness. I had the bad kind that confines you to the bathroom (hyperemesis). Thank god that period of my pregnancy is over. 

ANYWAYS. I digress. 

During this time, DH and I expressed to everyone how excited we were. We think that a child is a blessing no matter what, and we are both very aware of all the things having Down syndrome entails. We researched every diagnosis and after a few hiccups, truly accepted our diagnosis and leaned into it. We told our families, and my family (very just yes) are all so excited! I couldn’t believe it! With all the stigma behind Down syndrome, I thought we wouldn’t receive as much support as we did. 

When we told his family, FIL was very warm and receptive to us. It was evident that he was going to love her no matter what. I cried. Our MIL, I felt, put on a front. I didn’t say anything to my DH and decided to let it play out. I saw how overly exaggerated her emotions were when we talked about it. Too supportive. Too understanding. Too... much. I was very suspicious. I had never seen her act this way, but I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt... even we had to come around to the idea. We only asked her that she not share our diagnosis with anyone on Facebook, as DH and I are private people. CBF. Agreement. She seemed to resign herself. 

But then she started tagging DH in posts about Down Syndrome. We addressed it with her, asking her to respect our request once again. Word for word, she said, “I don’t know what I’m doing on Facebook!”. Mhm...... riiiiiiight. 

But the damage was already done. A ton of our friends started to flood my DH’s inbox asking questions. He decided to just ignore them and address them on his own time. 

At this point, I’m at week 20 when my grandma (very very very JUSTYES) calls me and says, “you know... I was at church and I heard the most peculiar thing. I just didn’t know if what I was hearing was right”

Me: “what did you hear?” 

JYGMA: “I heard Pitty Patty tell everyone how horrible it was that your baby was going to have Down syndrome.”

I felt like the the floor fell out from underneath.

Me: “she what?” 

JYGMA: “I don’t want to get anyone in trouble. I just thought you should know. She seemed to really love the attention...” 

DH and I were speechless. And my suspicions were confirmed. 

Going back to church was difficult in that we had to explain that we didn’t feel sorry for us and that we were excited to have her. Everyone was very confused because Pitty Patty was, “look at me! Look how horrible my life is since my grand daughter will have Down syndrome!” But in the end, she humiliated herself. She looked like the horrible one. We just let her lie in her bed that she made. 

But now, I’m 32 weeks pregnant. We met with the surgeons on Friday who told us to expect AT LEAST a one month NICU stay for our child’s diagnosis. We called my family to tell them and they said, “okay, let’s do this. We’re behind you every step of the way.” 

Pitty Patty? 
“My NICU experience was HORRIBLE, my child DIED (yes he did die but from vastly different circumstances than what we are anticipating and yes, it was horrible. I won’t take that from her).” She began to spin off about what she went through.

When she started going off about her NICU experiences, I had to leave the room. A part of me knew she was going to be this way, but it was overwhelming. She had twins but one of them passed away while in NICU care. I’ve heard this story almost every month for the almost three years I’ve been with DH. Every year on the birthday of her twins (BIL’s birthday) she gets a balloon and releases it into the sky to remember the lost twin. Not to mention the entire day is about him not being here. The entire week is a suffocating bout of depression for her and if you’re not sad, then she’s upset because you’re not sad with her. It doesn’t seem to matter if BIL is alive. She suffers and “no one understands”. BIL never really wants to celebrate his birthday with Pitty Patty and she cries about it. I can’t imagine why he doesn’t want to...

But after thirty years... idk. Idk what I’m expecting. My JUSTYES grandma told me she had a still birth twin with one of her children. She said, “yeah, it’s horrible, but you focus on what you have or else you’ll fall prey to the madness”. At this point, I honestly don’t know if I’m spoiled in how my family handles things or if Pitty Patty just... throws a pity party because she can. 

I think the thing I struggled with was that this whole thing is clearly not about her, but she can’t even put aside her own experiences... I’ll admit I should have known better.


I went back to see my DH after composing myself. We both decided since our DD2 will be requiring surgery, we will be having no visitors during my hospital stay, with the exception of my DD1. We want to bond with her as much as possible before her month long NICU stay. I came back as soon as he relayed this information to her. 

You guys. I turned around and walked right out of the room. She did not handle it well. 

Pitty Patty: “what do you mean? No visitors? I saw DD1, I should see DD2.” 
DH: “you will, just not after birth”
PP: “sigh.... will you tell me when she goes into labor at least?” 
DH: “um... sure.” 
PP: “I can watch DD1” 
DH: “We’ve got that under control. JYMIL is going to watch her.” 

You guys. I could hear the CBF through the phone. DH and I knew that she was just trying to find a way to get to see us in the hospital. She did not succeed. The only exceptions to our “no visitors” policy will be BIL’s DD because there isn’t any guarantee she will meet her new cousin before she goes back to the west coast, and my mom who will be watching our DD1. My mom will bring DD1 to see us in the hospital. 

But now it’s been a constant stream of, “this isn’t really happening to you. The doctors are wrong.” 

There are only so many ways to coddle someone before it’s annoying. I don’t know what I’m looking for here. I suppose it’s another rant. I honestly just don’t know how to handle her when she tells me that what is happening to me “isn’t real” and that the “doctors are wrong”.",JUSTNOMIL
"DW and I recently came across another thread on reddit about the dangers of ""Third Hand Smoke"", basically chemicals being left on the clothing/hands/hair of smokers. It is extremely harmful to babies and had us worried about my MILs smoking habits and handling our 2 month old daughter.

&amp;#x200B;

Up until this point, the relationship with MIL has been ok, there has been events happen in the past that I brushed aside because we weren't married or had a kid yet and I'm fairly laid back and don't let alot of stuff bother me. But now that we are married and have a daughter, her safety is my #1 priority.

&amp;#x200B;

So after some discussion, we decided to bring this topic up to MIL. My wife sent her a very respectful text asking if MIL would consider quitting smoking, and that if she had trouble quitting outright that she at least take precautions before handling our daughter (wash your hands/arms/face, change your shirt, do not kiss her and do not let your hair touch her).

&amp;#x200B;

We thought these were simple requests, not too much too ask. Apparently we were wrong. MIL flew off the handle and accused us of pushing her away and isolating her from her granddaughter. She brought up a few other things that have happened since our daughter was born (they wanted to come to the hospital as soon as my wife went into labour but we told them not to come until we were ready, that did not sit well with them and they threw a hissy fit then, also my wife is very protective of our daughter and is having a hard time letting other people hold her and gets nervous/stressed from that, she mentioned last weekend to her mother that our daughter did not like being held with her face to your shoulder, she liked to look at other people and be held so that she can see everyone, MIL snapped back ""I'll hold my granddaughter however I want"").

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, my wife tried to reason with FIL to reason with MIL but of course FIL is taking MILs side. I'm not going to post the exact reply but it was very rude/direspectful and my wife has been dealing with this negativity since she was a child and this was sort of an eye opener to us. If MIL can't even be bothered to do a few simple things to prevent exposing our daughter to third-hand smoke, than I don't think she really even cares about her as much as she claims (shes always posting on Facebook about ""her babbbbby"", and how grandchildren are ""sunshine"" etc etc).

&amp;#x200B;

I've since blocked both FIL and MIL from Facebook because this is just the start of a whole bunch of crap I can't be bothered to deal with. Wife is hesitant to but I want to nip this in the bud before it becomes a much bigger issue. When MIL is ready to come forward and apologize and promise to follow our safety precautions after smoking then maybe she can be allowed in our daughters life. Until then, we don't need this.",JUSTNOMIL
"I'm going to try to tell this as best as I can because already the details have faded from my mind. I guess fear and panic will do that to you.

Old Yeller and I had plans to practice driving tonight. She tried to bail, as usual, but right there in my therapist's office, with Therapist's advice, I was able to text her and try to hold her to tonight. I walked out of the office feeling so proud of myself.

I got home and killed a bit of time until I got a text from Old Yeller saying she was home. Thinking she was ready and wanted to go right that instant, I grabbed my stuff and headed to the living room. The first thing out of her mouth was ""I'm going to have a cigarette and then we'll go. I have bronchial pneumonia. [cue The Look/The Stare/the shark look that means she's obviously displeased] What's so important about tonight (meaning why do I absolutely need to go out driving tonight)?"" Since her glare had sort of shaken me, I sheepishly went ""...We had plans?"" and went back to my room to wait until she was ready.

This is the part where things start to get a bit foggy. I'm sorry if things seem vague, I may have trouble remembering exactly what was said or what specific order things happened in. I'll try to convey the situation to the best of my ability.

When she was ready, I went down and we got in my car. She starts it, and tells me to shut the heat off (when it was max cold and set to A/C) with almost a note of hysteria under her voice. I do so, and she sits there appearing like she's trying to get control of herself. Then she asks me where I want to go driving. I asked her to repeat herself because I didn't quite catch her the first time, and she snaps it at me a bit louder: ""*Where do you want to go to drive?*"" At this, I let all warmth and emotion drain from me and tell her where I want to go. 

Not wanting to look at her too long because I could tell she was getting pissy, I pull out my phone to busy myself with texting Boyfriend. He had told me not to panic before I left my computer to go drive. I was in the middle of telling him that she was starting up theatrics when she asks me ""what the fuck is your problem?""

Me: ...? What do you mean?

Her: [cold stare]

Me: That's an actual question, I don't know what you mean.

I don't remember verbatim what she said, but she basically went on about how the first thing she told me was that she was sick and that she couldn't even get enough air to walk from the house to the car, and that she had just wanted to stay home tonight so she could eat and breathe. She said she almost went to the hospital, I think? (This from the same woman who doesn't go to doctors ever because she doesn't like them and complains she can't afford to.)

My response was to tell her I didn't know she was so sick, that I hadn't found out about it until right before we went out (although by this point we were still sitting in the driveway), and that I wouldn't have made these plans with her if I had known it was that bad. She turned away and sat in silence for a few minutes, and then I heard her crying. I asked what was wrong, she shook her head. I told her she could tell me and I was willing to listen. She shook her head. I asked if she wanted me to take her to the hospital (??? with what driver's license, brain?). She shook her head.

She then tried to throw it in my face that she's been driving me to and from my summer job and taking me driving whenever I wanted to go. If I've had the order of events right up to this point, this might have been the point where the composure I had been working so hard to keep started to falter. I'm embarrassed to admit it. But I said I hadn't asked her to do any of that and she had volunteered herself to do it, but she didn't have to do any of that. I may have said something about her getting credit for trying because up until then she hadn't driven me anywhere since I was about 16. I definitely said something about how she cancels on me constantly and I was just trying to hold her accountable for once.

*That* set her off. She didn't like that. At this point things really get foggy. I can't remember what she said, only that she kind of yelled something at me. I said something along the lines of ""this is why our relationship is awful, you yell and scream at me and it scares me so much I have a panic attack."" Some more sentences may have happened, but from who I don't remember. I just know at one point I suddenly started dissolving. I started to hyperventilate and cry and snot all over the place and I was so annoyed about it, saying ""no, not now, I was trying to stay composed, why did this have to happen now?""

It lasted maybe two minutes and then I was able to calm down enough to stop my face from leaking everywhere. I said it didn't matter, we could go driving tomorrow or some other time or not go at all, but that I couldn't do it right now and I was going to go put pajamas on. I shut the door, and went straight to my room, locking the door.

It turns out that was a good idea because ***here's where shit gets real!***

The second I locked my door I fumbled my phone out and called my boyfriend because I was starting to hyperventilate again. He answered all concerned about me and I gasp out that I think I'm having a panic attack. He, being a sweetheart, talks to me and tells me to listen to his voice and slow my breathing. Once I start to calm down I begin to tell him what happened...

*...and then I hear knocking on my door.*

Immediately I go silent, just whispering to Boyfriend that she was knocking. I didn't answer her, and the knocking got more insistent. He told me not to answer. The knocking then turned to louder knocking and calling my name. I tried to ignore it but eventually she started seeming pretty insistent that I answer. So I go and ask what she wanted.

What followed was I'd guess about 20-40 minutes of back-and-forth. She started out crying and begging me to open the door, to which I said that no, I needed to be alone and take some time to myself. This went on until she started putting anger into her voice. She started demanding I open my door and see her. Then she started saying things like ""this is the last time I'm going to ask you,"" ""you have one more chance,"" before threatening to take away my phone, my car, and every door in my room. I kept telling her I just needed to be alone and wouldn't open the door but she wouldn't fucking listen to me because apparently her fee-fees were more important than my need to calm down and stop having a panic/anxiety attack. At one point Boyfriend literally told me that if she started threatening me or I thought she would get violent, I needed to hang up from him and call the police. I wasn't concerned about her being violent, she was just scaring the shit out of me with her most-likely-empty threats and not respecting my boundaries.

Eventually she went away, at which point I dragged the laundry basket out of my closet so there was more space inside and hid in the closet. Still with my boyfriend on the line, I kind of gave him a rundown of what had happened, though he'd heard my half of it. He told me to get off the phone with him and call my trusted aunt as soon as possible so she could talk Old Yeller down, because I couldn't do so myself at the moment and she wouldn't listen to me.

So I did, rather reluctantly, and Aunt and I talked a while. During which the knocking and demands for me to open the door started again. Again I tried to ignore it, but eventually Aunt suggested I just go tell her through the door that I could not talk to her right now and I needed her to leave me alone so I could calm down. It took a bit of time, but after another round of crying, then anger, then a defeated ""do you want me to leave you alone and never talk to you again? Do you want us to just be done?"" she finally fucked off.

At that point Aunt said I needed to deal with this somehow or it would just get worse, so she helped me draft an email to Old Yeller about how much it scares me when she yells and screams and threatens, and how I don't want to have a huge fight every time we misunderstand each other. I said I wanted to communicate about our problems through email if I couldn't do it in person, and signed off saying this didn't have to be the end.

She didn't come back to my room, but I did get a text saying ""I wanted to apologize to you face to face and hug you one last time. I love you. Your feelings towards me will not change that. I will always love you. I'm sorry I was not better at showing it."" I responded telling her this wasn't the last time we'd talk and that we should let it rest for tonight. Then I finished up my call with Aunt before calling Boyfriend back because even though I was feeling better I just wanted to talk to him.

-----

That's the whole horrible story, so can I just rant for a second if I haven't hit the character limit?

***WHAT THE FUCK IS WITH THIS BITCH???*** Here I was on the other side of my locked bedroom door telling her over and over again that I needed to be alone and calm down, and she just didn't fucking listen because clearly *sheeeeee* was the more important one and *her* feelings were more important than mine. She desperately needed to hug me and apologize *so fucking bad* that she **cried, begged, and then threatened me.** Nevermind that I spent that whole few hours trying not to hyperventilate, whispering into my phone across the room from the door where she couldn't hear, and then literally ***hiding in my closet crying and trying to stay quiet while not panicking.***

But no. Fuck me and what I need. It's not important. She needed her emotions tended to more. Fuck my need to be alone and calm down, and fuck the fact that her lurking outside my door was absolutely not helping that endeavor and in fact making it so much worse. Twice I literally whispered into my phone to my boyfriend ""help me,"" I was that scared.

I try to set a boundary: please leave me alone so I can calm down, and she just doesn't fucking listen and stays out there because of course what she wants supersedes everything else, even her terrified grown-ass adult daughter hiding in a closet crying and scared.

"Trigger Warning: Assault. Very light assault mentioned.

I've commented time and time again that one day I would tell the stories of my own JustNoMom.

Well, today is finally that day.

**Backstory:** My mother is usually just a normal to JustYes mother. She loved and supported my sister and I, spoiled us, cared for us, and tried her hardest. Which makes her JustNo moments so hard for me, because, well, if 90% of the time she's wonderful, do I want to cut her out of my life?

Growing up, my mother would have what I call ""flair ups."" She would be okay, then something would snap. And anywhere from a couple to six weeks, she would be moody and passive aggressive, if something set her off, she would rage out, and I spent those times walking on eggshells. Horrific bouts of yelling and saying nasty things to myself, my sister, and my father. Throwing out our shit. Trashing a bathroom. And those aren't the worst (I'll tell the used tampon in the bathroom sink story later.)

Well, in March of 2017, she had a horrible flair up resulting in me getting thrown out of the house, trying to have me committed to a Psych Ward by calling 911, and me running barefoot out of my house at midnight. But that, again, is another story for another time.

I cut her out for about six months. Then I slowly let her back in my life. And things were okay.

**Backstory Over.**

Until January 2019.

My little sister is a cosmetologist and so she and I met up at our mother's house and she started bleaching my hair. She and I started snipping at each other (we don't get along, but can be amicable.) And, yeah, I should have been an adult and taken the high road, but I didn't. I snipped back and the fighting escalated.

Now, my little sister has anger issues. And she swung at me and nailed me right on my left eyebrow.

I saw red. I stepped towards her to swing back. Now, even in that state, I realized I would win that fight hands down. She is a 21 year old cosmetologist who's never had to work a physically demanding job. I went to a military college, I work out regularly, I worked for an engineering consulting firm which had me out and around lifting and moving heavy equipment on constructions sites in 100 degree heat, etc. Basically, me beating her up would not be a win I would feel good about. In that rage state, I just wanted to give her a tit for tat. A good punch back to remind her not to try that again.

But from what my mother saw, my sister decked me and I was coming towards her. So I would not have blamed her had she just stepped in.

What she did however, was wrap her arm around my throat and hold me in a chokehold. At some point in that struggle, my bra got slashed. I have no idea how, so that should give you an example of the chaos.

My hair is full of bleach. Bleach is getting on everything. My skin, her skin, my clothes, etc.

She's screaming at my sister to call my dad. I'm screaming at her to let me go. And she just keep holding me in the chokehold.

I finally get her to let me go. And she goes off about how I'm everything that is wrong with this family. I caused all the problems growing up. Blah, blah, blah.

Mind you, she says NOTHING to my sister who SWUNG ON ME.

She then walks into the kitchen and lays on the floor saying how her chest hurts. My little sister then falls on the floor next to her, crying, saying how it'll be okay and how she is her best friend and all that stuff.

*Wow, that sounds heartless, I\_Am\_Echo. Your mother could have seriously been having an issue.*

My mother was an RN for almost 30 years, a trauma room nurse for over a decade, and a CHEST PAIN nurse for almost a decade. Both of her parents had multiple heart attacks. If she was seriously having chest pains, she would have had us call an ambulance, not lay on the floor wailing for attention, brushing off my little sister's pleas for what she could do for help.

In that moment, I decide I'm done.

I walk to the laundry room sink, wash the bleach out of my hair to the best of my ability, and leave.

Other than times I had to speak to her, I was NC.

My father was our go between for communication.

She made me an Easter basket which my father brought to me during one of our drop off sessions (he would meet up with me to bring me insurance papers, car tags, etc.) He asked me to text her Happy Mother's Day and to thank her for the Easter Basket.

I did, mainly because it would make my life easier to do so rather than not. It was the most plain and simple text: ""Thank you for the Easter Basket. Happy Mother's Day.""

I guess that was what ignited the communications again.

She stopped using my father as the middle man and would text me about my contact prescriptions and other important things like that (with her having worked in the medical field, we all decided to let her handle insurance and stuff for the family. And because I live with roommates and have moved with them recently/am planning on moving again soon, I get my contacts and car stuff sent to their house.)

Okay, fair. Simple and important stuff.

Then today I get a text asking if I'll be on her side of town on Thursday because important items are here for me to pick up.

I say yes. She asks when because she is getting a mani/pedi and asks if I want to join her.

I'm flabbergasted. Are we just...pretending like you assaulting me never happened?

I decided back in January that I would not break my VLC/NC unless she apologized first. Was I in the wrong for not adulting up and stopping the bickering with my sister? Yes. But she and my sister ASSAULTED me. And I want a damn apology. Then I will apologize.

So...I need advice. What do I do? How do I handle this?

"Hello all;

Big fan- long time reader- SO MUCH INFORMATION GOLD TO BE FOUND ON THIS SITE 💎❤️ 

I want to share my story about my MiL; NERAK (or the Watcher in the Woods)

All events are current and moving forward I intend to navigate the waters and set the tone. I cannot believe it took this much pushing and back and forth with a sixty five year old woman but it is what it is.

Emotional intelligence may be the highest form of intelligence but is also not intuitively learned for some.... I understand her pitfalls of comprehension of these topics and I am extending out the olive branch with full expectation that she will ingest the books and knowledge we have given to her and that she will follow her son’s leadership and guidance and we can move forward in a new way that is saturated with respect. Respect for me; new respect for herself; and perhaps a smidgen dose of what empathy and theory of Mind and codependency is. 

I set the ultimatum that if she was going to continue to avoid me and treat us like this—— then just erase us from her life completely and forget that we ever existed. 

Because truly, when is enough enough? 

Her control issues and anxiety issues and codependency issues and the narcissism were patterned in her long before I ever showed up—— I’ve got my hands deep in the messy work helping my husband untangle his messy emotional self and setting the pace for our son. We are a family on the ASD spectrum but my son is the first diagnosis and there has been a lot of denial and just..... bad behavior. I told her I don’t have time to play games.

Amazing she could apologize after I mentioned my 3 year old could own up to his mistakes. 

The long story of the drama isn’t so much as one big event but more a series of poorly navigated life transitions and a lot of communication difficulty (particularly alexithymia and social pragmatic speech disorder alongside ASD traits). My MiL doesn’t have evil intentions but I believe she was modeled into and after the societal standards she saw around her as “the way to be” in the good ole 1950’s and quite frankly she’s not a run of the mill “fits into a box” kind of a person. She’s very high energy and bright and spiritual and incredibly loving—— buuuuuuuuuuuut we all know how those things with and alongside other traits (persistence; stubbornness; unwillingness or inability to see things from my perspective; lack of empathy; resistance to change or be open to new ideas) can really do a lot of damage because she’s a big ole boundary stompers who throws toddler fits when I confront her and she’s surrounded by a world of enablers and she is patterning her other children in unhealthy ways and oh yeah it’s done a ton of damage to my marriage which was my shot at this happiness thing.

 Soooooo there’s a lot of “little” incidents and over the Christmas holiday there was a pretty big one that started as me leading everyone in MAKING A CHRISTMAS CRAFT AS A GIFT TO HER and ended with me having to call the police from the neighbors house with my baby in arms and my 11 year old after having sustained a physical attack from my FiL &amp; JustNOSiL because of behaviors from my MiL that set me into a panic attack and then I was blocked into the basement kitchen and after I pushed through and my son was ripped out of my hands whilst I was screaming LET ME OUT LET ME GO at the top of my lungs my see you next Tuesday JUSTNOSiL tried to block me on the steps 4x and I punched her in the face and broke her glasses at the top of the steps

BECAUSE WOMAN YOU DONT MESS AROUND ON STAIRCASES WHILE YOURE HOLDING A BABY

And bad things happen in basements

I’ve watched way too many episodes of Forensic Files to mess around in that scene—- and my fight or flight response knows it. 

Anyhow, I escaped and the cops came and my husband and our family left..... lots of typical narc behavior, threats from Flying Monkey failed lawyer SiL and she even uninvited me from her parents funeral. Lots of BS treatment of husband from his mother. Lots of emotional crying and wishing it never happened. Lots of avoidance. 

Just.so.much.

The birthday party she threw for herself THE DAY BEFORE OUR CHILDREN’S 1st/3rd BIRTHDAY PARTY
because she was not invited to ours..... and many of her relatives boycotted our party it seems.... because she is the gatekeeper (she feels) to her side of the family. 

Anyhow; the story is much longer than these action snippets allude to :D of course I’m in a mobile and so on and so forth

But the gist of it all—- is that I’m moving forward. I will take all advices or good vibes in how to navigate and how to stomp out the crap when it comes up. I will chop out all the bad behaviors and give them books to keep enlightening themselves and I will give positive reward as curated opportunities to enjoy grandchildren. But I am not interested in any personal emotional relationship with or ever again at this point. It shouldn’t take 5 months to apologize if they really cared about ME as a person. That’s okay. Whatever. I’m fine with that. But they will treat me with respect. I will never again settle for anything less.

And oh yes, my husband also knows it. He has new healthy habits and daily readings to keep up with. I quit smoking for him years ago and this is basically a relational equivalent. If it takes purposeful effort everyday to carve new habits and ways of being than so be it. So be it. That is the loving push but he has to get over the Pathological Demand Avoidance and trust it. He’s learning. I’ll give him that credit.  

I’ll attach at the end the aggravating email I sent to MiL (Exhibit A) and then the text I sent after I had my husband call to ask about some missing things from his childhood possessions he picked up over the weekend (Exhibit B) and then her apology- which is way long overdue.

My purpose of this post- 

Don’t give up hope Redditers!

I’m pushing to meet tomorrow at her favorite public prayer park with the kids and her new puppy. We’ve got a short window we will say for. I’m definitely expecting tears. She hasn’t seen me in awhile so she might not recognize I’ve morphed into MamaNoNonsense2.0 who can lead with a loving spoonful of sugar but will drag your ass back in line with her iron fist of ALL THAT IS GOD’S GLORY. 

❤️ Send me spoons 🥄 

Exhibit A: Email i sent after my husband made it clear she was just a confused old woman after 5 months of this nonsense. So I titled the email 
“Confused Old Woman”
Dear NERAK,

It has come to my attention that you are still confused about what happened on our holiday visit and some of the relevant details have escaped your memory. This is concerning to me and I would suggest getting your memory checked as it could be an early warning sign for dementia. 

The first major issue, besides that you didn’t bother to consult me about the needs for my craft activity and you shoved the whole thing in your awful basement, was that you don’t respect me. At all. Not even a little bit.

How do I know this? Because when your son, my husband, treats me disrespectfully, you defend HIM when I point these things out and get upset. You yourself then continue the disrespectful treatment of ME. 

Not cool NERAK. 

I have always gone out of my way to treat you with the utmost of kindness and respect and let me remind you how successful your cookie party was with the kids BECAUSE I DIDN’T TRY TO TAKE OVER OR RUN IT AND DIDN’T INTERRUPT YOUR EFFORTS.
I treated you with respect so you could enjoy the activity and have the outcome you wanted.

I planned the craft as a gift to you. It was all for you. But you wanted to control everything about that too.

Not cool.

You have no right to interrupt me if I am in the middle of something with my family. My husband is my family. My rights to PRIVACY with MY HUSBAND come before any imagined right  you have to talk to him as your child (which he is no longer a child and has made a legal oath to me- remember if you can it was kind of a big deal).

When you attempted to interrupt and I told you NO, you got mad. You lost it at me and amped up your ridiculous behavior and when you started yelling and screaming at me that you can walk wherever you want in your own house and you can do whatever you want; that was when I made the decision to leave because your behavior wasn’t rational to my request. Also your response was super emotionally unhealthy. 

Sorry you didn’t notice all the smaller details I was working with (hot glue gun on the counter; canvas with wet paint in my hand WHILE I WAS ALSO HOLDING MY TWO SMALL CHILDREN) but that didn’t matter to you—- your request to interrupt to boss HUSBAND around and control his creative flow  was more important to you. 

Never mind that wasn’t even the first interruption; which all of the interruptions were crazy rude. No one seems to tell you how rude your actions come across. I’m sorry it can be hard to hear sometimes but I’ve always tried to be kind and just figured you weren’t fully aware of how you were coming across. But that visit you really crossed the line big time. I don’t appreciate how you treated me or allowed your family to treat me at all.

I don’t appreciate how you think you can tell me how to parent my son when we have several professionals we have been working with and guiding us who aren’t in denial that he is Autistic.

I don’t appreciate how you blocked me into your awful basement kitchen after I called you a crazy bitch and said we were going to leave. I call a spade a spade- the way you flipped out on me for my perfectly reasonable request to not interrupt was definitely crazy bitch behavior. You showed you were not a respectful person and not safe to continue to be around—- BECAUSE YOU PUSHED ME INTO A PANIC ATTACK AND THEN BLOCKED ME IN.

Were you trying to fight me? Why would you have blocked me in? Is it fair that you ripped my child from me when I tried to squeeze past? I only started screaming because I couldn’t escape for a breath of fresh air and you wouldn’t let me out. Did you want me to assault you to escape? I’m so confused 🤷‍♀️ 

Because then you let your husband and awful daughter attack me when they had no right. I have photographs of the physical assault that left me with bruises and scratches all over—- much more than a simple grab at me would have produced.  Someone must have longer nails than they realized... The things your daughter has said to me are entirely awful and she’s an awful person. Kudos to supporting that hot mess. Our family has been disinvited from your funeral someday so good luck with that 👍

Treat me however you want; I’m not afraid of you—— but the way you have treated your son is absolute garbage. Trash can behavior. I don’t believe for a second that you allow God’s unconditional nonjudgmental love to flow through you. 

I accept you will never apologize to me because you are deep in denial. Whatever. I understand so much more of your behavior and trauma than you’ve ever divulged and probably realize yourself. God is good like that and helps healers work with all the messy roots that have to be ripped out and reworked. I’ve always ever been about healing and moving forward and making new. 

HUSBAND is in good hands. God loves him so much MORE than your flawed human efforts can. He is learning and growing in so many wonderful ways and his being of self is growing and expanding the way it should have always been. 

That’s the magic of healthy boundaries and allowing him to be a grown ass man.

You can’t control everything and you can’t have your “helping” hands in everything. 

Please stop comparing HUSBAND to his siblings who were never raised to know or even understand what a healthy boundary is. It’s not normal and it is why they have such deep anxiety issues and avoidance tendencies. 

How you treat BiL like he is a door mat you can arrange and walk all over us beyond the scope of anything appropriate. He and his wife  have both been raised to be avoidant people pleasers (likely so were you) and who knows what level of bullshit you will have to get to before they recognize your boundary stomping is causing them a lot of undue stress and other issues. 

For as much loving intention as you have; your behavior comes off in a lot of very unloving ways and has a lot of unintended consequences. 

I won’t rehash our whole history, ain’t nobody got time for that; but I would have stood up to you the first time you got pushy if I realized, then, how much of a red flag your behaviors were and how much of a deep vein of disrespect you really have.

NERAK, your son is autistic and so is his son. They also have neurological differences in speech processing. As these things are genetic I would strongly suspect you also are affected by such. Your behaviors tick off way more boxes on the diagnostic criteria than theirs do.... so maybe that’s room for thought. 

The dr explained the need for Autism support similarly to someone who needs glasses. Before glasses were popular or affordable- families would go without or use eye strengthening exercises- but it was never fully restorative to vision the same way glasses allow. I’ve done the work to get my son “glasses” so his brain doesn’t struggle to learn the same scope as what others are learning. My husband, on the other hand, is at a deep disadvantage starting this work now; you can get by life with a neurological disability until someone gets close enough to figure it out (lucky me) but now we have the resources to support and aren’t dealing with deep denial and toxic dismissiveness. 

Autistics require support because their brains learn information differently. They process it differently. They don’t pickup on facial cues or emotional body language the same.  They are more sensitive to sounds and noises and so many things. They require behavioral management techniques to train the brain properly. There’s so much to it and we’ve still got so much more to learn. 

 We’ve been working for the last year and this work continues for a lifetime. If my son and husband and children are thriving it is because of the invisible hard work we are putting in everyday. It is because my husband, for the first time in his entire life, has learned the concept of EMOTIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY and HOW TO APOLOGIZE. Which has been recognized as something he wasn’t taught and didn’t learn from you. I’m not surprised but the information applied in our life has made a difference. I’m sorry I thought he had learned those things like most emotionally healthy people do. 

I can’t expect you to understand; but I thought you would at least be respectful of our journey. I’m sorry you can’t. I’m sorry you and your husband have felt the need to “cut us out of your life” and “as if you don’t have any grandchildren”. (You pulled that on us also when I was pregnant and not speaking with my family for good reason). Do you realize how hurtful your words and behaviors have been? I’m sorry you’ve put the burden of communication on my husband and that you’re hung up in your toxic family patterns so much that you’ve bad mouthed me to your relatives and poisoned your entire family against us. Thanks for that 👍 really appreciated 👍 does it make you feel better knowing that you’ve won your family? 

Congratulations because now you have a life that can be almost the same as it was before I ever showed up—- me and my awful self and my Autistic kids. You’ve got your replacement grandchild PUPPY for attention and all the time in the world to enjoy whatever it is you please.

Sorry, my husband isn’t available to talk about birds. He won’t be speaking to anyone who can’t treat him and his family with respect. I am his wife, remember? You can’t ignore me and have access to all my hard work of my life. 

I hope you have a happy and healthy life and that my words clarify my perspective— I know you were struggling to put yourself in my shoes but I do hope you won’t require an “animated Italian woman” to yell and scream at you and block you into a kitchen in order to learn. 

See you in the afterlife  🤷‍♀️

With regards,

DingDongCalling

Exhibit B: The final Ultimatum text from me to her

“The time to apologize was before I even left your house the day after Christmas. How much more time do you want before you are willing to admit how disrespectfully you treated me and how unwarranted the attack on me was? 

We are sick of the games. Even my 3 year old can admit when he's wrong and made a mistake.

You aren't willing to even do that and yet everything I ever do to you is ""mean"".

Whatever NERAK. Take it all to your counselor; write it all in your book; whatever; you wanted to cut us out of your life and give us all the space- now you've got it. You pushed so hard you've pushed us completely away. 👍

Hope you enjoy total freedom from us and please just forget you ever even knew us. Because if you felt like we were worthwhile you wouldn't be playing these games and throwing the relationship with us away without even making a real effort to move forward.

Actions always speak louder than words and you've run your mouth enough to show you don't give a damn about me or my kids.

Have a great life NERAK.

Exhibit C: THE LONG AWAITED APOLOGY

DINGDONG, I did call and left a voicemail for you. I am sorry for everything that happened that night: for not understanding your boundaries when you asked me not to interrupt, for raising my voice and causing more of an argument and not walking away from it. I will be emailing you in response to your email later. My husband and I are reading the boundaries book that HUSBAND lent us to help us better understand.

"Obligatory mention of background in my first post, jumbled thoughts, etc.  


Today was my birthday (woo!) and other than the parts with JNM in it, it was great. I spent time with my friends, did some painting with them at an art club party scheduled already, and just had a generally relaxed day. I spent most of it in JYF's custody, but after 8pm, I unfortunately had to go back to JNM. The only mention of my birthday before this was just a short text from her saying ""Happy birthday Anon"". I was a little upset by how much it seemed like she didn't care, but I moved on pretty quickly.  


After I got back to JNM's place, I booked it to my room and holed myself up in there to just be away from her. After an hour or two of silence, she banged on my door and demanded that I open up. She first question she asked me was why I was still in outside clothes, which I found kind of weird since she never cared about that before, but brushed off. 

&amp;#x200B;

She then proceeded to ask me about my day, and if I went out to dinner with JYF. When I said that we were going to do it some other night since I had to be with her during the night, she just gave me a condescending scoff. She then asked why I had paint all over my hands, so I told her that I had gone to the art club party with my friends. She took offense to the fact that I didn't invite her to it, since she usually went to all of the previous ones, and asked me why I didn't tell her about it. I replied that I didn't like being around her that much, and that her tone made me upset. That made her more angry.  


It didn't help much that I was trying to grey rock through the entire argument either. I kept my cool and tried to respond to her with as few words as possible in a calm voice, but it just pissed her off more. She yelled at me that I was being rude and that I never wanted to spent any time with her anymore. I asked her if she needed anything else from me, and she left after that.  


Other than the cold text and the argument, she didn't acknowledge my birthday at all. I'm not really sure if I'm upset she didn't pay much positive attention to me today or if I'm glad she mostly stayed out of my way. It sure beats my 13th birthday when she took me to someone else's birthday party, though.",JUSTNOMIL
"It was a bank holiday in the UK yesterday so I suggested to DH that we go on a little family outing to a National Trust property about half an hour away from where we live. DH suggested that we “throw ET a bone” by inviting her to come with us. This irritated the fuck out of me as it meant I would spend our family outing irritated and on high alert. So I said fine but that fills our monthly quota for June so if she whinges about not seeing DD she can suck eggs.

So ET and SFIL live very close by to this property and showed up before we did. By the time we found them she was signing up for a joint membership. Now, DH and I have been National Trust members since I was pregnant as we thought it’d be lovely for days out with DD. ET and SFIL havent been members for YEARS. So of course we both knew they’d signed up coz ET is hoping for more outings like this at the very least. Well suck eggs ET. You’re not being invited to anymore outings like this if I can help it. She hasn’t been to a NT property in years either so definitely know what her game is.

Both her and SFIL (usually JY) spent the whole visit trying to touch DD and talk to her and get up in her face eventho I was baby wearing. I kept having to walk away as DD doesn’t like it when ppl get up close in her face. At lunch she kept doing the hand grabby thing across the table but she was in a high chair between DH and I and I was trying to feed her purée . When we went to sit in the cafe she stuck her hands across the table and said “are you coming to grandma?”. My response, “no she’s happy sitting on mummy aren’t you?”. CBF could be seen from across the universe. I then proceeded to whip my boob out to feed her which stopped the hand grabby and allowed me to ignore her. I successfully managed to keep her out of both their hands for the whole 4-5 hours.

ET then started asking me if anyone at nursery had held her yet. Erm why would they when she hasn’t started nursery? You’d know that if you pulled your head out of your arse every now and again.. I’m guessing she’s hoping that once DD is at nursery that she’ll tolerate ppl holding her. Well newsflash ET, DD will only be handled by her key person not random ppl. And I fully intend to ensure that she stays away from you and your boundary crossing kisses. Idiot. 

During the day she kept rudely interrupting or stopping conversations to talk to DD like at the baby shower. DH has definitely realised this happens. I pointed out that this is very rude and obsessive behaviour. It’s gotten to the point where he doesn’t show DD on FaceTime anymore unless he’s certain a topic of conversation has finished. Otherwise he knows she won’t ever complete a conversation.

On the way back to our cars we stopped by their car coz apparently a friend of theirs bought a “new” car seat and couldn’t use it so wanted to see if we’d take it off them. The bloody thing looked about 10 years old and was at least 2 stages too old for DD. I firmly said “no thank you. It looks very old and doesn’t meet today’s safety standards. It’s also for much older children (to ensure they didn’t try to palm it off on BIL for his soon-to-be-born baby)”. They then offered us a ride back to our car. But they have no car seat!

It’s just cemented my determination that neither of them are to be left alone with DD as they don’t care enough to research current safety standards. No outings without us. No overnight stays. Basically no unsupervised contact EVER. 

SFIL tends to be JY most of the time but has plenty of JN behaviours when it comes to DD. He constantly tries to get her to play with his hands and also proudly tells us about the times when he babysat his daughter’s kids how he did things like accidentally left them in elevators etc. He also likes to ask DD stuff like, oh do you want this ice cream? NO. She’s 8 months old. It’s OUR decision as parents. He also tried to put some manky hat that was in the museum on her head. I immediately said “no I don’t know where that’s been”. 

Then today I messaged both our families asking for photos of them for DD’s family book that the nursery will create for her. It’s meant to help the social and language development as it allows them to talk about family and ppl close to them. I’d asked for photos of them in pairs or their family units. So basically pairs of grandparents and pairs of the uncles and aunties. I told ET I was going to use a lovely photo we’d taken of her and SFIL yesterday. She then sends me this god awful photo she’d had taken of her and DD months ago. Bearing in mind it’s blurry anyway. Asks that that be put in instead. Erm no I specifically asked for a specific type of photo. I’m not putting in a photo of you and DD for you to pretend like you’re a favourite when nobody else has a photo like that. Suck some fucking eggs with a side of bacon while you’re at it. I’ve just responded with “I’ll see what I can do” but fully intend to ignore that photo and send photos of the completed book so she can see that I didn’t give in to her demand. I can be a passive aggressive bitch too, ET!

Rant over! Thank you for reading if you got this far and may your lives be free of JustNo aggravation!

"Long time lurker, first time posting. 

My MiL is a piece of work, in my opinion. I've known my husband 25 years, but we've only been together for 9 years, married 7. We have 4 kids between us. He had 2 (that I have since legally adopted), I had 1 and we have 1 together.   Before I came into the picture, my now D(ear)H was the sole breadwinner and his ex was a stay at home mom, who didn't take care of the house or kids. Drugs were involved. All I hear about from this time period is that ""I was the only reason those kids were taken care of...."" which created a lot of boundary issues when it came to me stepping i to a parental role. 

About 5 years into our relationship, she showed up at our house for coffee, and it was about a 2 hour conversation where she cried and made excuses for keeping me ""at a distance"". I'm DH's 3rd wife and she just doesn't trust that I'm going to be around. She's not letting herself feel like i'm her daughter to keep her heart safe. She knew me before and doesn't feel that motherly thing because I was a friend first. Blah. Blah. Blah. 

Things are very strained between us and without intention, I've gone VLC with her. She stresses me out. She does try to guilt DH into visiting more, but as he's first year in a new profession, his time is very limited. 

Every time they come over it is unannounced. 9am on a Sunday? Perfect time to just show up. 6pm on a week night while I'm trying to get a kid's birthday dinner on the table? Stop by with a card. It's always inconvenient.

Recently she's taken to making plans with my children. She's taking an out of state road trip in the summer and spoke to my 12 year old son about it, asking him to go and planning stops, before discussing it with DH and me. Or she wanted my 8 year old to spend the night so spoke to her about it. And the  complained she didn't get a phone call with details. She didn't bring it up to us and my 8 year old doesn't have a phone. How is she supposed to call? Is that weird? It feels like she's constantly putting us in the position of being bad guys by saying no to something she's convinced them they want to do. 

My daughter had a band concert. My MiL walked up to us in the audience, said 'I'm wearing rose oil. I'm sorry. I forgot you're allergic' and sat down right in front of me.

I could go on and on, but I fear I'm babbling and I constantly question whether I'm crazy and she's normal. Am I making a mountain out of nothing? 

Give it to me straight.",JUSTNOMIL
"So, I just had my wedding and it largely went great- except for running out of chairs and food because my mother in law brought uninvited people to the wedding. My mother in law’s English isn’t so great, and she chalks up the miscommunication to cultural differences, but I can’t let it go. It feels both presumptuous, selfish and rude- to me, it felt like she is taking advantage of how much money and time we put into making the event happened. The wedding wasn’t ruined, but I’m stuck on this and want to know if I’m the asshole here. 
1. “Courtesy invites” - MIL requested extra invites to send to her friends as keepsakes - i complied as I didn’t want to die on that hill - and 4 of these people thought they were real invites and came. 
2. Kids. we wanted a no kids wedding, and she didn’t enforce this with her nephews, so 8 kids we didn’t invite showed up. 
3. Random family members - an entire family from Brazil showed up that wasn’t invited. 
4. RSVP changes without letting us know - 2 folks who initially rsvp’d no changed their status last minute, and she never communicated it to us.

In total, about 20 extra uninvited people came, totaling about 2,000$ in unplanned-for costs and the embarrassment of having so many people come without name tags prepared or thank you gifts prepared to them. I want to confront her but I worry even the most therapy messaged confrontation will be taken as an insult..",JUSTNOMIL
"Im 19 female, boyfriend is also 19. Been together for 4.5 years. Boyfriend and family is all polish (but reside in the UK) boyfriend is the only fluent english speaker. His dad can speak English rather well, his mum I cannot talk to other than say a few things.

My name is Rowan. Said Row-anne or Row-un if you are a more lazy speaker. Not very hard.

 In poland all girls names end in an A as its feminine. The problem is my boyfriends family change my name to fit their language. Rowan doesn’t translate to anything in polish. So his family change my name to rowanka

Rowanka as in sounds exactly like Row-wanker

This really annoys me. Mainly because of what it sounds like but also because my boyfriend has asked them to just call me Rowan multiple times and they wont. They say its unladylike. So i will be having a bit of a conversation with his dad and he will be talking english but still call me Rowanka. 

What annoys me is 1. Not only do i call them their polish names and not translate it to their English versions (dad is dawid - EN David) + (mum is dorota - EN Dorothy) but 2. They get a bit pissy with me for not knowing as much polish as they’d like me to know when they cant even say my name properly, or can but choose not to. (I can say things like hello, you okay, thanks for dinner it was great, can i have ..... , thankyou for.... , then say a lot of the foods and random words) I personally think it makes more sense for them to learn English (at least some if they want to talk to me) as they live in the UK and have done for 13 years. 

What do i do? They know I dislike it but they just do it still. I can’t personally ask them to stop. I don’t see whats so hard about saying my name. Ive never met any other foreign person that has done this to my name before. Any advice?

Edit: I understand its. Grammar thing, I personally don’t care. Their names don’t fit English grammar and pronunciation but i don’t change it. Its also not a cultural issue. I know plenty about poland and have been many times. Celebrate many polish traditions and holidays.",JUSTNOMIL
"UGH I just noted the *their* typo, please forgive me!

Older BIL brought his 2 kids and younger BIL was playing with child 1 while DH and older BIL played with child 2. Things got rough, MIL started yelling while icing cupcakes, and child 1 fell back and hit his head on the table (he was totally fine, laughing got up and ran away) and MIL LOST IT!

"I’m due to have my first baby in a couple weeks and I don’t know what to say to my MIL. 

I was hanging out with my husband’s extended family yesterday. My MIL and I were talking about the baby and I mentioned we are not having visitors at the hospital and she can visit when we get home. Her face was like watching 5 stages of grief, she started to cry, and said she was beyond sad and disappointed and walked away.  I just sat there in disbelief as she is incredibly supportive with decisions my husband and I make and her reaction caught me off guard. We mentioned to her we want to talk about it and she didn’t want to talk about it then and there. 

We left and I was telling my husband the reasons why I don’t want visitors (recovering and in pain, need time as a family of 3, breastfeeding, etc). We didn’t really talk about it before so he said he didn’t agree with me but supported me regardless. I told him the idea of having people see in the hospital gave me so much anxiety and then all of sudden, I’m having a panic attack in the car. We talked about it and we are all good., but I’m dreading the convo with my MIL.

What do I say to her?

Edited to add: my husband didn’t know my reasons before the car ride and after I told him, he said he understands. He’s on my side and what I want that’s he wants. He’s not the problem here...like at all. He was thinking that it was a common thing to invite your family after the baby is born. We just didn’t talk about it and I assume he knew what I wanted.",JUSTNOMIL
"I've posted here before about my boundary invading JNMIL. She definitely isn't as bad as many of the stories on here, but it's still just hard to deal with her and the lack of communication and confrontation is hard for me (having grown up in a very healthy family with great communication). So here is the story from when my kid was born. We told them about being pregnant and JNMIL was over the moon. I think she loves babies because they don't care about boundaries until they get older. Anyways she knew she wasn't going to be in the delivery room, honestly I only wanted my husband there even though my mom was a NICU nurse back in the day. She stayed in the room until it was pushing time (I wanted someone there to listen to baby heartbeats and in case anything went south quickly). So baby is born, we hang out in L&amp;D for a bit and then get moved to the postpartum floor. Everyone comes and meets the new baby, everything is good. Now here is the thing. When we go home the next day, my parents were staying at my house, watching our pets and the plan was for my mom to start for around a week. She was basically the lone bit of sanity in our sleep deprived states, taking baby after he was changed and fed into her room to help get him back to sleep. Forever grateful for that. Anyways, back to the JNMIL, and maybe the first instance where I noticed it. They were going to come over after we got home from the hospital. But then it was late, and they had dinner, and something Rose that I don't remember. Finally they come over around 8pm and basically just hang out for 2 hours holding my new baby. They stayed until 10pm, the day I was released from the hospital! I'm of course exhausted, but thinking they won't stay long and up to this point MIL had been a generally nice person. I was a little delirious, but my dad was pissed. He came up and made a big deal about me and baby should probably go to sleep and visiting hours were drawing to and end. They left. They didn't even think to bring a meal to the new parents, or volunteer to do dishes or anything. Just came to see baby. This was just the beginning of the crazy and she continues today. And here is where I would like some advice... I'm pregnant again and really don't have any desire to include her in this. I would almost just do a Facebook post and let her find out that way, but I think my husband would find that kinda mean. He still thinks she means well, and I've slowly pointed him to ""this is not normal behavior"". He gets it but still wants to be on food terms with his mom. Idk what exactly to do, other than let him text her the news at some point.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hello all! I'm a regular on the sub in the comments, this new account was created for posting purposes here.

My husband and I have been married for well over the 12 year mark. We're both nerdy types with scientific backgrounds and hobbies in artistic ventures. Both of our families have a similar educational background as well - my husband has a Ph D in Physics, as does his uncle. His father is a mathematician. Much of his and my extended family are joyful fun loving people. 

My husband's mother unfortunately follows the beat of her own drum. The plain fact is she cannot understand sarcasm and has a slightly lower than average intelligence in most day to day matters. I'd like it to be stated: I have no problem with this. There are limits to the genius brain, it's not all it's cracked up to be. There are so many more important parts of an individual's personality: caring, compassion, general outlook, willingness to give of oneself.   

The fact is she's coupled as such with low self esteem, anger, and great disdain for her family members. Despite my husband's impressive accomplishments she ridicules his intelligence and achievements, makes cruel comments regarding his weight and appearance. This emotional abuse has resulted in anxiety and what I'm sure will be diagnosed as PTSD. In every situation she is sure she has the ideal solution you either will not listen to her, don't care about her opinion, or it's not really that bad. Her complete lack of filter is alienating close and extended family alike.

Her ideal form of conversation: you talk and she's always guaranteed to ask lots if questions, you know - she likes to be engaging. However the only caveat is that all questions are in the format of a single word:  ""Why?"" Should you ask her to elaborate you will be gifted with a ""Well why?"" The Mrs does have a bachelor's degree and is very talented. I am however certain that this conversation tactic is integral to the fact that she has not once been hired in her field. 

Mrs Cockblockerson, like many of her kind, thrives on creating chaos within peace. Spending 45 minutes deciding upon the seating for an hour long drive while also ensuring I'm not sitting next to the nephew who has requested to sit next to me. Stealthily asking said nephew to walk up to me with sad pouty eyes to ask ""Aunty will you please come for Christmas too?"" when the Mrs has already been informed no we unfortunately cannot because others in the office deserve a holiday too. Someone must remain to hold down the proverbial fort. As though him asking directly would be the catalyst for our change of heart. The cruelty to get his hopes up as well.

She also likes to ""find"" something we've ""left in the house"" just as we're about to pull out of the driveway. In a predictable dramatic fashion the Mrs will come running out of the house arms flailing in the air and shouting. Now her normal every day indoor voice is a booming shout with a slight hillbilly accent. She'll use terms like ""I don't rightly know as I've heard that"" and the three combined make me struggle to keep a straight face. Especially considering the visual of her perpetual squinty scowl and pursed lips. 

Anyway...The Mrs was running out of the house wailing, screaming and shaking her arms in the air like she ^really ^^really ^^^really did care. What was all the fuss?  [A protein shaker mixing ball!](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61zd95hc5jL._SY355_.jpg) It's always a protein shaker mixing ball. We're not always drinking protein shakes when we visit and shaker balls are now eclipsing bottles by quite a margin.

One visit just before my husband and I were married the Mrs had asked for dinner suggestions. I suggested enchaladas with mild red sauce. My husband and FIL have GI problems but eat spicy food, everyone else I knew loved enchiladas. Mrs Cockblockerson's reply was that they ""didn't do much for fancy sauces in their house"". FIL suggested a steakhouse to keep the peace and we went. The next night dinner was leftovers. The Mrs had heated her food up wan was getting comfy in front of the rabbit ears in a recliner when she exclaimed ""Oh rats!"" and jumped up into the kitchen. She then spent a few minutes at the stove separating eggs, whisking water and lemon juice over a flame, turned off the heat whisked in butter and seasoned to taste. 

Yes you read that correctly. The woman who ""didn't do much for fancy sauces in her house"" just whipped up the mother of all ""fancy sauces"" during a commercial break for her doggie bag of leftover asparagus. Clearly she's never read anything written by Harper Lee.

In the past she has had a perverse need to make sure none of her married children shared a bed with their spouse (bonus points if they can't share a room!)... Which is where her name originates. Mrs. Cockblockerson made it her mission to keep her sons as physically far from their wives as possibly, including attempting to use other family members to split rooms at a resort. God forbid anyone get laid. She's one of the only MIL's to actively not want grandchildren. 

Now that she's finished making the holidays exxxtra fun lets move on to present day. My nephew is having a minor surgery. It's not a huge deal, but a child having surgery is stressful enough. Moreso for the kiddo! My nephew specifically asked me to be there. I love the little man dearly so my husband and I had intended upon driving up the weekend before and I would tentatively fly back. My husband had a work emergency so we'll both be heading down later.

No problem, I'm disabled so I have all of the time in the world. My nephew is a priority to us so flights and hotels are being booked, everything is good.

While I'm working on bookings my husband calls his parents who live in the same town to go over plans and let them know we'll be back up probably a month later. Everything is coming together smoothly, no worries. 

But that's never good enough for my MIL, Mrs Cockblockerson, who decides to tell my husband that his surgery may not be the day his parents have given me because ""they're not always done the day they're scheduled"".

*Record Scratch *

Queue to me trying for a day and a half to get a hold of my brother and sister in law to confirm dates. Hoping that flights won't go up too much. That my hotel will still have accessible rooms available. Trying not to argue with my grouchy overworked husband about whether or not his mother did this because she was trying to be helpful, trying to cause a disruption, or keep me from my nephew who she gets more time with. I'm happy she has a good relationship with him. I'm not happy she's taking out her very grown up issues on a child. 

Once things were sorted I messaged Brother and Sister in law that I ""didn't want to embarrass her so I guess we just won't mention it 😂"".

My husband thinks there is a logical conclusion- she must have gotten confused but was just trying to help. I understand that it must be difficult if your mother is constantly slinging mud. But I'm tired of her behavior and I am just done with it. I'll be on my best behavior this trip, but then I'm back to ignoring then shutting down the games...

And... I wasn't able to post before leaving. Surgery went without a hitch and MIL was actually polite for the most part. The surgeon's office had rescheduled nephew's procedure later in the day, but the date was never in question. I have no idea what happened. 

I had to use my wheelchair for the majority of the trip and needed FIL or BIL to actually push me in parking lots or long distances so I'm wondering how much this impacted her behavior. 

We're both visiting next month so we'll see what happens then.

"So, I’m back home from visiting my best friend. I’m sad and miss her lots but I’ll be able to see her soon.

Dad picked me up from the airport and was very excited to see me. I told him everything I did (including edibles for the first time) and he laughed. He was very chill. He asked to see my tongue piercing so I showed him and he said, “So that’s what your mom is complaining about?”

Got home, mom was happy to see me and hugged me. We talked for a bit and she didn’t bring up the tongue piercing. She asked to see my nip piercings so I showed her and she said, “Oh, I thought they were going to be big. Like, big long ones. Those are small. They look good”. The look on my face, y’all... Not a bad thing, but I was shocked. She eventually noticed the way I was talking and straight up asked, “Did you get your tongue pierced?” I made a face and went “noooooooo” and she asked me to show her so I did. She made a face and a sound of disapproval and that was it.

My beloved Mr. Snuggles immediately perked up when I came into the house and he kissed me 😭 I was blessed. He followed me around and kept asking for pets.

I’m surprised my mom was so chill. She made it seem like such a big deal and now she’s like, “Okay. Whatever”, even stating she likes my nipple piercings. I’m not complaining, but wat.

Oh well. Good to know I’m not going to get shit on. For now, at least.",JUSTNOMIL
"Just what it sounds like. I (M-26) am getting married to my fiance (M-28).

We are getting married in two weeks. It's been four years and we are so ready to get on with it. My parents are supportive and will attend. My Dad went through grieving processes over the last four years, but he is being supportive and will be there.

My future in-laws are very evangelical and not supportive at all. My future father-in-law is more supportive than my future MIL, but she runs the house and what she says goes. I have taken an effort to get to know them and they are very kind and cordial in person. We've had several dinners together, with my fiance and by myself, and if it's been a bit awkward, no knock-down drag-outs have taken place.

FMIL has not responded with her RSVP yet, and we take that to mean a tacet no.

Even if they are not supportive and still show up, it would show a lot of solidarity and they can be visible while still acknowledging they have much to work on when it comes to our relationship.

 If they are not supportive and decide not to show, however, I feel like their absence would be a massive elephant in the room and deeply hurtful to my fiance. I have let him handle this part of it, and he has been thankful I have. That said, I start to wonder if I should be more vocal and reaching out/expressing what my fiance has not yet. I fear that my future in-laws don't know how hurtful not attending would be, and my fiance is afraid to express that to them. In private, his anger is a righteous one and he even brings up excluding my future in-laws in raising grandchildren, etc. 

I fear my window is closing to reach out and try to change their minds. Should I do this and express our hope that they attend, or stay out of it? I am leaning towards not intervening - but I am also aware of the deep pain this would bring to the man I love so early into our marriage.

"Tried to get ahold of her all of yesterday. 3 calls and 5 messages ignored.

"TLDR below

Some may have seen [my earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/bsea7i/biomom_broke_into_our_house_while_i_was_sleeping/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) wherein my fiancé’s biological mother who abandoned him as a kid then resurfaced his senior year of high school, broke into my house while I was sleeping in an attempt to sabotage our relationship. 

My FH was away and as soon as we realized what exactly had happened he had me come up to stay with him where he was for the remainder of the trip. 

We returned home tonight to find biomom sitting on our porch. No clue if she somehow found out when we were coming back or if she’d just been sitting there indefinitely. We’re in the process of checking our home and computers for bugs or surveillance software. 

First she just bluntly said “my key didn’t work.” To which FH replies “I never gave you a key.” And she knew she was caught. 

She started breaking down with some dramatic problem I’m pretty sure she made up, using it as a reason to say she didn’t have a place to stay. 

FH said in no uncertain terms her previous behavior was totally unacceptable and if she valued her relationship with him she’d pick up her things, leave, and not call us unless he reached out to her. 

He physically got between us so I could go in the house without having to confront her. I begged him not to engage with her and just come inside but he’s a mediator and problem solver by nature and it just didn’t click for him that this, or any thing,  couldn’t be solved with calm rational discussion. 

I could hear most of what he was saying from inside in between her hyena banshee shrieking of “WHY DON’T YOU LOVE ME” “WHY DON’T YOU CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO ME” “WHAT DID I EVER DO TO DESERVE THIS TREATMENT” “WHY CAN’T YOU BE LIKE OTHER SONS THAT LOVE THEIR MOTHERS UNCONDITIONALLY” etc. (that one really hurt him.) 

FH was very calmly but firmly saying things like “What you did was a violation of our trust.” “You have to show me and BoughtHaven respect if you want it to be reciprocated.” “I told you, [you staying here overnight] isn’t something we’re comfortable with considering your past behavior.” 

I was actually shocked at how composed he was. Then she repeated her favorite time tested line for all women he speaks with besides her “WHO’S THE MORE IMPORTANT WOMAN IN YOUR LIFE?? ME OR HER??” And he used a reply he got in therapy “It doesn’t have to be a choice unless you make it one.” To which she yelled “DON’T YOU CONDESCEND TO ME”
And tried to smack him. 

Being well over a foot taller than she is it didn’t take much for him to grab her wrist before she could, (big improvement because in the past he wouldn’t have tried to stop her, assuming he must deserve it) the screaming only intensified. “YOU’RE ASSAULTING ME. ASSAULT. HOW COULD YOU PUT HANDS ON YOUR OWN MOTHER” I didn’t see this happen but FH described it to me and I’d later see a playback of it. 

At that point he said the discussion wasn’t going anywhere and she needed to leave our property for the time being. He went inside. 

He locked the door and asked if I was ok and I nodded and he just said “ok, good.” I asked if he was ok and he just sat down on the floor and started *bawling.* 

He didn’t say much besides whispering a couple times, more to himself than anyone else “Why does she do this?” 

I couldn’t imagine how I’d feel if anyone I was related to put on half the display she just had, and was frankly a bit overwhelmed myself but not nearly as much as he was obviously, so I just got on the floor and sat with him for a while. Then, lo and behold, who was staring at us through the side window? Yep. 

I put down all the curtains and FH said (I’m paraphrasing here) “I know you’re caught in the crossfire of baggage I came to you already carrying. I should be the one to fix this. But I can’t. As much as I hate her, I love her and I don’t know what to do right now and I’m so sorry to ask you but can you deal with this? If I try I’ll make a wrong choice and if we do nothing it won’t stop.” 

So I told him I was going to call the cops and have her charged for trespassing. He said he’d stand behind whatever I decided he just couldn’t be the one pulling the trigger. 

Called the cops and said there was a woman outside screaming and trespassing on our property after we’d told her to leave. While I was on the phone with them FH’s phone was blowing up. Texts, calls, but not from Biomom, from our across the street neighbor. 

I was worried Biomom had intentionally hurt herself on our property and the neighbors were calling to alert us, or hoping she’d woken them up and I could encourage them to call the cops as well, but instead apparently Biomom went knocking on our neighbors doors (mind you this was late at night) and the first person who opened the door she pleaded with them saying her son had asked her to come over and his girlfriend wasn’t letting her in and threatened her. 

More texts and calls from the neighbor that his mother was there looking for him and asking if he’s ok. 

It was all too much for me at this point with the cops and Biomom and the neighbors and poor FH steeped in resurfacing childhood trauma breaking down on the living room floor. So I called his real mother. She was definitely in bed I could tell by her voice but I said “Listen we got home and ‘Biomom’ was outside and—“ I think she could also hear FH sobbing in the background because she cut me off and said “Say no more, I’m getting my keys.” 

Stepmom/real mom was there before the cops even got there. I went to open the door for her and run point on Biomom who was still stomping around our front door. Stepmom was a few feet away from the door when Biomom yelled “GO AWAY AND STOP TEARING MY FAMILY APART. I AM HANDLING THIS. HIS MOMMY IS HERE HE DOESN’T NEED ANYONE ELSE.” 

Now a bit of context — Stepmom is a jovial office worker, the kind who always wears lapel pins and has a candy bowl on her desk. They could use her photo to sell maple syrup. She’s the most mellow and unthreatening person I’ve met, maybe ever. 

Not at that moment. 

She got this look in her eyes I’ve only ever seen maybe once or twice and screamed in a way that sounded like a demon in an exorcism movie “I’VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU. YOU’RE DONE. GO AWAY AND LEAVE MY SON ALONE.” She shoved Biomom out of the way and went inside, of course just as the cops were pulling up to witness this display. Of course their first impression just had to be that stepmom was a rage-a-holic pushing old ladies and Biomom was a scared victim being beat up on by a crazy lady in pajamas. 

She came in and I witnessed one of the most genuine and pure displays of actual mothering. She, of course, brought tissues in her purse because that’s the kind of lady she is. Wiped FH’s tears, put her hand in his and said in this warm whisper “It’s alright. You’ve done nothing wrong.” And even as a grown man of enormous stature he just melted in her little arms, it’s like you could see the tension evaporating out of him.  But that didn’t last long. 

Biodad had driven stepmom and had been talking to the cops and showing them the nest app. We had literally just gotten back so hadn’t downloaded the app or even thought about the system. It showed her getting to our house 4 hours before we got home and trying the door, the windows, it showed the whole altercation outside when we got back. 

We each gave statements to the police and apparently Biomom was, shall we say, less than cooperative after they stopped buying her victim spiel. 

The police told her to pack up her things and go to her residence. She told them she didn’t have a place to stay here, I’m sure giving them some line about her degenerate ungrateful son. They told her that wasn’t their problem and essentially “you don’t have to go home but you can’t stay here.” 

According to Biodad she said she’d go once she composed herself, but thankfully the officers remained and said they had to see her leave, right then, or she could leave with them to the police station. And if she came back to our property she would be immediately arrested. 

Apparently the neighbor she bothered volunteered statements to the cops in her favor, so I’ve got to keep an eye on them. 

I can’t even put into words how good it feels to have won this round and have us all more or less keep our cool and have her now on the radar of police and on camera. And it is such a huge step mentally for FH to not feel obligated to step in and save the day for Biomom or shield her from the consequences of her actions because he’s her son and supposed to keep anything bad from ever happening to her. I’m so proud of him. 

Our place is pretty small and I wanted to give him time to feel whatever he’s got to feel with his real mom to support him through it and biodad and I have been kicking it at his place, but we’re starting to think FH and SM fell asleep so I’m heading back soon. 

We’re giving it another 15 minutes and he needed a moment to decompress from the whole thing on his own so I’ve been typing up this whole surreal ordeal to burden you internet strangers with. It’s time for me to celebrate this victory. So, if you’ve read this far, thank you so much. And if you haven’t 

*tl;dr My fiancé and I came back to find his biological mother sitting outside our house making a scene. We tried to get her to go away. It escalated to police involvement. Our new cameras captured her entire episode and disputed her claims to cops that we had victimized her. Fiancé is a wreck but on the men’s. Besides worrying about him, I’m  on top of the world. We win this round. Finally.*

"ETA: Thank you everyone for the overwhelming validation that I'm not crazy for actually agreeing on this with my crazy Mother.

So I've been struggling with this a lot since I found out I'm pregnant (still don't know the gender for sure but I suspect Boy and it's good to be prepared either way). 

DH and I have discussed this at length and his position on it is that circumcision can be medically beneficial ie reduces risk of UTI's etc but he'll support whatever I decide. 


And I found myself quoting TROC about how circumcision is only required if you decide to raise the boy Jewish...and I felt a bit sick and sad hearing myself say that. (I think DH could tell I'd hit a mental wall of some kind and said he'd support my decision either way) and I know that circumcision also ""reduces genital sensitivity"" in boys but my DH has never had any problems in that regard lol. So now I'm just feeling lost. 


My DH is agnostic at most and I'm Pagan, so religion doesn't factor into it. Even if DH was raised catholic and I was raised Jewish/non-denominational, we'll let our child(ren) decide what suits them in regards to belief systems. And I don't even know how I'd start teaching a boy the intricacies of washing under the foreskin etc and DH can't help there either. I'm also worried about providing the best possible care for my baby when he or she is so vulnerable and delicate and new to this world and being extra cautious about a boy with healing genitals when we the parents inflicted the damage to his genitals in the first place almost the moment he enters this world has me all tied up in knots of guilt and indecision for a choice I haven't even made yet. 

DH seems to be more in favor of circumcision and I'm honestly starting to think I'm being ridiculous for agonizing over this. My DH has always been my voice of reason but I can't get her stupid anti circumcision propaganda out of my head.

"I call her Satan. Ive posted about her before on here. Y'all validated my thoughts and helped me feel like she is the crazy one and I'm not, so thank you. 

Today I had to tell everyone about what happened this weekend. We are less than a week away from her 4th wedding. She hasn't shared many details about the day of the wedding.  I believe she just assumed we would know them, because that's plausible. 

Satan called Saturday to talk details. (exactly one week out and she wants to clue my DH in on the deets.) We are usually pretty busy people on the weekends. April - June the last several years is always booked with family or weddings or going on vacations. DH has a work event the evening before her wedding and a friend moving across the country on the day after. we weren't told this was some big hoopdie do, in fact she said it would a very small thing. only close family will be at the ceremony. reception is at someone's house. its also #4. so we felt ok only being there day of.

NOPE

She wanted the entire weekend. 

He explained what we have going on and she was upset because she wanted him there for this and that. well she never mentioned any of this stuff. the last time I saw her she talked about what she was wearing, decor, and couldn't stop gushing about the church.(its old) that's all she would give for details. 

well now that DH wont be there shes guilting him and making him feel bad. he told her if she would have let him know these things he could have planned to be there but this was the first he was hearing of it. She just assumed we would be there the entire weekend. She assumed he knew he was walking her down the aisle. She is so busy assuming we know details that now shes upset we don't know any details.

Then I get dragged into the fold. In my last post I talked about how she invited me to a ""girls night"" the night before the wedding. I was not going. 1. She invited me by calling me the wrong name. 2. I have dog that's psycho around living humans and would have to be boarded. The following weekend hes going to be boarded for 9 days while we go on vacation.Not paying for that and i'm not subjecting him to that when its unnecessary. ( should also mention this vacation and boarding have been in the books since before she met the guy shes marrying, my vacation plans come first)

She tells DH that she ""had to cancel her girls night because so many people were busy and backing out"" then she throws in there that she never heard anything from me (she never called). sneaky DH knew she was supposed to call me but rather than giving me the heads up just wanted to let it happen. See what I would do but had a hunch that she would never make the call. She didn't, but some how because she didn't call me she tried turning it around to him about how I never called her, so he actually corrected her and asked her if she did in fact make the phone call, she said no. she went on to whine about how she thought I would call her after we got home to schedule it and blah blah blah. HA NOT WORKING ON ME. You will not get any sympathy from me. IDGAF. Maybe Elizabeth will lend you a shoulder to cry on but it wont be sameatswaffles. 

I'm irritated at this whole mess for how upset my DH gets. it doesn't seem fair that she can go weeks without any information then just expect us to know whats going on. 

 I guess that's what you get when you have a person with Narcissistic Personality Disorder. she wont take responsibility for any of the problems that arise, its always someone else's fault.",JUSTNOMIL

This is about the time she tried to deny a time I was sexually assaulted because I didn't tell her right after it happened as a child.

I was sexually assaulted as a child, multiple times, by the kids who lived next door to me (brother and sister). She knows about that, and a police report was filed and I was given an interview for that. I remember a police officer asking me if I knew what a penis was, I was just confused and wanted it to stop. Never received any sort of therapy or counseling for that, btw, or any sort of mental health check. Well, the neighbor kids weren't the only ones who did. There was a pair of boys, between 10 and 13, who lived up the street. Long story short, they assaulted me too, laughed about my reaction, and left. I never told my mom, because I was scared she wouldn't believe me, and because they had threatened to kill my dog if they found out I told anyone.

Flash forward roughly ten years. I start to remember it after having blocked it out for years, and I decided to bring it up to her. SHE GETS MAD THAT I DIDN'T TELL HER ABOUT THAT INCIDENT SOONER. She starts berating me for not telling her sooner, that maybe it was just the neighbor kids (I remember very clearly that they weren't, however the neighbor boy was there and was the one who told them they could ""use"" me), and then insinuated I was making it up to get her attention. Then she flat out said it didn't happen, and it must've just been a nightmare form the earlier assaults. I just stopped talking to her and went to my room. She then forced her way into my room to ask me what was wrong and then demanded that I tell her what was wrong when I didn't say anything. 

She does this thing where she'll make me feel like shit to break me down, and then ""make up"" with me to bring me back under her control while I'm weak. It's something she's been doing since I was a child. She often does this by talking about how hard it was for her as a kid, and how she didn't want that kind of life for me, that she loves me SO much, and that she doesn't want me to end up just like her. This usually happens when we cleaned, because cleaning brings out emotions for her, I guess???

And then she does that. She plops herself on my floor, and just starts talking, and I can't escape it, I just want to be left alone and say that. She glares at me, says she'll ignore what I said, and before I know it I'm back to not being mad at her and feeling sorry for her that she's had it so rough. Not to say she hasn't, but she definitely uses it/used it to get me back under her thumb.

Then just like that she rugswept me talking about another instance of me being sexually assaulted as a child because it made her feel like a bad parent. She doesn't like anything that makes her feel less than a ""good parent"". If anything does, she had a tendency to lash out, and then cue the whole ""let me tell you how rough I had it"" spiel. Tell her I was sexually assaulted, again, as a child, definitely fits the bill. 

Sometimes she'll reference it when she's trying to make a point about me being dramatic, or is accusing me of lying. No one else knows she is, because she is very good at doing it subtly. If I try to confront her about it, she just tries to gaslight me into submission. Trying to do it in front of people leads to honeyed words laced with poison so they can't tell, and then a huge fight later. She'll beak out the ""you made me feel like a bad parent!"" card and then it turns into me comforting her while she tells me all about how rough her childhood was, and how she didn't really have much of a childhood after he parents split. 

&amp;#x200B;

This shows how much she hates feeling like a ""bad parent"", and the lengths she'll got to convince herself she's a ""good parent"". If I dare bring up anything to her about her past actions, she'll say I'm accusing her of being a bad parent, when I'm ""just being a bad daughter ""since she's been a single parent most of her life and I need to help out more. Yeah. She wants me to help so she can ~~manipulate me  and mold me into being just like her!~~ have a ""heart to heart"" while we clean like when I was younger.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi, all! Yes, it's me again - the 49 year old F with the 72 year old Mum who still imagines she's my carer, even after everything that's happened! Anyway, this is just a quick question. You may or may not remember that Mum wanted to come to my Franciscan ""novicing"" which is on the 3rd June. I posted about it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/bq769w/mother\_wants\_to\_come\_to\_my\_novicing\_i\_wish\_id/](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/bq769w/mother_wants_to_come_to_my_novicing_i_wish_id/)

By the sounds of things, they could make things rather awkward for me because step-dad was refusing to come into the church, saying that he was just going to drop Mum off and that ""they"" (mean the Franciscans!) could take her home! So rude. Well, as it happens, the venue has changed - it's now in our usual church, which is on my side of town. I'll still need a taxi, but it won't be so expensive and at least I'm familiar with the area. Mum &amp; step-dad haven't mentioned my novicing since that time, and Mum hasn't put it on her calendar (she puts everything on her calendar, including all my appointments!) If it's safe to assume they've forgotten, is it out of order for me not to remind them &amp; just quietly go? I'm going to ask my friend for a lift, but if she can't manage it, then a taxi it is. It will be so much more relaxing not having to worry about Mum &amp; step-dad. They may behave themselves, but they may not (I still have cold sweats remembering them both coming to the opticians with me last year - I won't go into the sordid details but suffice it to say I had to apologise to the staff for my step-dad's behaviour...one example, the lady in the optician's said to me, ""Sorry to keep you waiting!"" to which my step-dad replied (as he overheard her) ""No, you're not!!"" So embarrassing!)

So am I justified in keeping schtum about it? Doesn't sound very Christian I know! My friend says that if they were that keep to come, they wouldn't just forget &amp; would have mentioned it again by now! Of course, if Mum does say something this weekend, that's different. But is it OK to let the obligation &amp; guilt go, just this once?!",JUSTNOMIL
"This bitch. Ugh. For starters she’s my psycho ex’s mom, we broke up about 7 years ago, and my daughter was only 2 years old and not his child. 

Just going to preface by saying I don’t care about people piercing their infant’s ears. It’s not for me, my mom waited until I was old enough to decide on my own and care for them myself. I decided to do this with my own daughter. Well my psycho ex’s mom looooved my little girl and I am pretty partial to this sweet child. I never trusted his parents, never left my kids alone with them and in fact at this point in my relationship I was trying to distance myself from him with the intentions of ghosting him, he was extremely toxic and had unchecked mental issues (diagnosed bipolar) and unknown to me a rampant meth addiction. But this isn’t about him. 

His mom announced to me one day that she was going to take my daughter to get her ears pierced and it was a *crime* she hadn’t had them done yet. I laughed and said not until she wants them done. 

This bitch informs me that she was going to take my baby to the local large retail store and get them done the first time I leave her alone with my daughter! I sputtered  out “excuse me??” And she brags that she took all of her granddaughters to get their ears pierced, and her daughter pipes up that she didn’t want her girls done either but “mom did it anyway”. They all laugh until I blew up, told her I’d slap her with every sort of lawsuit I could manage if she so *dared*. I also let them know I’d take those fucking earrings out if she managed this feat. With that, and screaming a few obscenities to her, I packed up my kids and tore out of there. 

Spoiler, my girl is 10 and still doesn’t have her ears pierced. I haven’t seen any of those crazy people since the earring debacle.",JUSTNOMIL
"Long time lurker, first time poster. The just no mil is my mother. We’ve never really gotten along great. My dad is a great enabler for her. Always excusing her behaviour, trying to make things right between us. Ignoring my feelings in order to make us a “happy family” 

My mother never really like my relationship with my fiancée. Last August I spoke of my plans after I finished my degree, and she told me she didn’t want to hear about them unless it was me going to medical school. I’ve been LC since then. Then I got engaged. I got a lukewarm “congrats” from her over the phone, which was on speaker phone because I was speaking with my father. I haven’t spoken to her since. We coexisted in the same house for a few hours on Christmas and that’s it. NC since then. 

I text my dad every so often,  but I keep my distance because he always wants us together as a family. He asked me over to the house for my moms birthday. I claimed I was working. He asked for a phone call and I didn’t call.  

Today I get this text 
“Can I ask what’s going on.   Busy as you are could you have found a few minutes to call mom on Mother’s Day and her birthday.  I don’t know what to make of it. “ 


I don’t know how to respond. I don’t know a solution to this that will salvage our relationship while explaining to him I want nothing to do with my mother. She hasn’t reached out to talk to me at all in our LC/NC time. She’s never apologized to me, ever, of her own volition for the fucked shit she’s done to me over my entire life. My life is better without her. 

How do I deal with this?

Edit ; thank each and every one of you for your advice. I read each reply and kept all your advice in mind when sending a response. 
Here’s what I sent ; 

Hello Dad,
My relationship between me and mum is between me and mum. I know you love us both, but you are mainly hearing one side of things. My conversations with mum often leave me feeling hurt and disappointed. It is best for me and my mental health to keep contact to a minimum. I’m not trying to meddle in your relationship with mum by making you responsible for something she and I need to work out. If mum wants to talk to me she knows how to get in touch with me. 

I want to stress that I will not further discuss this situation with you. Please respect me and my boundaries. 
For the time being, please do not visit me at my workplace or home. 

If you would like to communicate with me in regards to our relationship, please email me at [blank]. 

I love you very much

"We had a cookout yesterday for my hubby’s birthday, which always happens around Memorial Day, so it’s a bit of a tradition. Anyway, this year, it was my dad, as well as my in-laws (mil, fil, bil, and nephew) and we had the cookout at mil’s house. Small backstory, my mom passed away last year and I’ve been actively making sure my dad is included in things, but he’s a bit narcissistic, but just annoyingly so. He’s talking about travel plans he has, and all is going ok, with some private eye-rolling. After he left, we are sitting on the porch while kids play, and I happen to glance down when my mil’s phone flashed on. I see her texts, and happen to notice my name mentioned, so Of course, I get nosey. She (mil) is complaining to a friend about how my dad is “blowing money” which isn’t so far off the mark, but then she goes on to say “and then, there’s ‘my name’”. She’s the kind of person that talks about people behind their back, but I guess I’d deluded myself into thinking I hadn’t given her anything to bitch about with me. I am torn between asking her what she meant, and admitting that I accidentally glanced at a text, or just avoiding her. If she can’t stand me being around, I’m more than happy to relieve her of that hardship.",JUSTNOMIL
"Y’all. She’s done this before when I travel. “Tell me your itinerary and let me know when you land and when you get to x”. It’s crazy. 

If you guessed that I’m over 18 and haven’t lived with my parents in about 10 years and haven’t lived in the same state as them for about that long you are correct.  This might be some BEC things but it just drives me crazy. It’s not even a hey we’d love for you to let us know you get to x safely since you’re flying all over the country, please and thank you. It’s just you need to check in with me. The last time she did this I didn’t speak to her for a month. 

This time she told me to check in with her when I got to the hotel for, wait for it, my honeymoon. That’s right, my mother thinks I’m going to check in with her while I’m on my honeymoon. It’s not like me getting married was the first time I’ve moved out of their house and she’s all worried and it’s a hard change. She just thinks I need to let her know where I’m at and what I’m doing even if I’m on my honeymoon. 

Just. No. 

I needed to get that off my chest.",JUSTNOMIL
"I moved 45 minutes from my mom after my son was born because I can’t take the aggravation she causes but she’s still at all family events, so I deal. I posted before about her giving him Dr Pepper at 6 months and other such boundary stomping. Normally I just take him back or ignore it because it’s not worth the scene she’ll cause. Yesterday I finally put her in her place and it felt good.

She had an audience so of course she was at maximum obnoxiousness during a birthday party/ Memorial Day picnic. Every time I left the room she would start talking shit on what I feed my son. “I can’t believe they’re feeding him meat already! Did you see she gave him SPAGHETTI?” He’s 10 month old and eats a fair amount of table food, this is apparently unacceptable. 

I know this because the moron didn’t notice my husband lurking in the corner or anticipate my cousins like me and tell me this shit. She tried to tell my husband how spicy spaghetti is (she’s obsessed with bitching about this. I realize tomatoes are acidic but he likes the noodles and it’s never bothered him). I walked in to my cousins correcting her and starting to make fun of her. Ha, bitch.

She got pissy and took my son down to the pool area. Whatever, I see her trying to act like World’s Best Grandma in front of my aunt who is awesome who I trust way more than my mom. 

This is where we hit my limit on bullshit. Mom yells up to ask if they can put him in the pool. No. All I should have to say, right? Haaaaa.

She of course starts arguing, from across the party. A family friend literally yelled at her “No! No means no!” Bless him. I sit down and she says to come take pictures.

I walk down to snap a shot of him lounging by the pool. These inconsiderate assholes are putting my baby into a swim diaper. I froze, I was angry and shocked and done. I try to quietly say essentially, what the fuck? 

She of course wants to argue in front of family, friends and a bunch of kids. 

“Why can’t he go in? What’s your reasoning for that?”

Everything goes through my head. Neither of these idiots have a swimsuit on, who’s going to watch the baby? There’s already about ten kids fighting and splashing. If he’s so hot that he needs to be in the water, why do you have him in the sun? He’s never been in the water like that before, it made me uncomfortable and maybe, just maybe, I would like to take MY son swimming for the first time when I’m ready for it.

Instead I just say because I said so, I don’t need a reason I’m his mom. Deep, sulking CBF the rest of the short time we were there.

She wonders why she’s babysat once in the 10 months he’s been alive. I’m done being talked over and steamrolled so I don’t have to deal with her acting like a child. I found my voice, I’m proud that I set a boundary and put her in her place. Now I just have to keep up that energy. I’m the mom, hear me roar.

Edit: Just wanted to add a HUGE thank you to everyone who posts and comments on this sub! Because of you I shined my spine and knew what to say instead of freezing like I normally do.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hello I'm super new just found this sub and I really need some advice.

Just for a little backround, my boyfriend of 9 going on 10 years. She hates my guts, she has said some crewel things like when me and bf were watching clock work orange and there was a ""rape"" scene and I was um you know you. She didnt like that we were watching it and turned it off threw the DVD at me saying "" I thought you were raped why are you watching this"". And if anyone doesnt know they dont show it, its one of my bfs favorite movies so I baught him the DVD. 

She wouldn't let me were black or any dark color to my bfs brothers wedding even though there was no dress code. I have texts of her saying it's not appropriate or whatever but pics of other people at said wedding wearing black. 

2 weeks before the wedding my bf and I got into an accident and I injured my leg and I wore black sneakers to the stormy wet beach wedding. She called me a coward until I showed her my bruised foot. 

That whole side hates me, durring the wedding only the grandmother was nice to me. My bf was the best man, but his brother and the bride pushed me out of everything. Which I get, I'm a freak and they wanted a normal party. I'm used to being outed. 

But we got an apartment and she doesnt like my sisters who live with us. She keeps telling people my mom gave my sister autism. I dont want her coming anywhere near our apartment but she said shes coming next month. 

Should I visit and try to be civil like I have so many times or just call the police?? Anything would help and thank you for reading all of that.",JUSTNOMIL
"So I've mentioned my maternal grandmother, Toddels mom, before. She was the one who kept pinching my ass at Thanksgiving. We're typically pretty close. She has some JN tendencies but I'm much better at shutting her down and establishing boundaries than I am with either of my parents so it typically works out.

There are things she's done that kinda irk me, like posting a meme on my page that says ""hugging is the most beautiful form of communication that allows the other person to know being a doubt they matter."" Seems nice but it's a jab at the fact that I'm not a hugger. She hates it and is always trying to force me to hug her, I think I mentioned she tried to decree that I would just have to get over it because I was going to have to hug all my guests at my wedding. 

On to what is bothering me, my birthday was over the weekend. I love my birthday, everyone knows this. Not one of my grandparents called me on my birthday to wish me a happy birthday, they made Facebook posts but no calls. We always call in our family. It's just something we do. I was kind of hurt by it. Well today she messages me and says, ""I'm sorry I didn't call you for your birthday. No excuse I just kept saying I'd call later then I just forgot! You know I am old now!!!! Lol""

"Yesterday my husband and I went over to his parents house for memorial day. NMIL was there with also husbands 2 nsisters and their families. For years, husband and I have been talking about deciding on a boundary that we decided to tell his side of the family: No gifts. Except for a $5 gift exchange we all do for Christmas. No birthday gifts towards anyone, no Christmas gifts, no Mother's day gifts. No gifts.

We decided to do this boundary because tbh I kept on getting hurt every single time I would put myself out there and purchase a gift for his 13 member family. For everything. For context, he has 3 sisters (two of which have husbands and 3+ kids each) and his nmil and dad. I have purchased Mother's Day presents, birthday presents, Christmas presents, father's day presents, presents for all their children ( We do not have any children, only 2 dogs). We have purchased pizza for nephews tball games, brought wine to every family event, I've written hand-written cards for anniversaries birthdays mothers day and just because - never once have we received a single card or a birthday present except from NMIL and one time we did receive a present for Christmas two years ago from one of his nsisters. For our wedding, I asked all 3 sisters to be my bridesmaids as I thought my relationship with them would be a long lasting friendship where we would call each other and be friends, but it was one of the worst mistakes I have made.  I gave them a huge gift when I asked them to be my bridesmaid...

&amp;#x200B;

Where I am from, if someone invites you to be in their wedding, it  is custom to purchase a gift to the couple for bridal showers, bachelorette parties, and for their wedding day. Normally, we gift a $50-$100 gift for a bridal shower, $20-$30 for a bachelorette party, and around $75-$100 (from both of us to the happy couple) on their wedding day. I know it may seem like a lot, but that was the ""norm"" for me growing up and for my friends. My husbands family grew up on a hobby farm, they were all homeschooled, and are very religious. I didn't realize how much of a custom change this would be so I was taken by surprise when for our wedding I received one $20 cake pan from my NMIL, two $20 pillows (the specific instructions in the card said - one pillow is my bridal shower present, one is for my wedding) from my NSIL, her husband, and her 3 kids. And 1 set of tupperware from my other NSIL, her husband, and her 3 kids for our wedding/bachlorette/bridal shower gift. The thing is, all of these families live in 5-6+ bedroom houses in great neighborhoods, they are general managers and engineers, they go on trips abroad every year..etc. His parents have never paid for one meal for us, we have to pay them for our gas expenses anywhere we go with them, they specifically told us to get off of their Netflix account so they would not have to pay for us to be on it, and are extremely stingy about money - but when it comes to receiving gifts, they happily say thank you, accept it, and then I end up feeling like shit because I know gift giving is about giving a gift and being happy with giving - but it is so difficult to keep up with this unfairness. 

&amp;#x200B;

 So yesterday, we took a stand, and my husband said ""we will no longer be doing gifts for everyone, only $5 christmas."" to where one of his nsisters (with 3 kids) made a smartass comment ""Oh, I see, so you don't like being thoughtful for other people. I understand."" and my husband just said ""yup"". And then the rest of the family was silent. I was in the bathroom when this happened so I did not hear it myself nor could I say anything to stick up for myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Today is my Cake Day. I made this account a year ago to repost my very first post here about my Just Maybe/No Mother after she made my wedding week a **very** frustrating experience and I realized she had been covertly treating my DH like shit. Most of those details are in my first post, but there are even more things from that time I've realized sucked a lot that I had normalized.

Things with her have been *fine.* I've been low contact (haven't visited since last June), DH has been unofficially temporarily No Contact aside from a single Thank You note. There's been lots of BEC, I've managed it with firm boundaries and grey rocking.  I like to think I've got a steady handle on her bullshit from here on out... BUT, as my new therapist has pointed out, there's still a lot of unresolved old bullshit.

I started therapy because of anxiety I *thought* was unrelated to family bullshit that has been affecting me a lot, particularly at work. My therapist, who is awesome, quickly asked about my family growing up and says that can be a source of my issues. So I told him a bit about it. And now my therapy plan going forward is focus on handling my feelings about Mother. Which is both great and sucky.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, related to my title, I've been reliving some of the shitty things Mother has done to me/siblings in therapy, so it's a lot less repressed and compartmentalized than it normally is for my daily life. And now Mother's birthday is coming up, soon. I always send cards, so today in the grocery store I was trying to pick a ""Mom Birthday"" card. Which is fucking impossible when your Mother isn't the ""Best woman you've ever met"" whose ""advice is something I can't imagine living without."" I need something more like *""Without you, I wouldn't be alive. Sometimes you're cool and I appreciate that. Happy Birthday.""*

 

**Here's where I need advice:**  Dad messaged me last night and asked if we could visit around Mother's birthday. He even offered to pay for an AirBnB for us since he knows we both get overwhelmed staying at their house, especially with Mother's fosters from her 'emu' rescue. As I mentioned above, we haven't visited in nearly a year, DH has not been home when they've stopped by here in several months, Dad can tell there is a lot of intentional distance and I think he's trying to fix it without acknowledging it. 

I have lots of good excuses for why we can't go; we had to travel for surgery earlier this month so money is tight and time off is tight for DH, etc. But the real primary reason we aren't going to go is that we don't want to. Should I jade with the valid logistical excuses and just grey\_rock any alternatives they offer to get around them? Do I just not offer any reasoning and tell them we can't go? I'm not emotionally ready for the blow-up of saying something so direct as ""No because we don't want to see you/Mother.""

I will be talking to my therapist about this tomorrow, but I know y'all are very experienced with this, probably more than my therapist given that he wasn't familiar with the term 'rugsweeping' and commented on me using it regarding Mother.",JUSTNOMIL
"So MIL recently broke her pinky (I believe) and here’s the story of how it really happened 

Yesterday, as usual, she started drinking in the morning. She was, once again drunk by noon but kept drinking. 

She went out to run some errands (with her car, idiot) and came home later in the evening. 

Well she had gotten so drunk she couldn’t manage the four steps that lead to the house’s entrance and fell. And broke her finger. She now has an over the top bandage that cover her whole hand as well as her wrist.  

I cannot wait to hear whats story she’s gonna make up to explain her injury next time i see her.  

She still needs a nickname, I would suggest drunkIdiot but it doesn’t seem original enough",JUSTNOMIL
"every significant other i've had has had a weirdly close relationship with their mothers. my first serious relationship, i moved in with him and his mother while i was still in high school. she walked in after we had just finished having sex, him still naked on the bed, and neither of them acted surprised. she didn't avert her eyes and he didn't make an attempt to cover up. there were other things that made me feel strange about how she viewed him too, like how she would treat him like her caregiver. this woman was 52 at the time and had some characteristics that i can only describe as nightmarish.

my second relationship was worse. his mother lived across the country and still meddled in our business, trying to get his ex to take him back so he wouldn't be with me anymore. but she didn't really know anything about me, only what her son would tell her, and he must have gotten his phobia of taking any blame when he does something wrong from her because she fed his ego so much with ""my poor baby""s and ""i can't believe that bitch did that to you"" - when i was the one getting beaten by him. i only met this woman twice in person, both times were insane, from her saying i couldn't drink alcohol during our family outing to her accusing me of lying about a rape that had happened only a few months earlier, saying i was ""confused"". she is a rape victim herself and still said that to my face. i honestly whipped a tissue box at her head with such a force, and she cried and threatened to call the cops but my ex said she couldn't because he sold drugs :') 

the next relationship i had was brief, and his mom had passed away before we ever met. still, she had this hold on the guy that was uncomfortable at best. he told me himself he slept with her every night up until we was 14 or so, and he also admitted to having a MILF fetish. based on my history with the...intimacy...between my partners and their mothers, this waved all sorts of red flags. i abandoned ship quickly (for a lot of reasons, but that was a big one.)

now i'm with my girlfriend! her mom is a batshit bible banger, and therefore still thinks of my transitioning gf as her ""baby boy"". i recently found out she has been suggesting to gf that we break up, when i thought we all got along very well despite her delusions. we were living with her for several months so i did my best to show respect even when i disagreed with her. even when she stole and donated some of my books because they were ""evil"" (one was a wiccan guide and the other was a grimoire for green witchcraft - both very peaceful practices). even before finding out her true feelings for me, there were things about her that were simply off. she was very concerned with my gf and her plans to get bottom surgery. ""are you going to keep [your penis]? because that's really important for a woman's needs!"" gesturing to me but i had a feeling she was talking about her. 🧐 gf has also had flashbacks that make her wonder if her mother ever was inappropriate with her. i wouldn't put it past her.

what is it about mothers and their ""boys"" that makes them so rabid and out of pocket??? is this so common for anyone else? AITA?",JUSTNOMIL
"My FDH and I are getting married on June 15th. His parents unfortunately just went through a nasty divorce, and we think this may be the cause of this situation. My FMIL is very much a Just Yes; I adore her and her ex-husband is an asshole who up and left her for no reason. His mother, my fiancé’s grandmother, is a very self-righteous, passive-aggressive person who is very religious. She had originally asked if we had wanted her to make any food to bring to the wedding.

Today I received the following message from her on Facebook: 

“I received your invitation to your wedding, sadly I’m going to have to decline, It makes me sad to miss this special  day in your lives, however it’s a bad time of day for me to drive that distance.  I wish you the best day ever and a lifetime of happiness!❤️❤️”

I am fucking LIVID. This woman lives not even an hour and a half away, and we have driven up there for holidays countless times, even when I have worked the next day at 5 am. Apparently my fiancé’s father has not offered any driving or anything. She also does still drive herself. 

My fiancé is her only grandson. She drove herself to his sister’s wedding last year with no issues. My FMIL is beyond livid, she is stopping all communication with her. I am angry and hurt for my fiancé, he has done NOTHING to deserve his own grandmother not attending his wedding. This isn’t some random party or even a holiday, this is her ONLY GRANDSON’S WEDDING. I just don’t even know what to say. I am so pissed off.

Sorry for the rant, I had to get this out. I don’t understand how she thinks this is acceptable.

"I posted this in [r/relationship\_advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/) and was told this sub would be a better fit, so here it goes. Trigger warning for sexual abuse.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I can justify to you why I want to do this. I still haven't been able to justify it to myself, although you probably already guessed by the fact that I am writing this post that I am coming around to the idea. Everything I've been through I've normalized so much that it just doesn't seem like enough of a reason. What I do know is that every second that I am near my mother I just want to very literally die. I am certain that if I keep my relationship with her there is no way I will ever be able to lead a happy or normal life.

I'll lead with the story that changed my girlfriend's opinion of her in an instant. She sucked both my younger brother's and my penis when we were kids. I've only ever told two people this because my memories are so fuzzy that I'm not even sure if it really happened, it just brings me shivers when the few images I do recall flash before me. I've never asked my brother if he remembers it.

Other instances of sexual abuse would be when she showed herself naked to my brother just to spite him. When this happened my brother would scream for her to stop and even cry on occasion and she found it amusing that this was his reaction to something that, to her, was perfectly natural, so she kept on doing it. That's all I recall on the sexual abuse front.

Regarding emotional abuse. She loved threatening suicide. She did this so that we would get her money for alcohol somehow, usually by calling my father (they were divorced) or her family and asking. She would threaten to swallow entire jars of pills. Sometimes she would get into my bed at 3 A.M. and tell me she was ""going away"". Often police would bring her home at night saying that they had to remove her from the train tracks to let the train through. Eventually I wised up to all of this. When she threatened I would just say ""fine, do it"". Finding her passed out on the floor was a usual sight. Often times there would be no food for us to eat or clean clothes to wear.

That's a summary of the abuse and why I want to do this. When I write it all down it does seem like a lot, but in my mind it just seems normal. Like if I went with this to my family to justify my decision they would just call me a cry baby. More importantly, is it enough to warrant ruining my mother's life forever? I imagine it can't be easy to be told by your own child that they never want to see you again.

If I choose to do it I would of course face backlash from all of her family, my uncles, aunts and cousins. In truth if I do do this I want it to just be me telling her that I'll never see her again. But in reality I know I'll have to keep on justifying myself to her and her family probably for years to come. I am also torn on whether to explain to her why I feel this way or just telling her how being near her makes me feel. I lean towards the latter since it would make it quicker and I wouldn't have to sit through the judgment of how my reasons are not enough. What I am certain is that I don't want to mend my relationship with her, if I do this it's because I want her out forever. One thing that helps me feel like I don't want to mend the relationship is that, if it were anybody else who did this to me there would be no mending to do. You wouldn't want to mend a relationship with your abuser, and that's all that she is really to me now, my abuser. Whatever kind feelings that I have towards her are the guilt that I would feel for making her feel bad if I go through with this.

We still live in the same town, 15 minutes walking distance from one another. It wouldn't exactly be easy to do. But it's either this or remain suicidal for the rest of my life.

TL;DR: I want to cut all ties with my mother who abused my brother and me when we were children. It wouldn't be easy, we still live in the same town. I would also have to deal with all the backlash from my maternal family. Should I do it and if so how?",JUSTNOMIL
"I’m not sure if this even deserves a post, many people on here have much, much, much more serious IL problems, but it’s a strange situation for me and I wonder if anyone has been in a similar place before. 

See BB for more detailed posts about MIL but to sum it up, she has never showed any real interest in me and has been rude and PA for the past five years I’ve been with DH and ramped up the PA, snide comments, and dismissive attitude towards me after we got engaged. I went LC after an especially uncomfortable visit in February and dropped the rope, stopped trying to make her like me and just stepped back emotionally. DH told MIL that she’s never been very welcoming and used specific examples of her rude behavior to illustrate why we think she doesn’t like me. She acted shocked and then pulled me aside the following week to say she’s sorry and doesn’t know what she did wrong. I reminded her of the examples DH already gave her and said I accepted her apology and thanked her. Of course I didn’t think that was the end of it and here we are.

She never reached out to me directly and made this dramatic “apology”, tears and all, in front of about 8 members of her extended family. She still hasn’t reached out to me but saw AIL yesterday and apparently told her that she’s still so confused over all this and is so sad and blah blah blah. AIL calls DH and says she’s “concerned” about me and wants my side of the story. We were getting ready to leave so DH brushed her off and didn’t say anything about it and I haven’t spoken to AIL.

I didn’t think things would be normal right away and took her apology with a grain of salt but I thought we might be able to visit MIL and see if her behavior improves then go from there. but she seems obsessed with the fact that she apologized or that I had an issue at all. To me, it shows that she didn’t mean it and is on a smear campaign now. She doesn’t want to move forward, and she’s angry I rocked the boat. She’s very much a Matriarch Jocasta MIL, no FIL in the picture, and DH has spent his entire life trying to not rock the boat and just give her whatever she wants.

DH is still very much under the impression that his mom can change and we just need to give her a chance (as if the past five years haven’t been enough). The entire reason he finally confronted her was because he doesn’t want me to have to be LC or NC with his family. He has these visions of grandeur where everyone gets along, his mom isn’t controlling or rude anymore, and we’re one big happy family, so he’s holding on to that still. 

I want to try for him but it seems like a huge waste of energy at this point. Talking to his mom with logic and reasoning is like talking to a brick wall. She just doesn’t get it. She doesn’t WANT to get it, yet she and others keep asking me to explain why I’m dropping the rope when DH and I already have. She’s never once said “ok, I’ll try to be nicer and more accepting.” I didn’t even WANT an apology from her necessarily. I just want to be respected going forward. Is that really so hard to grasp for her? I’m so tired of treating this 65 year old woman as if she’s a 4 year old trying to learn basic manners.

Is AIL a flying monkey? Her and I have a good relationship, we aren’t close by any means, but we have fun together at family events. She’s really the only one that’s been friendly to me of DH’s family. Should I indulge any of this and tell AIL my side of the story? What would even be the point in doing that? What I want to say is “MIL, you said you’re sorry, I said I accept, let’s move on.” Or just go NC because all of this just seems like a huge waste of time, but that feels like a very cold response and DH has told me as much. I’m not a cold person normally but when I’ve been pushed to a certain point, I tend to shut down. Just don’t know if I’m being an asshole for not extending more patience towards her for DH’s sake.

"Granny Gator is the ultimate party pooper. 



So, I’ve made a couple of posts about Granny Gator before, if you’re curious feel free to hit my profile and catch up on her level of crazy. 


To preface this story I’ll summarize my situation, my parents were drug addicts and because they were more focused on getting high than parenthood they ditched me with my grandmother literally the day I was born. My mother died shortly afterwards and my dad crawled into a meth pipe for the next 20 years. This left me with Granny Gator, which was pretty much the worst thing ever. I would have been better off with the tweakers in all honesty because Granny Gator was as crazy as a shithouse rat, and also abusive as hell in a multitude of ways. 


Her big issue was her obsessive need to control me, she framed it as love but it wasn’t love, I know that now, it was just manipulation. I was never allowed out of her sight, everything I did or said or ate or drank was scrutinized, she wouldn’t even let me sleep in my own bed until after I turned 13, and she only let me do so then because I begged. 

Around that same time she got ‘sick’ and by sick I mean she decided that she didn’t feel like adulting anymore and so she bought a hospital bed, started doctor shopping and eventually she faked her way into real health problems. She did all of this so that she could keep me at home, she’d have me fetching and carrying for her all night long even on school nights until I was so exhausted I couldn’t stay awake in class. Eventually I was ‘home schooled’ and before I graduated high school I quit entirely because I couldn’t care for her and go to school too. It was exact what she’d wanted the entire time.

I had ONE friend when I was a teenager, and  we were best friends until she died last year of a heroin overdose in connection with an assault and robbery. My grandmother despised her with every fiber of her being but S, ( my friend) was the one person she couldn’t drive off. It drove Granny Gator insane. This brings us to my 21st birthday, S had been planning a night out for us for months, we had a whole game plan for our night, S even rented us a hotel room near the club/bar we intended to go to. I’d been looking forward to it forever. My grandmother didn’t like it, but as I was 21 for the very first time I didn’t cave in to her demands and emotional manipulation. Here are a few of her favorite emotional blackmail tactics. 

“ What if I die while you’re not here? What if the house catches on fire? I can’t get out by myself, do you want me to burn up?”

“ I guess you really don’t love me anymore, you think you’re all grown up and now you’re done with me. “


“ I took you in, raised you, loved you more than life and this is how you repay me?”

“ Jesus sees your wicked heart.” 


“Why don’t you just admit you hate me? You have to, because if you loved me you wouldn’t treat me this way. “

“ This is what I get for having such a tender heart. “


“ When you come back and find me dead you only have yourself to blame!” 


The list goes on and on but those were the classics, I was seriously mentally damaged at the time from a lifetime of her mind games, it took everything I had not to cancel my plans, and so the day came and I was getting ready to leave, I was so happy and excited, I had even put on makeup for once. 



I should have known better than to think she gave up. She’d been quiet all day that day, almost nice, I should have realized it was just the calm before the shitstorm. In this case literally, because no sooner had S called and said she was on her way than Granny Gator started moaning in pain. She sounded like a dying cow, and at first I just intended to ignore it....but then it happened. 



That old witch actually intentionally shit the bed, and not a normal shit either....it looked like a poo bomb detonated in her bed, it was in her freaking HAIR. I’ve never seen that much shit come out of one human being before. It almost defied logic.  I’d always known she was full of shit but not even I realized that it was literal as well as figurative.  She made a big show of sobbing and apologizing, but we both knew she wasn’t sorry. 


.  


I had to lift her shit soaked body out of the bed and put her on the bedside toilet, strip her bed, disinfect it, make it up with fresh sheets, and then bathe her from head to toe. I smelled worse than she did by the end. S had come by that point and was waiting on me, and I fully intended to just leave with her and take a shower at the hotel....but before I could Granny Gator started moaning again. 



She did it again. She looked me right in my eyes and she shit the bed again and somehow it was even worse than before. We just looked at each other for a second, she knew she’d won, we both did. I told S that I couldn’t go with her, and that we had to cancel our plans. It would be hours before I had Granny Gator cleaned and settled again because the blanket she’d just shat on was the only clean one she had left. Same with her sheets. 


S hugged me and left, ( shit stench and all) and I set about doing everything all over again. Now that I wasn’t going anywhere, Granny Gator was content. 

I wish I had an uplifting ending for this, some sort of great payback. Unfortunately I don’t, I did everything over again, got her tucked into bed clean and dry and freshly bathed and then crawled into my own bed to cry myself to sleep 


I didn’t try going out again until after the vicious old sow died, after which I found out a LOT of information about her and her decisions, none of it good. This is the second worst thing I can remember her doing to me. 


So.  That’s my story.  Party successfully pooped.",JUSTNOMIL
"I (28F) just got off of the phone to my very JustYes Nanna(80sF) over an hour ago. Just last week, I sent her a birthday card via post, as her birthday is coming up. I put in my contact details, letting her know that if she ever needs anything or just wants to chat, I'm always here. She is aware that I'm refusing to talk to my Parents (see post history), but I have no ill feelings towards her or anyone else. 

  
Nanna is my Dad's Mum.

&amp;#x200B;

She was recently diagnosed with Dementia, and I decided to get back in touch with her and my extended family after going NC with both my Parents last September. I never thought anyone would believe my stories about my Parents, so I just focused on myself away from my Family.

&amp;#x200B;

Nanna mentioned her Dementia diagnosis to me and how she needs to find money to fund her eventual move into Aged Care. In a recent post [eDad turns out to be a JustNo Dad](https://www.reddit.com/r/Justnofil/comments/bq4cfk/dad_turns_out_to_be_a_big_justno_ndad/), I stated that my Dad (60sM) has borrowed over $100k + from Nanna over a period of a decade (and more), with no intention of paying her back. He also gets $50 per fortnight DIRECTLY into his account from her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, what Nanna said to me over the phone today has really irked me. **As it was purely about my nMum.**

&amp;#x200B;

During 2017, my Parents moved in with Nanna (I'm assuming rent free.....or at the very least, low rent) for just over a year. When they lived with her, Dad was often at work and nMum was often at home with Nanna, as Mum refused to get a job. Gosh...no wonder they were strapped for cash. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mums behaviour, according to Nanna, was weird. Mum needed to control everything around her, including her dog (who I shall rename Poppy for this post). Mum even slapped Poppy when Poppy wanted to be with Nanna. It got to the point where my Mum would lock herself, with Poppy, in the bedroom. That way Poppy would HAVE to stay with Mum. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nanna either had to walk on eggshells around Mum or let Mum do her own thing JUST to keep the peace. That's no way to live, I even told Nanna that. It's Nanna's home, she opened up HER home to my Parents. My Parents should treat her with the utmost respect. But they don't. All they want is money.

&amp;#x200B;

Now Nanna has no idea where my Parents live, as they've just recently moved. I was kinda thankful she didn't ask me, because I don't know where they live either. She also knows that my Parents lied to her on Mothers Day because they told her that ""We wont be able to see you today, OP is visiting"". Hahaha, pfft no...lies...LIES!! But she actually didn't hear the truth from me, she heard it from my Aunt. 

&amp;#x200B;

She then invited me out to Lunch next week, along with my Fiancé and Daughter. The rest of the extended Family will be there, barring my Parents. Nanna was also concerned about Mum's reaction.

  
\&gt; Nanna: What's going to happen if your Mum finds out about us having Lunch together?  
\&gt; Me: Then she finds out. No biggie lol  
\&gt; Nanna: Will she be angry or...?  
\&gt; Me: Oh yeah, she'll hate all of us....but let's do lunch anyway. We're all adults, I don't need her permission  


&amp;#x200B;

I'm doing Lunch regardless. If Mum finds out, let her get mad, at least my extended Family will support me.",JUSTNOMIL
"This is not a criticism of bridal showers, they’re just not my scene. Also, sorry for the long post, there’s a lot to sift through and this just happened. Double apologies for formatting and words, I’m sure I’ll need to edit. 


I am getting married in October to my SO of 9 years. I don’t have a lot of close female friends, FDH’s family lives 3+hours away, and I’m not an overly social person, so I was resistant to the idea of a bridal shower right off the bat. Since SO and I have been together for so long, we don’t really need much and it just seems weird to have a party I don’t want for her friends. I didn’t stick to my guns after getting a lot of advice that it would be easier to just give in and have the bridal shower, as it would distract my mother enough and get her to leave me alone. 

We went to the restaurant where she wants to hold it, it was nice, and I agreed. 

Cut to two weeks later, and I get a call from my Maid of Honor, who is also my cousin. My cousin has gone VLC with my mother, as she has a long history of undermining her as a parent, and generally just running all over her time and boundaries. My cousin is a nurse who works overnight shifts and also a single mom with two teens. Her bf lives right outside the city where we are getting married, and on the night of my wedding she is planning to stay there, as it will be a lot cheaper than hotel rooms for 4 people. I’m absolutely fine with that, and also mentioned to my mother that it was not a problem and made more sense. I made it very clear to my cousin when I asked her to be in my party that I didn’t want to burden her, just for her to show up and have a place of honor at my wedding. 

So cousin calls me to say that she doesn’t know if she can stay in the party, as my mother is hassling her about the hotel and bridal shower. JNMom plans the bridal shower for a Sunday, when cousin is working. Again, she’s a nurse who works overnight shifts and it’s the summer, people already have vacations planned, she can’t switch her shifts that easily. JNMom is also giving her grief about the hotel, saying, “but we got a good rate!” Yeah... but free is still free. 

So now I’m pissed. I ask my cousin if I can talk to JNMom about her behavior and unfortunately she said no. I’d already been debating cancelling the bridal shower, but this was the last straw. I told her yesterday over the phone that I wasn’t comfortable and was canceling and she had a mini meltdown. Stopped by there today and was treated to the main event.

Apparently, I am the worst. She wishes she never became a mother, because we’re too different and I don’t want to let her do anythingggg and keep pushing her awaaaaay. I’m a liar, because I said yes before and changed my mind. 

Other gems include:

“Your going to HUMILIATE ME, I’ve already called 30 people!” Well.... call them back.(it’s always about what other people will think)

“I already ordered the favors!” Well... you shouldn’t have because you didn’t ask or show me anything. 

“Why won’t you let me do this one nice thing for you?” Because it’s not a nice thing for me, it’s a thing I DON’T WANT. 

All said, I’m really sad. The wishing she wasn’t a mother comment really hurt (I’m adopted, it’s been a complicated journey, and that was said for maximum pain), and I feel bad and guilty that she’s upset. I’m ready to cry, because I feel like I can never have anything that’s just easy and nice. I know that I don’t want to sit through another party where I’m uncomfortable and unhappy just to please her, not for my wedding. 

Anyone have any advice on what’s going to come next? I have a feeling that she’s going to try to recruit some FMs. My enabler of a father hid in the basement and got all sad when I left, but would never stand up for me against her. He’s more of a whisper-“Do what you want it’s your day!”-behind-her-back kinda guy. Luckily my FDH has a spine forged from the strongest steel, so I’ve got plenty of support there, but everyone else always gives in because it’s easier than dealing with her.",JUSTNOMIL
"Am I the asshole here?

My DHs family bought a house in another state a few years ago. Even though they live less than 10 minutes away from our house, every significant event or even none-significant has been at the ""vacation"" house. 

For many reasons, I find the vacation house very stressful and claustrophobic. There is no privacy or space for me to have alone time (which MIL thinks is rude btw, we are expected to spend all of our time with them from the moment we wake up). It is a 2.5 hour drive away and the dog is not always welcome up there. I also find that I cope better with his family in short bursts 2-3 hours here, 1 hour there. That's pretty hard when you are driving 5 hours. 

Here is the current situation. Mother's day was up there and we did not go. FM were sent on us for disappointing MIL and DH handled it great. Now, it's father's day and a birthday. We shared that it was stressful up there and asked if there was a way to celebrate closer to *both* our homes. This is the response, somewhat edited:

""I’m sorry you feel stress when you come up here with a lot of people. I was hoping that you might be able to put up with it for a day to be with the family here.
 
I’ve thought about how I want to spend my birthday and Father’s Day, and I want to come to the place that makes me happiest with my family and a few friends.  I think that on this special occasion I can choose the place and hope that the people most important to me will be able to come. This will be a rare moment to have all three siblings together.""

DH is feeling guilty for not celebrating Mother's or father's day or recent birthdays with his family. I'm feeling frustrated because even though we asked to celebrate where we *both* live, they are consistently unavailable. To me this email says that seeing DH is not as important as the location. 

Am I the asshole for once again saying no to a weekend I know causes me stress, anxiety and always ends up with DH and I fighting?

The reason I'm posting here is because you all know that these situations don't develop over night. There have been consistent boundary stomping that is still happening where MIL keeps changing what we agree on and seems allergic to accepting any dates we throw out. She has to be in control of the timing and activities of any visit. To me this feels like one more attempt to control DH by acting like the only way to see his family is to drive to another state, EVEN THOUGH WE LIVE 10 APART! Oh, and his sister lives in the same city as us, and his brother is temporarily living at home.

Edit: DH responded to the request saying he was happy they had planned an event that made them happy but that we would not be attending. We offered to see them at a restaurant, grab drinks or host a BBQ for them. So far no response from FIL.

But, we are still trying to schedule with MIL for mother's day. Originally we invited to take her out or make her dinner. She wanted us to make her dinner. Then... She wanted a bike ride in addition to dinner but instead of dinner she wanted a late afternoon meal. We said we could do that this Saturday or five other dates. None of the dates worked so we were like okay give us some times. Today she's like ""I rescheduled my event for Saturday I can see you now! Come over, do some IT for me, then we will go for a walk at my house then you can make me dinner later at your house!"" 

We are being up front about the time commitment (2-3 hours). Who knows what will happen next.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hey folks! This got super long, sorry! DH had a phone call with his JNMIL Sunday, and I've been struggling processing it, and where we go from here. Please, share your wisdom with us! I desperately need a reality check, and DH will also be following this post and reading/responding to comments if he wants.

It’s been a while since I’ve posted about my JNILs, but luckily that’s because I finally found the peace I needed to drop the rope.  I’ve been encouraging DH to think about what he wants, I’ve been asking a lot of questions, and I’ve been trying to give advice when he asks for it that’s in line with his goals. So, a lot of, “OK, what are your boundaries? Do you think that’s reasonable? Do you want some help with wording?” that kind of thing.

Because of that, he realized that having a relationship with his dad probably wouldn’t ever happen.  JNFIL is most likely a narc, stubborn as all get out, and NEVER wrong lol. It’s always been his way or the highway, and he doesn’t really have room in his reasoning for close friends/family members who are doing something he perceives as “wrong.” In fact, JNMIL just admitted that very thing - JNFIL believes it’s his moral duty to make sure certain people (I think mostly DH) do what’s best for themselves.  The problem is, he’s decided that our move isn’t what’s best for us. I translated this into, FIL gets to decide what’s best for us and try and badger us into doing what he wants. Which, controlling much?

However, he used to think his mom was just an enabler and was trying not to rock the boat, and that he could work on rebuilding a relationship with her. Now we’re not so sure.

DH called his mom on Sunday after 2 months of no contact, which he initiated when he realized that worrying about talking to his mom on top of moving 700 miles away to a new city a month before me with no local support system (my family is 2 hours away and difficult to get to by car) was just too much for him to handle. I desperately need a reality check about this phone call, because my mind is boggled.  DH let me sit in on it because he tends to forget details and phrasing, and only remembers how he feels, which makes it difficult for him when they try to gaslight him. There was so much in this phone call, it feels like it lasted so much longer than it did. I’m just going to do bullet points (I think) to keep things as concise as possible. He asked if she thought she could have a conversation with him without going into all the nitty-gritty shit, just picking up as if the last 8 months hadn’t happened. She couldn’t so instead they talked for 40 minutes going around the same merry-go-round we’ve been stuck on since September. Yay.

1. HOLY GUILT TRIP BATMAN. According to JNMIL, JNFIL has had stroke-level or near-stroke level blood pressure FOR TWO MONTHS, all because of the move and DH’s [NC text](https://imgur.com/a/jB247sY). “He almost DIED” and is now on 19 different medications. To break that down, he probably takes about 4 pills daily - cholesterol, metformin, blood thinners, and something else DH couldn’t remember. On top of that, JNFIL is now on several different blood pressure medications (maybe trying to find the right one?) as well as anti-anxiety meds (we call BS - JNFIL is so staunchly against therapy/psychiatry/psychology/the existence of mental health we doubt he took the time to ask for/get anti-anxiety meds). All of this seems like overkill to me, but we’re not sure how to verify/if we should verify. Also trying to encourage DH that just because they want to place the blame on him, that he should try not to feel guilty, because this could’ve been avoided if JNFIL didn’t have his panties bunched so tight. JNMIL also mentioned at one point that DH should apologize to JNFIL because that would probably help his blood pressure to go down. NOT HIS JOB MIL, he has nothing to apologize for. Jeez. There was also guilt-trippy statements like “We encouraged your grandparents not to call you since we didn’t want you to cut them out too.” Except DH’s text said “don’t try to contact us through a third party” not “Nobody in our family is allowed to call us EVER” lol I LOVE THE GUILT TRIPPING AND EASILY PREDICTABLE NARC BEHAVIORS THIS IS SO MUCH FUN
2. “They’re just so concerned” Except, since when did concern turn into badgering DH to make the decision they think is right? They’ve never once listened to why we decided to move, except to pick out that we wanted to live in a bigger city with more things to do, which they twisted into “we’re bored.” Also at some point, MIL tried to claim they’ve always supported him and always wanted what’s best for him. DH’s thoughts on that were that he has not once felt supported by them since we told them we were moving. My thoughts were “no the fuck you have not always supported him wtf????”
3. DH brought up how often they indirectly blame me. Basically every phone call they’ve said something like “well, since you got married” or “we knew after the wedding…” And every time he mentions how uncool it is we get highlights of the Narcissist’s Prayer - “we never said that” (DH quotes back at them) “oh, well we didn’t mean it like that.” This time JNMIL actually thought before she spoke, and then tried to tell him that they’ve always thought of me like a daughter (HA! Fuck no you have not)
4. Then they got into our actual discussions/reasoning behind the move. We told them MONTHS in advance to give them time to adjust/think/process/have respectful conversations (we were planning on trying to move in the spring, we told them at the end of September). We knew it would be difficult for them, so we didn’t want to spring it on them. Never making that mistake again.  All they heard was “we’re bored, we hate it, we have no plan, we’re just gonna up and move.” When in reality we outlined a plan, DH discussed his desire to be in a more forward-thinking area, especially as it affects his career, and when he would start looking for a job, and that it would go job -&gt; apartment -&gt; move. But they didn’t want to hear our well thought out, grown-up plans. Just that we were moving on a whim, because we’re bored. Yeah, ok. Also, they “just couldn’t understand why \[DH\] would leave such a good job. We thought you were happy there.” He was, but it’s not like that’s the only good job that exists in the whole world. ILs are definitely creatures of habit, comfort, and complacency. I’m so glad and proud DH wants to rise above that.
5. JNMIL also asked, towards the end of the phone call, if DH thought it was a good conversation. Because almost every single phone call they’ve had, DH hangs up, processes (with me, how fucking dare he /s) and a couple days later realizes it was actually a horrible phone call. Also, lady, how the fuck is a phone call in which your son has to YELL AT YOU to get you to shut up and consider his feelings, not just yours (yes, that actually happened the last time he talked to her before he moved). And most phone calls result in DH not wanting to talk to them, and twice has resulted in him sending a group text trying to set a boundary with them. Which she calls “ugly texts” despite DH trying to be as loving but as firm as possible. I know she just thinks they’re ugly because DH is their baaaabyyy and he shouldn’t have any boundaries whatsoever. [NYE boundary text](https://imgur.com/a/2jvEJo7) (DH is blue, FIL is green and MIL is yellow)

The phone call ended with a couple gems, including “we’re not even sure who you are anymore” and something about raising him well or whatever (my first reaction was a Proverbs 22:6 “Train up a child in the way he should go, \[a\]And when he is old he will not depart from it.”) But also, DH is a fully certified adult - completely independent, has been for years, is 25, and is FUCKING MARRIED. She also ALMOST gave a primo example of a fauxpology - including starting with the phrases “If I didn’t” and “I was just so hurt.” Luckily the words “I’m sorry” never left her mouth, so if she tries to claim she apologized, he’s got her on a technicality.

We’re not really sure where to go from here. Most people don’t understand the situation “they’re faaaaamily, you should try” and all that. The problem is, it’s been 8 months, and people who don’t have JustNos in their life/don’t know all the details really don’t understand that that’s probably not an option.  I want to encourage DH to have a relationship with his mom, but I’m just not sure if that’s possible. If every time out leads to hour-long conversations about how our move just WRECKED their lives, and how DH is a terrible son who’s killing his father, then I’m worried he’ll have to go NC completely, which we had been thinking we could avoid. I feel really bad for DH that this is what he’s having to deal with after having uprooted his whole life to move to a completely new area, and because he’s having to do it without his family in his corner. He’s got friends back in his home state that are a good support system, and my family loves him and accepts him (thank God, they helped him realize his normal meter was broken!!!).

I desperately need a reality check. I feel like JNMIL ticked off so many Narc boxes. I want to believe the best, and that at worst, it’s just FLEAS and that there’s hope, but I have no idea.",JUSTNOMIL
"TW: Abuse

 My mother has been abusive to me my entire life. I have made plans to get out but I need to know about what happens afterward? I'm 17 I turn 18 in a month. Due to reasons out of my control, I was unable to get a job. Even then my mother takes almost all my money. I manage to save very little at a time. I want to cut off contact as soon as I turn 18. Living on the streets is way better than this. If anyone has advice on where to go, what to do and any other advice is greatly appreciated. 

Background: My mother has spent my entire life hating and hitting me. She verbally attacks my weight and height. She insinuates that I'm a skank because my chest is larger than hers. She thinks I do all these terrible things but I never leave the house. Ever. Not even for school activities that are mandatory.",JUSTNOMIL
"PPG has 3 children. My DH(30s) and 2 younger children between 10 and 14. 

Youngest Sibling is on the Spectrum whilst Middle Sibling is not. 

I've always noticed that YS is the Golden Child, this kid might as well walk on water and it's only gotten more obvious since the diagnosis. YS breaks iPads, Nintendo U screens and Xbox pads in frustration when a game doesn't go their way, this apparently isn't a bad thing cause ""kid is Autistic, kid can't help it"". Nevermind that kid was doing this before diagnosis and no shits were given then either. 

Middle Sibling is going through puberty, hormones raging so is copping an attitude. This apparently is the end of the world, PPG has confiscated all of MS devices and changed the WiFi password as punishment. MS cops more of an attitude because YS doesn't get punished like this for things that are 100 times worse. Now PPG has started to lay the ground work of MS coming to live with us, because she doesn't want to deal with MS. She plays it off as a joke but the joke is getting increasingly frequent. Her complaints about MS are not limited to DH and I, noooo now she's putting them in Social Media, where she's friends with MS, where she's also calling MS the horrible word for an illegitimate child. Her profile now consists of vulger statuses about MS, loving statuses about YS and my LO and memes about Autism.. You know the ones, ""Autism moms are warriors/hero's without capes"" those sort, which I don't disagree with but they somehow make my eyes roll so far in my head it's painful when she posts them.

Just a bit of a rant really. DH sees the favouritism, but there's nothing we can do apart from take MS in when it's no longer a joke about kicking the kid out.


Edit** What I meant by YS acting this way before diagnosis was that YS wasn't corrected in anyway shape or form for ""bad/inappropriate"" behaviour, I meant that PPG now uses the diagnosis as an excuse to no longer parent YS AT ALL. She uses the diagnosis as a free pass to let YS be physically violent to objects and people. 

The amount of times I've had to step in and correct YS behaviour towards my LO because they were being to rough with him(1-2years at the time) is bordering on ridiculous.",JUSTNOMIL
"Long time lurker, first time poster.
Back story - we live with my parents and can not afford to move out at the moment. So, alas, nc is not an option. 

Fun note - my personal nicknames for my JNMum and enabler father are... 
Captain Cunt and The Spineless Kid

So my 2yr old son has a sponsored toddle at nursery this Thursday, where he can dress as a pirate.
The other half works nights, and unfortunately works Thursday, so can't attend.
I asked my dad if he wanted to go. While discussing this again just now mother piped up and said she'd like to go. I said it was in a field, knowing her back is bad and she wouldn't be able to sit down. No bother, she breezily replied, father can carry a chair around for her. 

She again said she'd like to go. I don't want her there. Swearing, calling other children ugly and fat, belching, complaining, demanding to be the centre of attention. So I said okay, but best behavior. None of the above. She pulled a face like a cat's butt, sulked, said she wasn't talking to me. Ignored me while I repeated my request, and added that I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.

So now a lovely afternoon with child and his grandad is now going to be stressful as fuck waiting for my mother to say something awful and hate filled in public, under the assumption she's amusing and charming. 

I'm so worried that other parents will hate me, and by extention, my loving child. That nursery staff will think badly of me. I really struggle talking to people, making friends. Being, normal, I guess. I'm just full of anxiety, and riled from having to stand my ground. From every little thing having to be a battle where I'm always wrong. 
Sorry, I just needed to get it out.",JUSTNOMIL
"My MIL and I have a very strained relationship. But she is super obnoxious about requesting photos. Every morning she texts “Any new pics?” Usually it goes ignored. We send probably one or two a week. DH is awful with photos. He takes the worst pictures of LO asleep with mismatched clothes on, face not even showing. I take the cute, posed pictures with matching clothes. That’s the moms job, right?

Anyway. We visited them for the first time ever at their house this weekend. They live in a popular beach town. Lots of family was there. Every time LO was held by anyone except me, MIL couldn’t whip out her phone fast enough to get a photo.  As soon as he went back to me, she couldn’t care less about pictures. I pointed it out to DH. 

We didn’t bring it up to her, but I told DH he’s in charge of photos to his mother at this point. She’s being so passive aggressive toward me, I don’t care to send any at this point. And he says “I’m only going to send her picture of you holding him. It’ll be funny!” Ahhhhh, I love that guy!",JUSTNOMIL
"Last night d(dumbass) h tells me he wants out of the marriage &amp; wants my sister and I to move out immediately.  Ok, that swells and all, but NWJ is the owner &amp; she's going to have to take us to court evict us.  I'm digging my heels in for a fight.  I'm her adult in 3 weeks for her surgery.  So either she plays nicely with me or I'm turning into the bitch from hell. 

Now if she offers me a nice wad of money to get lost &amp; dumbass does too, I'll go merrily into the night.  

Yes, I am pissed off as hell.  He tried to play all nice with me this afternoon.  But I can be a shrill bitch &amp; let him known I'm not playing.

"Regardless I handled this wrong because I ended up getting scolded and told “you stress me out”:by Hubby. Which is ridiculous but I understand seeing as the way he admittedly deals with his mother is by ignoring or giving in. Both of which created the MGG she is. 

So we pass by for lunch which it’s ok because it’s a short visit bc the baby screams to leave after about 45 min.  Better for me  then when they come here, also my baby is now in the phase of “I will not eat unless I’m in a dark isolated room away from anything that could be interesting or distracting.” Makes going out such a pain bc she won’t eat if we are out! Even if she is hungry. Also my husband is way on top of  baby supervision when we’re out of the house. 

So we are their and we they ask my husband if he had “told our maid something” (I see this as over involved bc we didn’t tell them about the issue w the neighbor they over heard and it’s not like we have to report to them how we run our house ) Apparently when she cleans the back yard our neighbor gets annoyed. It’s a house design flaw not the maids fault. So nothing can be done the are needs to be cleaned. Hubby responds telling MGG the report. MGG gets all worked up over how “that maid is causing problems with the neighbor and how it’s the worst thing you can do” etc etc. 

Now I should have just said “Relax don’t work your self up she is our maid not yours”  end it there.

No why would I do that? Like I said at this point everything bothers me. 

So I ask “what are you talking about” which kind of kills the convo and then follow it up with “why do they know and I don’t? “ - so bitchy but shut his parents up 

So in the car ride home I nicely say to my husband “so weird how your mom got so worked up over our maid. Did you say something about her to your mom” 

He was like no they overheard it and involved themselves. 
Me that’s not appropriate. 
Him I know I just ignore it. 
Me how has that been working for you?

Him - you stress me out every time we see my parents it’s something. 
Me - 😑 their actions not mine  🤷🏻‍♀️

I should have just ended it with “don’t worry MGG we have it handled”  🤦🏻‍♀️",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi everyone, background story is, met her as a single mother, been together a couple of years, get on great with the kids (they call me dad)  but... Ever since the start I’ve never really got on with her family. Now to the point her mother will walk out of the room when I’m there. They haven’t made the effort to learn anything about me or involve me in family gatherings etc. 

It started out I feel because my partner talked to her mother a lot and as we were progressing through the relationship we had typical relationship problems that she then talked to her family about. This was down to every minor argument and disagreement. They obviously weren’t happy with this and made this pretty clear when we were in group situations, even to the point of including the ex partner in and asking him about his job, life etc. right in front of me. I don’t get invited to family things and they will try to avoid things that I will be at even if it involves the kids. 


I’m not saying I’m perfect, there’s definitely things that I’ve learnt and would change if I could and I’m sure it’s the same with her. Difference being is I didn’t go whinging to my family about every problem. There were a couple of times my family seen me upset and offered advice etc. Once we’d sorted it out my family treated her no different. 

My worry is, is this ever going to get better? I feel like I don’t have her support in the situation as she just wants to try keep everyone happy rather than sticking up and backing me. It’s pretty hard obviously with step kids involved as it is but this is made worse by her family. I know I’m not dating her family but damm it’s pretty hard when there’s all these difficult scenarios. 

Her mother and step father are both very controlling and this is something that’s happened to her in all her past relationships which suggests to me it’s not just a problem with me personally. 

We’ve had a big argument about it and are currently on “hold”.  I said she would end it and her response was “yeah may as well”. I feel like she never fights to try get me to stay or fight for me in anything. Should I just ditch this and walk?

TL;DR don’t get on with partners family at all. Should I walk?",JUSTNOMIL
"Sorry about the text walls - tldr at end. 

My bf (32M) and I (27F) have been dating for 5 years, living together for 3. He moved across the country to get away from his unbearable mother a decade ago. We both have our share of mental health problems. He is a high functioning alcoholic while I've been battling severe depression, anxiety, chronic pain for years and later developed a sleeping disorder that requires me to take stimulants to control my excessive day time sleepiness, which worsens my anxiety so I have to pair that with some anti-anxiety medication. I have seeked treatments and therapy since I was 17. My conditions are at a pretty manageable state with regular treatments, but I can be throw off my track with very stressful events. OTOH, bf still refuses to seek treatment or therapy for his alcoholism. It's something he/we are trying to work on, despite me preferring him to get professional help. Needless to say, we have had rocky patches in our relationship due to our mental health issues. 

BF hid our relationship from his parents for 1.5 years. They found out when they came to visit him and noticed his place is all cleaned up (he's a slob). Knowing their son, they knew right away he got a gf. We weren't serious at the time so he would kept brushing off their request to meet me or video chat (after they returned to the East coast).

Bf has troubles talking about his feelings. But, the general sense I get is that he dreads going back to visit his parents (or rather just mom). My family is pretty dysfunction too, so I understand where he's coming from. I actively encourage him to go visit his family because he does want to spend time with his other family members. We eventually went to visit together last year. He went for two weeks and I joined him for the last week. 

Before the trip, I had a lot of anxiety about his mom from the horror stories he mentioned. I told him I rather get an airbnb or hotel than stay at his parents place. He insisted I stay with them. Of course, that was a major mistake. Long story short, his mom is a two-faced, manipulative mom that acts really nice up front and really nasty behind the back. She has a set of conservative Chinese values that don't agree with me very much (I'm Taiwanese-Canadian). She threw a fit one time we came back to the house and I didn't greet her loud enough for her to hear. I didn't know about this because they speak a different dialect of Chinese. My bf defended me during dinner but said some pretty insulting things to his mom. She went full blown berserk. On the ride back from dinner, she started calling her friends and to talk shit about me and her own son, made sure to do this partly in Mandarin so I knew what she's saying about me.

Next day both bf's dad and bf made me suck up to her and apologize to calm the storm. (Apparently that's what the family always does when she has her outbursts). I unhappily obliged but this triggered a lot of psychological abuse trauma I've gone through when I was a kid. Broke down alone that night for hours in the room I was staying in (bf in his old bedroom). Bf didn't know the shape I was in until he came to say goodnight. I ended up going to the ER because of severe self harm and suicidal urges. (His parents don't know my health history - conservative Asian families don't take that very well). After I came back from ER at 5am (I don't think they knew), I knew I can't stand a second more of his mom. I tried to get my bf to get his parents out of the house for breakfast so I can sneak out and go to a hotel for the last night. That didn't work, so I called a Uber, packed my things and walked out without saying a word while his mom was talking to me in their dialect she knows I don't speak.

Ever since then she's been telling him to break up with me. I put my foot down told my bf I will not put up with her toxicity for the sake of my health. I'll go visit her in the future, but never staying at their house. I'll also walk out if she becomes overly passive aggressive during any visit. He can do the same if my family treats him poorly (they don't). I don't care if he has to tell his parents we broke up to get her off our ass. His parents also don't know we've been living together for so long our country considered us common law couples now. Bf told me as much as he hates her he still cares about his family, so the fact me and his mom can't get along causes him a lot of stress (he's gone back to drinking when the stress becomes too much to handle). His dad was great during the visit. He told my bf after we came back to the West Coast that MIL will never get along with DIL - knowing from personal experience - most significantly when his (future DIL) own wife refused to let him go visit his mother on her deathbed and caused a havoc when they went to the funeral. 

Side note, future MIL arranged (literally) a wife for her eldest son (lives in same city). She would call my bf to complain about her for the first two years, and wanted them to get divorced. According to bf, his mom and his brother's wife finally seemed to get along now. 

I honestly don't know what to do. I feel bad this is causing my partner so much stress and I'm sure he's thought of breaking up. But, I am proud of myself for standing up for my own mental well being as it's something I struggled to do all my life. I love my bf a lot. It hurts to see that he has to suffer because of what I had to do. When he's drunk he would said things along the lines of he wish to get a girlfriend with no mental health issues, and it'll all be better. Obviously life isn't that easy, and I think deep down he knows that. I don't even see myself being able to have a peaceful wedding. I don't care if I don't have one - bf cares because his family would expect him to have one. My own mother can get pretty toxic too, in a different way. Putting my mother and future MIL in the same room is calling for a disaster. Throughout my years of therapy I've learned to keep my distance from toxic people and live for myself. Bf can't quite get his mindset straightened out because he's still trying to be a people pleaser.

How do you all handle these kind situations and stay sane?

Tldr: Future MIL caused a big mental breakdown during my first visit as bf insisted I stayed in their house and the constant toxicity was too much for me. I walked out to get a hotel for the last night in the city, in front of MIL (situation could not be avoided) without saying a word to her. Ever since then she's been telling bf to break up with me when he makes his daily calls to his parents (they insist on this even though he's a grown man).

"To start off, I thought she was awesome at first. I moved in with my then-boyfriend and honestly, she seemed like a cool person. I think I was just too young and missed all the red flags. 

We had a lot of problems in the few months so we escaped three hours away after she seemed completely off her rocker. Eventually, my oh-so-wonderful MIL got into a relationship with this one guy after dumping her husband (after having him quit his job and come home to work so he can spend his time with everyone instead of seeing him once a month or so) and asked me to carry hers and her new mans baby. Yeah, no. 

I got pregnant and she distanced herself ASAP. I was still an idiot craving some kind of interaction with her so I kept reaching out and she would brush me off, send one word answers while texting her, and in general be an asshole to me. It was super confusing because IRL she would be really nice. 

Fast forward and I have the baby, she hardly sees him, but yet pretends to be worlds best grandma, lol yeah right. She refuses to see him or talk to me anymore but what really feels weird is she never talked to DH, but always talked with his cousin. I mentioned it to the cousin and he laughed and said it’s because she hates me. Apparently, she thinks that I’m a controlling bitch and that I turned her son against her and that he hates her now because of me! Oh, and she never texts him because it’s probably always me texting back and she hates talking to me, so why bother? I hate the thought that she uses me as an excuse not to talk to her own son. She acts like a huge bitch to me and always talks down to me and makes fun in front of anyone and everything. DH doesn’t do confrontation with anyone so that’s useless and I don’t want to upset him starting something with her again. 

I just feel really effected by this, unfortunately, because even after all she’s done I really thought she cared about me somewhat as a daughter since she always talked about it in the beginning and how love is unconditional and you shouldn’t take it away after you give it. She would tell me how great I am and how she thinks I will be a wonderful mother and now everything is pretty much the opposite. She thinks I’m a horrible person and wife and that my husband is my “bitch puppet”. I was always told by my mother that I’m a horrible daughter, that I’ll just end up like whoever she hated at the moment, why couldn’t I be this or that, so it feels like this cuts deep into that wound all over again. I’m mad that she thinks that way of her son and she wants nothing to do with her grandson. I just don’t know how I can move past this right now or what I should even do. Just needed to finally get this off my chest, among a bunch of other things but this is the most recent. I don’t know, I’m just so mad when it comes to her, she just seems selfish and hateful. But of course pretends to be a great and loving person to everyone else, so maybe I am the problem? God, I don’t even know. Thank you for reading this.

TL;DR - MIL is a bitch to me and hates me. I’m mad and don’t want to be.",JUSTNOMIL
"So, some background. She is not technically my MIL yet because I'm not yet married, but I have been dating my boyfriend for almost 3 years and we definitely plan to marry in the future.

Before anything, I would like to point out that we are both asian living in south east asia, so suggestions like ""just move out"", ""just ignore her"", or something along the lines of ignoring/avoiding her is useless.
I will refer to her as LK (her initials), and boyfriend as BF

My boyfriend and I are both in our early 20s. I met my boyfriend 3 years ago when we were both freshmen at university. I have been struggling with depression ever since I was 13 because I was bullied and my parent's relationship was shitty. I was in a very bad place when I first met my boyfriend because on top of my shitty childhood, I had just gotten out of abusive relationship. I was raped and abused by my ex, but I wouldn't talk about the details now as I just want you to know what I went through when I met my boyfriend. My boyfriend helped me went through dark times and talked me out of committing suicide. He knew my deepest and darkest secret, but he still loves me and accepts me for who I am. He is so perfect for me. I love him very much and he loves me just as much because I ""fixed"" the holes in his heart caused by years of mental and physical abuse by LK.

I first met LK a few months into the relationship. I've known since the start she doesn't really like me because their family is Christian and I am not. LK is overly religious kind of person that is always Jesus this and Jesus that. My family has never been religious, so am I and my BF.

Ever since then, the terror started. She blames me for everything. BF not going to church this week? My fault. BF forgot to reply to her text? My fault. BF wakes up later than usual on weekends? My fault. BF got a tattoo? My fault and according to her I should've known that on the bible tattoo attracts satan (I swear she told me this). BF stood up for me when she yells at me for something I didn't do? My fault. BF stood up for HIMSELF because he has been mentally and physically abused by her ever since he was young? My fault. LK explicitly told me that ever since BF started dating me, he changed and that I ruined their family. LK blames me for not believing in Jesus. LK FORCES me to go to church and believe in Jesus. I can't tell her no because as I said, we are asian and you know how fucked up asian culture is when it comes to ""respecting your elder"".

I am in university full time, I support myself even though my parents can support me, I am active in uni, I work hard, I get good grades, and recently got full scholarship to continue masters degree, yet NONE of these impress her. Simply because I DON'T BELIEVE JESUS.

My BF told LK about my depression and told her to stop giving me so much shit because it worsens my mental health and LK has the audacity to say its because I don't have God in my heart. That my depression is the result of me not believing God. That God is punishing me for not being religious. BF grew distant with LK each day because of how mentally abusive she is to me and BF, and LK blames me for everything. BF feels more comfortable with me than LK, and she accuses me for stealing her son away from her. LK expects BF to open up to her but when BF tries to do so LK attacks the shit out of BF because apparently everything that happens to BF is the result of him not going to church enough. Both BF and I are in so much hell because of LK. How narcissistic she is and how everything must only go according to her way. She thinks she is the best person in the world because she has so much faith in Jesus.

I want to marry my BF and I want to spend the rest of my life with him. But now I don't even know if I really want that anymore. For your information, in asian culture, oldest son bears the responsibility of their parents after the oldest son is married. My BF is the oldest son. So no matter how far we move away, LK will come with us. We simply cant refuse. I am in a very difficult position because I fucking hate LK but I want to spend the rest of my life with BF.

She feeds me so much negativity (as a fucking religious person, the irony) that it started to mess with my mind a lot. She caused me so much stress that I started to hallucinate (I hear sounds). The sounds told me to overdose and just die. My thoughts constantly convince me that maybe if I die she will finally understand the depth of her actions.

Please give me suggestions on how to deal with LK.
Please ask me any question if you want more detail.",JUSTNOMIL
"Following on from my previous post.. On Saturday my FDH and I drove a couple of hours to his parents home to pick up his last few items and check over his boat that he urgently needs to bring to our current home.

Upon arrival, the leeches were already sucking our happiness away, hovering by the car, waiting to pounce on us as soon as we stepped out.

FMIL greets me with my full name in an unfriendly tone. I be overly nice in return but don’t bother to make much conversation.

She then says to me “oh K, your hair looks *different*”. Now please note that when FMIL says something is “different”, she means this in a bad way, there is no compliment in this statement.

I brushed off her nasty comment and was laughing on the inside at how petty she is and said “my hair is exactly the same as when you last saw it, same old!”

FDH and I do what we need to do, packing boxes in his old room. FFIL comes in to “supervise” us and make his usual condescending comments towards FDH, an extremely uncomfortable feeling. He always has to have the power and control. *eye roll*

We check FDH’s boat and his parents follow us out to the paddock, hovering over us and bossing FDH around. FDH replies sarcastically to everything they say. FFIL makes a condescending comment towards me about how he wants me to touch the electric fence to see if it’s “on” and tries to put in it a joking way. I look at him and say nothing. He clearly thinks I’m an idiot but the joke is on him as I grew up on an actual farm and know more than he thinks. This is a clear example of FDH’s parents never bothering to get to know me lol.

As we head back towards the house, FMIL finds this the perfect time to finally show an interest in our upcoming wedding, wow what a surprise, we have only been planning it for the past 24 months...

FMIL: “who did you invite from our side of the family?”

FDH: “Everyone”

FMIL: “You don’t need to be a smart ass, L! What do you mean by everyone?”

FDH: “Literally everyone in our family”

FMIL then makes nasty comments about family members who she does not like and says there will be “drama” because we aren’t allowing children and FDH’s uncle and aunty will be unhappy about this.

I quickly jumped in at this stage and said “no actually, we have spoken to them about it and they completely understand”. FMIL shuts up about that quickly.

So she starts on her next attack.

FMIL: “L, your brother when he was getting married, let me look at their wedding list and asked me if there was anyone who I wanted to invite... I mean.. I know you’re not your brother.. But it was nice of him to do that...”

Me on the inside: ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!!!!???? 

FDH: “And why would we do that? We are paying for this wedding ourselves, we are keeping it to a minimum”

Me (I had had enough by this stage): “It’s our wedding by the end of the day and we choose who we are having there. Unless you’re going to pay for those extra guests, then no, it’s not going to happen”

FMIL (who I can see is starting to get hot-headed but tries to play the victim role): “Well I was just asking.. I mean it would be nice if you just showed me the guest list...”

FDH: “Not happening, there is no need for you to see it”

FMIL goes all quiet. I can see her working on her crocodile tears. All I can think is fuck off, you only want to see the list because you are a nosey bitch.

Seem as she is losing this battle, she starts on her next attack.

FMIL: “Ohh we got your wedding invitation, geeze, you sent them out very early!” She says this whilst laughing and in quite a bitchy tone.

Me: “That’s because we had to send them internationally as well...” My tone of voice was blunt and my niceness at this stage was wearing thin but I didn’t want this wicked witch of the north to see this.

Although, I must admit that her comment did piss me off because most people would say “I received your wedding invitation, it looks lovely!” The future in-laws on the other hand, never have anything nice to say and never bothered to contact us to say they had received it. They are true narc’s.

Finally the car is packed and we are ready to go, we had only been there for an hour. Unfortunately just as we are leaving and my hopes are high to get away from the leeches, FDH decides that this is the perfect time to ask about where his grandparents money is that his parents owe him. Oh goodness...

Instantly they both ark up. FMIL states that even though his aunty had given them her share of the money, FMIL hasn’t decided whether or not she will give her sons the money she is meant to.
Are you fucking kidding me?! How greedy can one person be?!

FDH argues that it is his money and it’s what his nonna wanted. FMIL then starts raising her voice, making disgusting accusations that FDH’s aunty is lying about everything and that their aunty was stealing their nonna’s pension money. YEAH RIGHT. I don’t believe that for a second. FFIL joins in on these accusations and is talking so poorly about FDH’s aunty.

FDH tries to calm them but it is too late. So he makes a remark that his parents are even lucky to be invited to our wedding due to me having the brunt of their behaviour. *Oh dear god, he has added fuel to the fire.*

They instantly turn to me and say “What does he mean K, we haven’t done anything to you!” It astounds me how narcs work, thinking they are so sweet and innocent. Wow, just wow.

I immediately laugh and say “well actually you have. On numerous occasions, you’ve never bothered to get to know me, you made instant judgement about me and don’t respect me.”

They both again ark up but this time FMIL has started her crocodile tears and walks about two metres away saying “I’ve apologised to K, multiple times, what more can I do?!” I could tell she becoming agitated.

I didn’t respond because she obviously was talking ABOUT me not TO me, one of my pet hates when people do this when you’re clearly there present.

I look at FFIL and state the time when he called me untrustworthy regarding my business. FFIL denies this instantly and makes patronising comments about FDH, stating that he “must of interpreted what he said wrongly”. He tried to say that IF he did say it, it would of been a joke and no truth to it but that he was positive he never said it.
My response: “Well some say there is some truth to people’s jokes and I believe this”.

FFIL continues to deny that he ever said it and that he doesn’t think that of me. Yeah, right.. Who am I going to believe FDH or FFIL? FDH, always.

FDH brings up a few more issues and instantly they start yelling at the top of their lungs. Denying everything and pointing the finger at us.

FDH looks at me and says “Do you want to get out of here?” I said yep!

We jump in the car and can still hear them yelling. We drive off instantly, not bothering to look back.

We arrive home and FDH’s aunty calls him in tears, it turns out after we had left, FMIL called her and abused her greatly. We couldn’t believe it. All because their aunty had done the right thing and given FDH and his brother the money they are owed that their nonna wanted them to have.

FDH is now reconsidering having his parents at our wedding. He is disgusted by their behaviour (as am I) and the things they said about his aunty, who has been more of a mother to him than FMIL. They are nasty people.

I am proud of myself for standing up to them. Yes things could of been worded better from myself and FDH, but with narcs, you’re never going to win. I was more assertive than I ever have been and usually I would worry about hurting peoples feelings and be so anxious that I would make myself feel sick or be in tears.

But this time, I am just proud of how we handled the situation and supported each other. What do I owe these two narcs? Absolutely nothing!",JUSTNOMIL
"My parents (JYDad and JNSMum) go every year to their home country for at least 3 months. 

Yesterday (Monday) is the day they left and I am so happy I don’t have to deal with them until they return Sep 11. Even then, BF and I will be away for a week in a different part of our country, so that’s an extra week of not seeing them. Yay!

JNSMum and I had an argument about 2 weeks ago (see post history) and JYDad cancelled our last family dinner on Sunday because he ‘had lots of shit to do’ (though I’m extremely sceptic) and we’d already been told their last Sunday there would be no family dinner so they could just pack. 

So I haven’t really talked to them in 2 weeks (only JYDad BARELY). 

There will still be phone calls and messages while they’re away (not that many at the start, I assume), but if they start an argument I can work on my boundaries. A warning and I’m hanging up if it continues. 

Talk to me about all the ‘shit’ B(rother)1 is doing wrong? Okay, bye. Complain that B1 isn’t looking after the dog right? Talk to me when you’re done. 

Ugh. Pretty much all complaints are about B1, btw, who’s looking after their dog while he lives in the same house as (formerly)JNMum, who JNSMum HATES with a fiery passion for all the shit JNMum previously put us 3 kids through (B1, B2 and me). 

Overall, I’m looking for to having my Sundays back temporarily and no weekly family arguments about complete bullshit and working on my boundaries.

Edit: BF and I still plan on seeing B1 and his GF on weekends when they’re available for game nights. 

Also, if all goes according to their plans (which seems to be happening so far), my parents aren’t coming back from their trip next year, they’re retiring there instead and only visiting my country for big stuff (weddings, babies, etc.)",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi, everyone! Long time no update. I am an old timer around here. My MIL is Gobbler, a total JNO who has tortured my DH for his whole life and me for more than 20 years. I deleted my older posts but the newer ones give some insight. 

I am NC with Gobbler and haven’t spoken to her since December 2016. Highly recommend. She has tried some shit since but my awesome DH shuts down her shit every time. DH and the kids are VLC. 

Today I want to share some insight into a particularly sneaky type of boundary stomp. When “asking for permission” is actually an attempt to get you to give in. 

Gobbler is the queen of this ruse and it was a large part of the reason I put up with her so long. I *thought* it meant she was trying to be reasonable. I was wrong. 

Here is how it goes: DH and I would set a boundary with Gobbler via phone before she came to visit or we went there. She would agree readily. Then once we were in her presence she would act like that conversation never happened and would ask permission to do the thing we had said no to. “Would that be all right?” 

It could sometimes be hard for my DH and I to say no to this when put on the spot like that mid visit. We eventually learned. 

Some examples:

- When my oldest boys were babies, I visited her for an important event with the kids and without DH. Before I came, she agreed to have her mother care for her nasty, baby-biting dog.  When we arrived, the dog was at Gobbler’s house anyway. *Would it be all right if dog stayed in the basement?* Uh, I guess. An hour later: *Would it be all right if he was just in another room?* Then *in the same room supervised?* And then *This is too hard!! I don’t care what happened last time!!!?!!* I put my foot down. Giant tantrum. We left. 

- *Would it be all right if I wore the baby carrier?* Took an hour to get my starving baby back. After she was told no baby hogging before her visit. 

- For her last visit, I was no contact.  She was clearly told due to her mental abuse of my youngest child during a hotel sleepover her last visit, she would have no unsupervised time with any child. Not even in a room with an open door. And she was no longer welcome in my home.  First thing she does when she gets off the plane? *I am so exhausted and i can’t check in to the hotel for three hours! Can I lay down at your house DH?* NO. Once checked in (early) *Would it be all right if we had a sleepover?* DH says he almost spit out his drink at her audacity. NO. NO. 

So, my friends, let this old lady be your cautionary tale. When they ask permission to do something you already said no to, don’t fall for it. Tell them they already know the answer to that question and enjoy the CBF.",JUSTNOMIL
"This may get kind of long, there’s a lot of back-story:

So I’m pregnant with my second child and kind of struggling to be happy with the pregnancy. My first wasn’t planned and neither is this one, and even though this pregnancy is physically easier, I wasn’t mentally ready for it. My daughter is a year and a half, but has been a tough kid, and hadn’t even weaned when I got pregnant. That being said, I’m a little sensitive. My husband is an only child, my family lives in another state, and we live near his parents. They’ve also helped us out a lot, so they feel entitled to be over all the time and give us lots of unsolicited advice.

When I was pregnant with my daughter, my relationship with my in-laws changed. They had always been a little pushy and overbearing, but it rose to a new level. They started policing my every move and referring to my pregnancy as their grandchild. My MIL would even scold me for doing things like poking the baby’s foot through my belly, saying “you’re hurting my grandchild!” It got worse towards then end, my in-laws threw a tantrum when we said that we didn’t want them to be at the hospital for the birth. We didn’t want ANYONE there. I wanted a relaxed natural birth with a doula and my husband there, that’s it. My parents wouldn’t even fly out until a couple days after the baby had been born to meet us at home. We compromised and said that they could come to the hospital after the baby was born, but we would tell them when to come by because we wanted to be able to rest and bond as a new family. 

Things got so bad that when we went to the hospital, we had to sign paperwork stating that the hospital was not to tell anyone that we were there if asked. My daughter was born around 11am and we texted both sides of the family to share the good news. We FaceTimed my parents and then his parents. While on the phone with his parents they told us they were en route to the hospital. My husband flipped out and yelled at them not to come. We didn’t stress because the hospital knew not to let them in. Well my manipulative MIL talked their way up to our room and they showed up as I was trying to pee for the first time. The nurse yelled at them to leave and my husband went out to talk with him. His dad talked him into going to get coffee, but they left his mom behind. The nurse helped me start breastfeeding my daughter for the first time and then left the room. That’s when my MIL walked in because no one could stop her. She scolded me repeatedly for suffocating “her granddaughter” with my breast. My husband came back and rolled over for them, as usual. He asked to hold the baby, then his mom handed me her phone and asked me to take a picture of them as a “new family.” I lost it. Things have only gotten worse since then, all they do is criticize my patenting and complain if they see us less than once a week. 

Now that I’m pregnant, they’ve started doing it again. Today I went to get a massage and came home to them at our house - they weren’t supposed to be there. They proceeded to lecture me on how risky that was to the baby. They’re also giving me advice on parenting two kids, even though they only had one. I’m one of three and grew up down the street from my cousins. I don’t like their advice and I don’t agree with it. All of a sudden, my body becomes their property because I’m pregnant. I’m already struggling with not wanting this child, the last thing I need is for my over-involved in-laws to be telling me what to do in order to protect the fetus inside my body that they believe belongs to them.",JUSTNOMIL
"So, I recently visited a cousin of mine as well as an aunt (see previous posts for why those two don't talk to SB any more). I never told SB I was in the 'area' - eg. an hour away from where she lives but still close enough that to her if she knew, she'd demand I visit. During a recent conversation, I mentioned in passing something that she didn't realize I knew, so she tried to find out if I had ever visited my cousin's house. I said no but I do text said cousin, and then snarkily reminded her that she wanted me and my cousin to have a relationship.

I don't feel the slightest guilt in lying to Shutterbug, however, my JYSO thinks she'd be extremely hurt if she ever found out and always doesn't favour my methods because he has a wonderful JYMom and JYDad who can be a little overbearing when it comes to certain things but in a well-meaning, supportive way (I also have a JYDad). I told him that this was her doing. She had many chances when I was younger to get to know me but she didn't. She tried to make her into her own version of me - not a mini-SB but the daughter she wanted, not the one she had. She has also told me that she wishes she knew me better (which she doesn't because I feel that she hasn't earned it).

My JYSO has mentioned it a few times. I do wonder if it bothers him a little. And if I am an asshole for so easily lying to SB. I lied to her when I was a teenager as well. Yet I rarely lied to my father and I rarely lie to others as well (I may sugarcoat the truth but that's not the same). I know one time when I had my parents and parents-IL come on board for a lie of omission but it was to protect my SO until we knew he was in a position to receive stressful information without it impacting his recovery but I did tell him and led the initiative. I have no secrets from my SO other than one JYDad asked me to keep. So, in the end, it's only Shutterbug (really just BEC mom though she has many JN moments) I lie to.",JUSTNOMIL
"So DH and FIL went golfing today. All I can really understand from the conversation is that “MIL has her feelings hurt” and that the men “just can’t see how the wires got crossed”

I confirmed with DH that he told FIL that I’m the kind of person who will directly ask for childcare help and follow up with confirmations and instructions (especially since DD is 1 month old). And I also confirmed that DH told FIL that we don’t have plans for DD to stay overnight with them for a very long time. 

DH still believes that his step mom’s motivations are purely that “she wants to spend time with DD”, but he’s missing that she’s abusing her time when she gets it by hleping or screwing with my daughters sleep/eat schedule, and potentially being the cause of a UTI. Not to mention her abusing me by constantly asking for more, despite the fact that I said no. 

I told DH that it would be best if he is present when she visits. He really pushed for me to “invite her for coffee”. Honestly, our relationship before DD was conceived would have warranted that, but ever since, with them moving to town, and her acting like a nut job, that’s just not the case anymore. I explained to him that he would never just “invite my dad to coffee” and he argued and said he would. (Also my dad is the biggest JYDad ever) We settled that he needs to be present for several visits and we will talk about each one before “having coffee” would ever be considered again.

DH thinks that MIL is just “excited to be a grandma”. Even if that’s all this is, I’m tired of her constant pushes to play mommy and get more and more time. 

We ended up settling that the next visits would be as a family, and put a “long term goal” that she might prove that she is worthy of visiting without my hubby. 

So, please don’t husband bash- he is trying to mediate instead of directly pushing back on them and telling them what our boundaries are. At the same time he’s not letting his parents walk all over our boundaries, just enforcing them one at a time as they get too close. He loves them and he’s trying to find a solution where all needs can be met, though I think his efforts will be futile. 

So, until DH decides that the in-laws are as crazy as I think they are, or they prove to me that they’ve come out of their “do over baby” dream land, I’m going to have to occasionally see the in-laws. But I would like to take this time to do some “retraining” for MIL while my hubby is around. Maybe this will show her that DH and I are on the same page about how things need to be.

First, she needs to actually help, not hlep when she comes over. That means stop leaving trash for me to pick up, offer to do things like dishes or laundry before asking to hold the baby, etc. Did you get your in-laws to be more helpful when they come around? If so, how did you do it?

Second, need to put a stop to her bitchy comments that insult my parental decision making (the primary one is around when baby is spitting up, “do you think it’s your diet”? - uh no, if I did, I’d change it) Did you have to point out to your MIL that her comments insulted your parenting? What’s worked? 

Third, enforcing that when I give instructions, as small as they are that they should be followed. Like when baby is spitty, I’ll ask “please don’t bounce her”, then I look over 5 minutes later and she’s bouncing her again.  (Bonus points for ways to hint that she won’t get unsupervised time until she can follow instructions) What’s the best way to show that you’re dead serious about MIL following instructions?

Ok, last question for anyone whose in-laws live nearby:

What is a reasonable “schedule” for grandparents who live on the other side of town (30 mins away)? Roughly once a month? Every other week? Dinner once a month and special events like birthdays? I’m thinking every week is too much to commit to.",JUSTNOMIL
"My DH asked me not to post history about my MIL because of lazy writers pulling stories from here to post on click bait sites. He also asked me not to talk negatively about her to him. He has started going from LC to VLC because he is coming to the realization that everything she had done over the last 20 some odd years has actually left me with something similar to PTSD. Every time DH and/or LO go over to see her I get pretty anxious, and get pretty obsessive the next few days. He doesn't seem to understand that being mind-fucked and played by her that whole time, while also being told by him, and the rest of his family that it's not a big deal, she is just like this, she isn't being malicious etc (you know the drill), then finally snapping, cutting her off, then her targeting others, everyone else realizing you were not the problem, finally validating you, leaves you with some emotional baggage. He won't validate my feelings because it hurts him and I get that. But I told him I would respect his boundary of not tearing down his mom to him, if he could appreciate she messed me up. 

So here I am, with this new event, and I'm upset, so without telling him I am going to post. It should be ok because it doesn't have real details about our history and isn't click bait worthy. But I have to lay down some thick history, so I'm sorry this is so long.

About 3 years ago I got even more sick than I already was. Enough that I got referral to a neurologist and they were concerned enough to send me for a few tests, and a MRI. they found a brain tumor. The position, size and shape suggested it is a lipoma. They are a fatty mass that grows slowly and typically do not cause issues. But we had to 1. Make sure it was not hiding anything by doing a CT scan. And 2. Follow up with another MRI in a year, than 3 than 5 etc to monitor its growth. They can grow, or cause issues. I will have to be monitored for the rest of my life. But to be clear, people live their whole lives not knowing they have these. I could have been born with it. But at this point we don't know if my little 6mm brain bean is hiding a secret or not. And it's coming up on Christmas at this point...

Now MIL has, for DH and my whole relationship, ruined christmas. She is the typical narc. She demands that she gets her way. My family doesn't exist. She pitches fits. If you have been around this sub you know the typical shit these women pull. 

There was an ongoing power play she was pulling with me for the previous 3 christmases (brain tumor Christmas being the 4th), that she was doing, where she was copying a tradition I had started. So let's say the tradition is that I started over a decade before was that I gifted everyone custom made bath bombs (it's not at all that but let's just go with that). 
Everyone in the family loves them, raves about them, starts talking about them in November. Asks me to make specific ones for them. Then MIL starts making THE EXACT SAME THING. Same packaging, same scents, same boxes and everything.  I am shocked the first year, not just because it's an exact copy, but also because MIL makes lotions AND bubble baths for everyone already. So why does she need to add scented bath bombs to the mix? I specifically picked bath bombs all those years ago because no one was making them, and I'm damn good at making scented bath bombs. So after Christmas I confront her. Because I have a shiny spine and I was raised to speak my mind. She acts surprised. Says oh well I won't make the one kind of bath bomb next year, but you can never have enough bath stuff.. um yes you can, it takes away from it all, but it upsets me that you copied my tradition I started. I'm a young adult and am establishing my own traditions that will mean something, just like you have your own. 

The following year she leaves out one bath bomb, but still makes others, I tell her again I am upset. Try to get through to her. She now enlists FIL and I hear through the grape vine that is my younger SIL that I am a spoiled brat, I don't own bath bombs, and I need to get over it. 

The third yeah, prior to Christmas the slur champagne starts against me. My BIL's wife contacts me upset, her boys have made and decorated bath bombs to hand out as gifts. Am I going to be upset about that too? Um no, that's adorable. MIL isnt doing that. Also MIL ups the game and copies the EXACT SAME ornaments I had made the previous 2 year with LO, but with all her grandkids and hands them out. So now there is this weird duplicate thing going on. I didn't come up with the idea, I took it off of pinterest, but damn MIL just get a different idea off pinterest yourself! So DH and I decide to talk to her together, and she DARVOs , FIL gets pissed, it's a whole thing. 

The fourth year my DH is pissed, this is the year my brain tumor is looming, so we are stressed as hell. We don't know what news is waiting. I just want a nice Christmas. I ask DH to tell his mom to not make bath bombs period. She says too bad. He explains how much it upsets me, that my feelings are hurt that she keeps doing this. She replies with, and I quote ""I don't care about (magpies) feelings."" This was the first time in the 20 some of years she has ever said something like this. He has always said all her actions were not malicious. This flies in the face of that. He instantly calls her because he is so upset. He lets it slip about my brain tumor, while he is scolding her. SHE STILL MAKES THE BATHBOMBS THAT CHRISTMAS. 

So at that Christmas gathering, we decided to tell everyone the news. We were all gathered, it was easier to tell them the news instead of calling them all separately, andro answer everyone's questions. So we explain it like I explained it to you. It was hard. We also explained that we did not want the news leaving that house. No one else was to be told. I did not want any phone calls, with questions that I did not have answers to. I did not want to spend Christmas break, with my LO, hiding from LO, crying on the phone,  comforting extended family telling them ""I don't know, I don't have answers yet."" Everyone was very understanding of that request. When we said we were sorry about breaking this news at Christmas. They all understood, and I did not want endless attention for this. 

The very next day I get a face chat call from MIL sister, and she instantly asks about my brain tumor. But she asks about my brain cancer. When I'm having brain surgery. My MIL didn't even go 24 hours before she told someone. She called her sister, and told her about her own medical stuff she found out. Her sister didn't think it was a big deal as she had had the same issues a few years before so MIL didn't get the drama reaction she wanted, so she says ""Oh, -sigh- have you heard from Magpie today?"" And then exaggerated what we had told her. When AIL called she thought I was diagnosed with brain cancer and waiting for a surgery date for surgery.

She couldn't respect my privacy. She used my private information, to get a reaction out of someone, to fulfill her need for drama and gossip. That was it. I was done. She said she didn't care about my feelings, knew I was having a very hard and scary Christmas, still made the bath bombs, and then followed it all up with that. I haven't talked to her since. The following two christmases we haven't spent with MIL. She is very upset about that. Play bitch games, win bitch prizes. But apparently the prize didn't make enough of an impact.

She did it again, to her GC daughter, who is very much like her. My SILs (1,2&amp;3) are much younger than us 1 is estranged from 2&amp;3. 1 calls me very upset. Tells me MIL called, 2 is unexpectedly pregnant. Is super sick, upset, and scared. 3 isn't talking to 2 because she is pissed that 2 is pregnant. 2 was very vocal about 1's recent unplanned pregnancy, calling her a bunch of nasty names. So 3 thinks 2 is a hypocrite now. MIL says 2 wants to talk to 1 because she feels so alone!! 

It's all bullshit. MIL wants so badly to get 1,2&amp;3 back together again. She wants the perfect, close family. But they won't ever be. 1 knows she messed up big time (she is a recovered drug addict, and spent many years being a very horrible person, but has worked very hard the last few years to do good and stay clean), and knows MIL is telling her all this private info against 2's wishes. MIL is distraught because she says 2 doesn't know what she is going to do with the pregnancy. 

So let's recap. MIL has pushed DH away and hates that she doesn't see us for holidays, because she shared my personal information. She knows that's why I, among other things, went NC. She then goes and tells 1, 2's extremely private information. 2 doesn't even know if she is keeping the pregnancy. 1 knows that 2 is going to be pissed at her (1) for just knowing this info (yes that is how strained the relationship is). So 1 is super upset, calls me to vent, and that is how I find out that 2 is pregnant, days after 2 finds out. Even though 2 and I hardly ever speak. 

This happened 2 months ago. I so badly want to tell 2, but it will just hurt 1 and 2's relationship. It just fills me with rage that MIL is still doing this. It makes me so made that I can't rant and rave at DH and get it through to him. But it hurts him so much. The only comfort I have is that my LO who is 10, is already seeing through my MIL's shit and is putting some distance in. DH is pulling away too, so it will work out fine, that we will basically be NC by the time LO has private info.  The other nice thing is when I found out I told BIL's wife that I had very private information I shouldn't have, and it will come out eventually, or maybe not, and if it does we need to talk. So at least I have proof I knew about this long ago, and can prove that MIL can't be trusted with personal information.  I hope she takes the info seriously, and maybe they start distancing themselves from the dark void that is MIL.

I'm so sorry this was so long. I couldn't break it up, because I don't want a bunch of posts about my MIL. Thank you for letting me rant. I'm just here to get it off my chest and feel validated. I know MIL is horrible, but I just feel better hearing it from other people that I'm right in thinking so. Thank you.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi Llama’s, I am at a loss on what to do with my FMIL. You may of seen from my previous post FMIL has cancer and continues to get herself in debt and borrow from my OH. Cancer is now nearly gone and she is finishing up her treatment, she has now realised that all the bridges she burnt are gone after she thought she was dying. Narc now scrabbling for control after pissing everyone off, I swear she thought she was going to die and wanted us all to live with the guilt. Maybe im wrong but that’s the only reason I can think off her actively pissing everyone off and continuing to get into more debt.
 
Now we have since found out FMIL was lying about the debt and was actually using the money for her spending addiction with shopping channels. As all Justno’s seem to be, she is terrible at buying presents. They are all of shopping channels and one year sent my OH (Other half) a box of pies. Since finding out about the lies obviously OH has not said anything to her as she is paying him back monthly and he needs the money currently so sadly he has to be nice.
 
On the plus side he has agreed he will not lend her money ever again after me reading him the narc playlist and discussing everyone’s comments on here. He is slowly coming out of the fog but as we know hard to change the years of training from FMIL tears and manipulations.
 
So onto where I come in. Now me and FMIL have not spoken in 8 months since her visit where she abused me and spent 3 weeks crying then tried to spilt us up with lying that I was abusive to her. Got so bad I had to record the times when I was alone to prove to OH I was not being horrible to her. Not going to lie N/C has been amazing, as I have my own family crazy to deal with.
 
I have previously been abused and this set off a lot of my triggers and I have had therapy to deal with the aftermath of her visit and finally feeling better with my mental health.  Even though she is 3000 miles away the narc knows that its time to pounce.
 
After the conversation of OH saying he cannot lend her any more money, she then calls the next day. Asking him why I will not talk to her, he said he will speak to me. Apparently. Happy Valentine’s Day text was her making effort. 
 
Now for months I wanted to tell her the reasons but OH told me there is no point as she will not listen and just make excuses. Now  this usually the time of year she plans her trip to visit him. He now miraculously changes his mind as she is well enough now for us to try to make amends.
 
She then send me the worst narc apology starting with saying how ill she has been and she is sorry for offending me. Thank you to everyone on here who helped me write the best response to her. Basically telling her that is not an apology and she obviously doesn’t see anything wrong with her behaviour and that I was in the wrong for being offended and that I do not feel she will change and I do not want a relationship with her.
 
I discuss this with OH that I am doing this for my mental health and he confirms he understand why I have to do this and that he will stay in L/C.
 
Now of course she went into the night quietly and left us alone to live a happy life. HAHA not a chance, that evening she then calls OH reading out my text to him making it sound as tragic as possible and crying that she does not know what she has done wrong and how can she fix it if she doesn’t know. Blah Blah she is poorly and I’m so mean, You know the usual.
 
Now I’m pissed as rather than stand up for me, he says to her he will speak to me, obviously he does not as he knows I have made my decision but we leave it.  I then get home a few days later to a huge parcel on my door step from QVC, obviously I click straight away its from her, OH says he doesn’t know why. This is already messing with my anxiety.
 
This was a week ago and OH doesn’t mention it, this weekend I ask if he has spoken to her. He says yes and that’s she’s feeling ill again from her treatment, I completely understand that cancer treatment is horrendous after watching close family members have it, but she smokes like a chimney and eats incredibly unhealthy the fact she is alive is a narc miracle, she refused to even take vitamins . She said she sent the biscuits to be nice and wanted us to enjoy them.
 
Now I wanted to return to sender but as they were addressed to OH, couldn’t really. So I gave them to my co-workers which she would hate that her baby didn’t get his treats, she actually counted how many pieces of chocolate I gave him when she was here. She also says to him again about needing to know what she did wrong.
 
We have an argument as OH tells me he hates talking about it and makes him anxious to bring it up to me as I get angry. Il admit I did at first as my mind couldn’t cope, however since you guys and my therapist I feel rather calm about it all. We rediscuss the narc playbook and is basically word for word the conversations they have and how it will not change and just because he is ok being abused I am not.  
 
 
Now he still wants me to list to her what she did, as we know there is no point. Please help? I have no idea what to expect next, we all know it will get worse. Luckily she is not in this country and cannot just turn up but how do I get this women to leave me alone when she wants to stay in my house? 

This will never happen again, this will be my hill to die on and OH knows this but needs to keep her from a huge blow up so she continues to pay back the money she owes him.  Do you think I should tell her or continue to ignore her?",JUSTNOMIL

"I recently had my first kid and my mom is going on and on about how shes gonna take him on vacation and how he's gonna stay the night at her place soon.

That is never going to happend. Her husband, my stephdad, is an angry man. He always was a cunt towards me when I was still living at home. He is not always like this, but when he is, Im legit scared of him. He has never put his hands on me, but he has come close and it wouldn't surprise me if he is the kind of guy who is capable of it.

Whenever he is around kids, his fuse to anger gets shorter. He can't handle kids screaming, being noisy, being hard, being kids in general. He looses his mind. I once heard him call his own grandson a demon.

He is not all bad. I'll give him that. He is, looking away from his anger issues, an ok man. But he owes me alot of apologies, and i've never gotten one. To me, that just shows he hasen't changed a bit since I moved out.

THIS is the reason i don't want my child to go over and spend the night. And i defenitly don't want him to go in vacation with them.

I need to tell my mom this. I know she is going to act out. She is going to be mad/sad and play the victim. She's gonna drag my brothers intoo this. She's gonna make a scene. I honestly think her reactions is gonna be awful, like trying to guilt trip me.

How should I break the news to her?

"I realize that it may be common to not love your in laws, and its OK to not want to be best friends or hang out with them. I am in my first relationship, and my boyfriends mom has been very overbearing, and somewhat rude to me. I won't get into the details. My boyfriend has had to cut his family off before, and he didn't talk to them for a few years after he moved out but he has since rekindled things and lives back home (soon to move out again, but under positive circumstances).  He is very family oriented and loves his family, I would never be the one to ask he separate from them if he chooses to do so that would be his choice.  At first I thought he was a mama's boy given her behavior and the way he described their relationship, but after talking about it and voicing my concerns he has addressed every issue and proven to me that he is willing to set boundaries and stand up to her/tell her off when she does something that is crossing the line.

I come from a less than ideal home myself, and wonder if its wrong to not want to deal with another persons toxic family behavior long term. But, I do want to be with my boyfriend and this may just be something that comes along. Aside from his family, everything else is great. He hasn't done anything wrong, I feel selfish for even thinking this way. Broken homes are common, dysfunctional families are common. I'm very grateful, and surprised that he has actually taken my concerns seriously.

I guess my question is, I have only been with him 7 months so far, for those of you who are married or in long term relationships do you think it is worth the added stress of still having to associate with and deal with their family? Assuming your significant other does listen to your concerns and is willing to stand up for you. Sometimes I think it would be nice to just not have to deal with this at all, but if it wasn't this it would be something else, no person comes without baggage myself included.

"Hey everyone, 

I want to thank you all for your kind words and concern. You all had wonderful ideas and truly helped me get to a better place in my mind. You all know how damaging this kind of abuse can be and I wanted to just take a moment to thank you for being there. Now, on to the update. 

Yesterday, D(ear)H was finally able to talk to the hiring manager. She let him know that JNMIL had one interview, not three and that she was not sure who was on the hiring list yet. She told him to check back and see every few days.

DH let this boss know that we are estranged from her. He told them about the stalking and that she did not want him to get married. He mentioned the abuse and harrassment and that he felt it was necessary he tell them that they could potentially be bringing this into their work place. The boss listened intently and did not brush off his concerns, but let him know that there was nothing that could be done. 

They said that IF she got the job and harrassment was taking place, then DH would have to go through HR. The post office has a 90 day probation period and his boss told him that if anything were to happen in those 90 days she would easily be fired. 

So, we unblocked her phone number so that we would have evidence if something happened. Within 20 minutes of unblocking she sent him a picture of a list of 20 emotionally abusive and manipulative behaviors, stating that I do all of those things to him. We did not respond and do not plan on responding to ANY of her messages, but we need that line open to receive that harrassment for a case against her if she gets a job. 

We are currently working on compiling all of the harrassment in an easy to read, chronological folder on our computer. 

I asked the lawyer about a threat letter, he said those hold no value other than the paper they are printed on. DH fears that if we sent one, things would escalate and he even said that he fears if he got a RO that she would escalate even more. It's not that he's not open to it or doesn't want to, it's just that he fears what she might do. We know that the RO would have legal implications, but we are not sure if they would stop her as she seems determined to get contact by any means necessary. Also, his brother (who lives with his mom) is not mentally stable, he sexually harasses women and has a sex addiction- police have been involved. DH fears that his mom is warping his brother's mind about me and does not want them to both just flip. He thinks legal action could do it and I am not convinced otherwise. 

We are weighing all of our options and would love more feedback. We are trying to remain positive and focus on this in a logical, emotionless manner (other than the fear of 'what if').",JUSTNOMIL
"I am pregnant and both my husband and I are extremely excited! However, we are both NC with my JNMIL and both of his half siblings for over a year, which makes me nervous about future issues that could arise.  My husband is still VLC with his father. 

A few examples of things I have seen happen over the years that make me nervous:

My husband and I found out that his brother and SIL were pregnant from JNMIL’s facebook announcement. She announced to everyone via Facebook before they had the chance to call or post anything themselves. 

Apparently my JNMIL was banging on the door and trying to sneak into the room and my SIL was trying to deliver both child. The hospital had to get involved and it was a mess. 

When I was hospitalized, JNMIL came to visit and pulled off my sheet to look at my surgery scars in front of other family. 

I’ve seen my JNMIL stick dirty hands in the mouths of babies, disregard children’s parents, and even to their grandchildren out of their parents arms.   If JNMIL gets upset, FIL will give the child to her since he has no spine. 

The first issue is that my husband wants to tell his father in person before sharing the news with any other family or friends, however I think there’s a very high chance by telling him that my JNMIL is going to share the news with everyone before we get the chance. Since this is our first and it would still be early, I explained why this would really upset me, however he doesn’t seem to understand. His compromise was calling anyone that I want to make sure hear from us, like an hour before telling FIL. 

I have explained to my D(ear) husband many times that both myself and any future children will remain NC with my JNMIL and his siblings. Even FIL will only have contact at our house, since he’s proved many times that he will not anything JNMIL wants to make her happy. My husband agreed to all of this with no problem. However we have not had to navigate any extended family events with JNMIL  (we typically do not go) and are not sure how to do so going forward? Unfortunately JNMIL is prone to public displays for attention and making things extremely uncomfortable. Since a large amount of my DH’s extended family having baby rabies and are going to be over the moon with another baby around, so they will likely be upset if we do not show up to things? Do we continue to not attend? How do we explain to extended family that we cannot risk the safety of our children? 

Also not sure if we should tell people a later due date to decrease the chances of unwanted visitors? Also, what type of questions to ask the hospital to make sure that unwanted guests do not try and visit? 

I have spent the last few weeks reading through the feed for advice, to come up with a plan of attack but haven’t found many posts about these things.",JUSTNOMIL
"My MIL has been overbearing, rude, and just mean since my husband and I got engaged several years ago.  Thankfully she lives two hours away so we don’t see her often, but it’s still ridiculous and I hate it.

My husband’s cousin (who lives out of state) is pregnant.  They decided to fly in next month so the family could host a baby shower for her.  My MIL has to drive through my town to get to the baby shower, which is an hour on the other side of me.

We were with MIL this weekend for a family event.  She asked if I wanted to ride with her, my two sisters-in-law (who she very clearly favors over me and my husband) and my niece to the shower.  I’m not fond of MIL 100% of the time, but she does have her good moments.  I was kind of thankful that she asked because I have horrible anxiety when driving to areas that I’ve never driven to before and I was excited to spend some time with my sisters-in-law.  I told her I would like that and plans were made.

This morning I texted her to let her know what I bought for the baby so she could text the others (there’s no registry so everyone has been sharing what they’ve bought to avoid duplicates).  She texted me back that her husband has decided to come with everyone to see other family members on the day of the baby shower.  She said that meant that there wouldn’t be room for me in their car so I would need to drive my own car by myself.

My husband has other plans that day so he can’t ride with me.  On one hand, I’m thinking yeah, it’s fair that FIL wants to go visit others.  On the other hand, I’m hurt that I was basically kicked out of the carpool and wish she would have checked with him first before asking if I wanted to ride with them.",JUSTNOMIL
"I just got out of the hospital a few days ago b/c I'm 21 wks pregnant and I went into labor. I'm on bed rest for the next 2.5 weeks (and counting).  I can only get up to go to the bathroom or Shower w cannot exceed 30 min.  My fiance and I got the restraining order bc she kept calling me and telling me I was a whore, a sell-out, a gold digger, because my husband is white, I am black, and he is very very well off. I make 90k on my own as a dental hygienist and have never asked my fiance for money and have always taken care of me since high school.  She also doesn't like that he is twice my age I am 24 he is 46.  My friends and my nana love him and think we are great together.  She looks at me as though I'm her property and has told me such.   


Just A Back Story  
She says that b/c she raised me I owe her.  Before I and my fiance met, I had to sneak to move out. I literally had to move outfits two at a  time to a storage facility.  I had two cell phones. One on her plan and one on my own that I would turn off and leave in my car ( that she also didn't know about) that I would park 4 blocks away in a closed parking lot so she wouldn't know I had one.  She wanted me to live with her forever.   She thought I should wash and cook and clean up after her like a maid b/c she took care of me as an infant.  I had basically been her slave until I moved out.  I hide my mail I had to go to one of those places where you can get a P.O. box but its a regular street address.  So she wouldn't get my bank info, or my info on my car note, etc.  So when I finally moved out my God-Mother had to intervene and told her that she was going to push me away if she didn't let grow up. So fast forward to me meeting my fiance w/ was about six months after I moved out.  We waited for almost a year to tell her though everyone else in our lives was aware that we were together. She blew up and was like over my dead body!!! I told her this was my life and if she didn't like it, she didn't have to be a part of it.  She slapped me into a wall.   I pushed her out of my apartment and locked the door, the concierge made her leave as my apartment was on the first floor right around the corner from his desk.  

&amp;#x200B;

She basically would show up from time to time wherever we were and she has gotten into verbal altercations with him and my fiance does not back down. So fast forward to me being in the hospital, I was at work and on lunch and she called me and was saying that I make her sick and what a whore I am. I started crying and then I felt all this pain in my lower abdomen.  I then collapsed and everyone called an ambulance. Long story short gave me some treatments w/ worked and kept me in the hospital. She found out b/c the new girl didn't know the situation and called her and told her I was taken to the hospital. She showed up and tried to get my fiance ousted as she is the next of kin.  However, I was fully awake and told them that I wanted her to leave. They had me sign a healthcare proxy, where I deemed my fiance my caretaker in the event I cannot make decisions for myself.   This was where my fiance suggested a restraining order, so she couldn't contact me anymore or come within 1000 feet of me; as she is detrimental to my health and the baby's health.   The restraining order is only until Oct 3, the baby is due September 30.  I'm nervous, my husband is suggested we move to the west coast, I'm afraid to do that honestly I've never lived anywhere but NYC.  But this might be the best decision for the safest decision for our growing family. What do you think? I'm sorry if I'm all over the place I so have pregnancy brain and I also wanted to give you guys some background on how she is.

"Hey guys! It’s been a while. Here’s a little diddy:

So, my fiancé is making a lot of strides in his career and I’m so proud of him. He’s a teacher, and submitted his project to get his teaching licensure months back, and was waiting for results.

My fiancé does not work on Fridays, and Louise will call him on those days to chat and talk at him. While he was on the phone with her, he checked to see if his results were back.

He’d passed! He texted me right after and told me the great news. I was elated and so excited for him! He sent the good news to the group chat with Louise, his dad, his brother and his sister and her husband.

Louise sends to the chat: Haha everyone! I knew before you! 

Honestly, I don’t care that she knew first. What irritated me was that she made this exciting moment about her and how she knew first, as opposed to this incredible success that my fiancé had in his career.

I expressed this to my fiancé, and he told her that it was inappropriate and a little childish. 

She called me to apologize, stating that I should have known first and she’s so sorry, under the impression that I was upset because she knew before me. I expressed that I didn’t care, and I was glad he shared that moment with her, but it was upsetting that instead of congratulating him, she made it about how she knew first. 

She said “Oh well I was just excited because I was able to keep it to myself before he told everyone.” 

So, she tried to say that it was SUCH A LARGE FEAT that she was able to keep this exciting event a secret for a WHOLE TEN MINUTES for him to tell me and the group chat. 

I don’t know that it’s true, I think she was rubbing it in that she knew first and wanted to hijack the moment to make it about her. 

But fine, I tried to explain that it was his moment and it should have been about congratulating him, not some WILD FEAT of keeping a secret for ten minutes.

She didn’t understand, and then ranted about how she’s been stressed because she has gout? I guess? And she’s got an iron deficiency. 

So, nothing changed, she made the conversation about her, and the universe continues to revolve around her.

"This is a long old story with a new short new story at the bottom. So I'll try and keep it short which means I'll have to skip details. Also typed on mobile.

First story, 8 years ago my sister was in a bad long distance relationship with a guy both early 20s. She was in the UK, he was in America and I was in Australia. 

She told us she was going to Paris for a Uni trip. I'd been several times before when I lived in the UK, so my mum called me and said 'sis says she is in Paris but I think she has gone to see her bf in America' then she asked me to call sis and ask her about Paris and verify if she was there (so I guess this is me being a FM?). I called sis and asked her what she had seen and it was obvious she was lying. So I relayed that to mum. 

Fast forward a few months, I'm visiting the UK and sis borrowed my favourite top so I look for it from her cupboard and out pops travel docs for America right next to my top, I couldn't help reading (snooping). So I showed my mom and we put it back where I found it. 

Some how sis knew we had been in her cupboard and went crazy at me, her point was if our mum knew where she was the whole time, why was it any of my business. Which is absolutely true, but my mum had told me she didn't know sis had gone to America but only suspected it and that she was stressed about my sisters safety and sanity etc 

We had this argument out in front of our mum, so I turned to mum for back up, 'mum you didn't know she was in America did you?' She looked like a deer caught in the headlights and that was when I realised what a liar she was. The FOG lifted a lot that day. 

I tried to explain to sis how mum had lied to me but she was just crazed at that point, mum basically pitted us against each other. A month later was my wedding, I should have had my sister by my side for that last month but I feel mum ruined that for us. 

Months later when I had returned home to Aus, I tried to explain all the above to my sister again and she was finally calm enough to discuss and understand the lie I had been told by mum. She was shocked too. We've made a promise to each other since to always tell one another what mum has said to us about the other. It's worked out really well, my mum chats a lot of crap about my sister and regularly paints her as a villain. This openness has bought sis and I closer.

I tried talking to my mum back then to get answers, why did she lie to me and say that she SUSPECTED sis was in America when she KNEW that she was. She kept getting hysterical and hanging up on me so after the third conversation trying I gave up. But after that day I took anything she said with a pinch of salt and always verified the facts if needed.

Cue to earlier this year, we took an online DNA test and I found my dad was not my bio dad. My dad doesn't know. Another sibling got the same result and wants me there in person to confront mum which has meant waiting until I visit the UK, it's already been 3 excruciating months and it'll be at least another 3 before I go over. Mum has already noticed that I no longer call her, when she calls me I just make pleasantries and give the phone to my kids - if I answer, some days I just can't, I just don't want to.  My sibling is saying that by confronting mum from Aus, I'm creating drama for them without being in it. Why would I want to be anywhere near the drama or my mother after this conversation? I'm not going to stick around in her home like I normally would.

Also thinking back on how she acted hysterical and would hang up on me, when I confronted her about the lies to do with my sister, I think I won't get the truth from her about the affair that resulted in me. I have questions I need answered like why did she trap my dad if she was pregnant with me, why didn't she treat him better, was she so wrapped up in her affair that she didn't realise a relative was abusing me, if my bio paternal grandmother who lives around the corner from her knows, so many many questions. 

I miss the days I used to wonder why she lied about my sister, feeling frustrated that I will never know why mum lied to me so unnecessarily and now that doesn't even matter. Other days I crave reaching out to my half brother and saying hey, but I can't because it would get back to my dad.

So my wise new friends on reddit my question to you are, 
- Why do you think she lied about not knowing that my sis was in America 
- do I push for confrontation asap knowing it's likely I don't get answers
- do I let it all just go and put her on vvvvvLC, NC is not an option as I'd like to keep in touch with dad and siblings and they live with her, if I don't acknowledge her when speaking to them, dad will get suss 

Also please this is not a conversation about dad having a right to know or how I came to any conclusions or that online tests are a scam 

Thanking you all for taking the time to read my lengthy post

"My baby spilled some juice just now , a small puddle of it . It's not like it's some terrible horrifying thing that just happened. It's just some liquids , just mop it up and it's gone right ? It's not a big deal at all.

Like ya I'm listening to some music while walking around the house but that's it. Its not like I have anything  else I'm allowed to do , except use my ph to pass the time here while your imposing your self isolation lifestyle on me.  Maybe actually let me do something that's not eating, sleeping, using my ph and  staring at walls  hmmm. Or let me step out the house for once or let me talk to people and make friends . Or stop controlling and limitimg my everymove , making me need to ask permission for any and everything I do,  from the most basic things like getting a glass cup out to drink some water (I'm 22 not a teen or a child or a toddler  guys ) . Maybe then I'll stop using the pH as a clutch to escape reality , but until then this is my only window to the outside world and source of entertainment so yes , I'm going to damn well use it.

"Background: DH was discharged from the military in September, and we’ve both been looking for jobs since. I’m also in school, and DH is starting school in the fall. 

Two weeks ago I got an interview after trying to find a job for months, and was hired on the spot. With my various back issues including scoliosis and the strain of Huge Titties TM, I knew it wasn’t going to be a good time, as its food service and standing all day, but I had to suck it up. I signed on for part time, they put me on the schedule for 6hr shifts every day for the last two weeks. No time for school work. I got overwhelmed really, really quickly, but what can you do.

So today, I called Lyric Bitch to catch up, and she asked how work was and I was honest, I said it was really difficult and I was overwhelmed. She blows it off, and goes, “oh you’ll be fine, learn to manage your time better. This is just motivation for you to continue your education!” So... now that I have a job it’s not good enough, even when that’s all she used to talk about. Got it. Then she asked how school was, and I was honest, that I was slipping due to my workload not giving me time for school. Instead of “hey I’m sorry things are hard for you,” or even something remotely encouraging, she just very flatly goes, “Well. At least you’re a fast reader. That’s all there is to it right?” 

I’m sorry, does she think I’m in third fucking grade? No that is not “all there is to it.” I got off the phone in a hurry, and I’m just sad now. I feel like she’s not taking anything I’m doing seriously. Meanwhile, she’s never done a food service or other minimum wage job in her life. I just wanted her to reassure me. Or something.

While later I was trying to get him to say ""I love you, mama"". He is very talkative for a 2 year old but this one has taken a lot of practice and he still only says it seldom. Well JustNo starts yelling over me to try to get him to say ""I love grandma"". I tell her to stop a few times and she continues. Just yelling that over me while I'm still trying to get him to say it. Then she acts like her feelings are so hurt when I yelled at her to stop. I just don't get where this entitlement comes from? 

Just a little rant, but I'm thinking about going less contact, or at least cutting out unsupervised visits (he stays overnight semi often) since she does this to my face what is she doing when I'm not around?",JUSTNOMIL
"Has anyone thought ahead to the time when you'll be a MIL and what to do or not? My kids are 26 and 23, no signs yet but you never know. Therefore, my thoughts...

Per my first mother in law, fondly christened Moogie, I will NOT start my acquaintaince with my son's GF by telling her she looks like a hooker for wearing a red tshirt.(Baggy one, at that!)

When my son is getting married, I will not be calling and asking if I can bring 9 (!) people including the groom to stay at the bride's home during the wedding weekend. The house had barely enough chairs for that many people. leave alone beds, and we were doing some of the pics at the house the wedding morning. (no, Moogie and co. didn't stay at the house.)

Nor will I tell my DIL that I refuse to use a carseat, and she cannot tell me I must, because I am the grandmother, and I outrank her.

I most certainly will not demand that my son give me money to pay my bills every month and not tell his wife he did so.

Nor will I tell my old biddy church friends that my DIL cannot cook and does not ever help with anything when they visit. Only to have said old biddies show up unannounced at the house in the middle of my DIL cooking BBQ for 15 people singlehanded.  Because that's what happened to Moogie who then had to listen to her other son explain to the biddies that I had volunteered to give MIL a break.  (I gave them ribs to take with)

I have sworn that I will not do what my dad's mother did either. She tried to pick out a wife for Dad. (he didn't let her) then she tried to get my parent's wedding cancelled by calling the church secretary and taking it off the books. When that failed, dad's mother spent the next 30 years till she died trying to get them divorced. I'm pretty sure it's dirty pool to offer your son money for divorce lawyers as well as to demand he sign custody of his children over to his mother because clearly she thought both my parents were too stupid to raise kids.

I do intend to be kind, available and patient, offer advice only when asked and to be gracious whenever I am invited into their lives. Sound good?",JUSTNOMIL
"**TW: Animal abuse, animal deaths.**

I have written about my JNMom, Narcisa, at the JustNoFamily subreddit a couple times (Mostly because of threats against my brother and father), but recently I remembered this particular event because of some conversations with an aunt about why even if I wasn't NC with Narcisa I would never allow her around any pets or children of mine.

First, a bit of context: I'm not American nor an English-speaker, so forgive any mistakes. I'm actually from a shithole called Venezuela (Posted about it in JNF, no point in hiding it) so I come from a latin dictatorship with all that implies. My JNMom, Narcisa, is your average latin narc: A religious zealout using god as a sockpuppet and people as tools, two faced, controlling, prejudiced, prone to anger issues and also in the last 10-12 years had increasing abuse of prescription meds and alcohol. My dad divorced her a while ago (My brother and I later discovered she had cheated on him and just wanted to be with her boytoy) and my brother was the GC for a long while because he's non-confrontational by nature, but is long out of the FOG and now sees her as she is. We both left the continent and live in safer countries now because we wanted to flee the dictatorship and to be rid of Narcisa once and for all.

**There's a TL;DR at the end, since this will be long.**

\---

Now, for the story itself:

Growing up I used to have a lot of animals at home, we're talking dozens of birds, cats, the odd dog, rabbits, turtles, etc. My dad's home was huge and the backyard was basically a jungle and it being in the tropics made it so that stuff like parrots flying around in the afternoon was a normal sight.

My mother got a cat, let's call her Mimi, when I was around 6. Mimi lived for 13-14 years before passing away, not without having at least 9 litters of kitties, all of which were given to stores or adoption places so they could be given away because my mom didn't think it was worth it to neuter the cat until she developed health issues in her old age.

We never kept any of the kitties after they kept dying because my mom decided they should share food bowls with a large dog, which just ended in the cats becoming chew toys. When called out on this she decided that we didn't know better because she was an authority on animals so 'as punishment' we wouldn't keep more kitties. (To be fair, the only one that survived all that was stolen by Jehova's Witnesses, but that's another story entirely and afaik the cat at least was cared for).

Before you ask no, animal support groups are basically powerless in that place and no, I couldn't have taken Mimi there for neutering or to a vet because the country has always been unsafe enough to warrant moving by car everywhere (and she'd was always too tired or busy to take Mimi).

I didn't think much or this not realize this was neglect (despite dozens of animals dying under her care) until we got dogs and one of the female dogs developed some kind of uterus issue due to not being neutered that made her cry as she walked, thus hysterectomy ensued. During all this my mom was in her usual *""oh well shit happens, they're animals""* mode and by then I was realizing she just liked animals for the noise and wanted to put zero effort into their training or care (My dad and grandpa were the ones in charge of feeding and cleaning, my brother and I bathed the animals, etc).

Around this time Mimi dies from some undiagnosed disease (she was coughing blood, refused to eat and couldn't keep food down). Narcisa makes me be present while Mimi dies in front of her, makes a pity party, then she's 'fine' 30 mins later and orders my brother and father to go bury Mimi somewhere, just not in the house.

The next few weeks she would make these sudden dramatic scenes with long sighing and wistful staring into the distance about how she's '*never have another pet again*'. Around this time I finally had gotten a puppy of my own (Let's call him Fidel) and I cared for him a lot, had to bottlefeed him because somehow he was too small for soft kibble. My mother notices the puppy is growing up and how I discipline him, also how protective Fidel was of me.

So she decides when Fidel is about 8 months to go and get a puppy from the very exact same breed as Fidel so it can be '*her baby*' and give her a related name to Fidel's (Let's call her Mirta). Now, I don't think animals are inherently evil or capable of being bad in the human sense of the word, but I'm a firm believer of animals taking traits and behaviour from their owners, which in Mirta's case manifested in an inmense entitlement over everything any other animal owned, being obnoxiously loud, barking and throwing crying fits if ignored, biting people, etc.

At this point Mimi, much like every other deceased animal and person in her life, stopped popping in her conversations unless it suited the narrative of the moment or she needed to victimize herself.

My brother and I really like animals so we tolerated Mirta's antics and tried to keep her out of trouble. We also sometimes tried to care for stray animals before letting them go since we couldn't keep them, at this point enters the story a malnourished stray kitty we find in our porch, let's call her Basil. Basil was very small and weak, also very mistrustful of humans much like stray kittens are wont to be.

It took awhile of leaving food for her until she allowed herself to be touched, much less grabbed, so we could check her status and see if she was missing anything or needed anything. (Other than a minor eye infection and being gaunt she was fine).

Basil turns out to be very affectionate and sweet, and starts dropping by the porch very often to see if we put out food or to get pets, by now the novelty of Mirta's had worn off for Narcisa, and other than having her as a purse accesory the dog was left to her own devices to wreak havoc around the house. Narcisa notices Basil and instantly goes into the spiel of '*I said I wouldn't have another pet or cat again so shoo that cat away*', eventually we call her out on her hipocrisy and even my dad has taken a liking to Basil, so she decides to 'give her a chance'.

It didn't take long for Basil to become Mimi 2.0, as in spoiled, pampered by Narcisa, she even called her by Mimi's nicknames and tried to teach her to respond like her. She had some of Mimi's toys stored away and tried giving them to Basil, which I found a bit unsettling truth be told.

She had decided Basil would be the New Cat^(tm) but I told her she HAD to neuter the cat so we didn't have a repeat of history. ""Y*es don't worry I'll neuter my baby*"" she said sheepishly at first, then increasinly annoyed once I reminded her weekly of it.

At this point I got a new job but I was working 10-12h a day and was barely at home except for sleeping. I was making 'decent' money and offered to pay for Basil's vet expenses, neutering included. Narcisa obviously would have none of it, being the kind of narc that loves to weaponize money and 'all the things I do for you', knew that letting me pay for that would mean I was taking power from her. *""I SAID I WILL NEUTER MY BABY AND I'LL DO IT WHEN I DO IT*"".

I simply didn't have the time to take the cat to the vet or care for an animal that just had surgery, in hindsight if I had taken some days off that would have prevented the events that unfolded.

One day I notice Basil getting plumper and comment on it to my brother, who agrees she's either fat or pregnant. She begins swelling and it's obvious she's gonna have kitties, by now Narcisa stops slowly doting on Basil slowly until she just acknowledges her presence when she's being loud because she wants milk or food. Mirta goes back to being the Golden Pet, she is by now a small engine of destruction of shoes, doors and anything small.

I confront Narcisa in front of the family on the fact that she said she's take the cat to get neutered and she didn't, now she was pregnant as a consequence of her inability to keep her word.

""*WELL I was GOING to get her neutered BUT THEN SHE WENT AND GOT PREGNANT AND THERE'S NOTHING TO BE DONE ABOUT IT. I'll neuter her after she has the kittens, it's not my fault she got pregnant!*""

Narcisa decides that Basil should live in the backyard now and will be allowed to nest there. The kitties are born, a litter of 5 kitties, no stillborns or anything. Basil is a good natural mother even though it's her first time, Narcisa decides she cares about Basil again because *'MUH BAAAAAAAAAAAAAABIES'*.

A bit of time goes by, the kitties have opened their eyes and are starting to learn how to walk without wobbling, they're as lovely as one'd expect and Basil despite being tired is very attentive of them and worries whenever one of them is out of her sight.

One weekend Narcisa goes to the backyard to check on the kitties and she has Mirta with her. Basil obviously gets hissy when a strange dog approaches the place where her kittens are and threatens to attack Mirta, cue Narcisa making a scene about ""*HOW DARE YOU FIGHT YOU SHOULD BE FRIENDS LOOK SHE'S A FRIEND BASIL NO DON'T YOU DARE HISS AT US YOU UNGRATEFUL CAT* ***HOW DARE YOU***"" while Mirta howls a storm and whimpers like she's dying, dramatic as the owner.

Next week I come back from work one day at 10-11pm and go check on Basil and can't find her anywhere in the backyard. I call her out and there's no response and I can't hear the kitties either. I ask my dad if he's seen Basil and he says he hasn't, but he arrived a bit ago and hadn't checked on the animals yet. I ask my brother and nothing, he was at college the entire afternoon and saw her in the morning.

Then I approach Narcisa, I remember she was smoking and having a beer while watching a movie, much like usual even though we lived together we didn't even greet each other unless we crossed each other's path every 2-3 days so she hadn't even greeted me.

&amp;#x200B;

OP: *Hey Narcisa* (Don't call her mom since I was like 10), *have you seen Basil? I can't seem to find her anywhere.*

Narcisa: *Hm? Basil? Yes, as a matter of fact I have seen her.*

OP: *Oh? Where is she? Did you move her nest or something?*

Narcisa takes a deep puff and lets out a sigh, then looks me in the eye half smiling.

Narcisa: *Today I grabbed two sacks I found in the storage room. I put Basil in one, I put the kitties in the other. You know what I did then?*

(I feel my blood getting cold.)

Narcisa: *I told you I didn't want more cats or pets in my house, so she had to go.*

OP: *WHAT, EXCUSE YOU WHA-*

Narcisa: *Shhh, don't yell at me! Also don't interrupt me, I guess you don't care about where the cat is.*

OP: ***WHERE'S*** *THE CAT*

Narcisa: *I said STOP YELLING AT ME* ***ARE YOU ON DRUGS OR SOMETHING?!*** (Her usual go-to phrase when I yelled, the strongest drug I have ever done is alcohol socially and caffeine at night)

OP: *YOU'RE YELLING TOO*

Narcisa: *I'M NOT YELLING* ***THIS*** *IS MY NORMAL TONE OF VOICE YOU LITTLE SHIT YOU* ***WILL*** *RESPECT ME I AM YOUR* ***MOTHER***\*.\*

(Realizing a screaming match won't get me anywhere) OP: Ok, sure, whatever. Where's the cat?

Narcisa: *Ah yes, haha, it's a funny thing really. Well you know she got pregnant when she shouldn't have, so I couldn't really neuter her, it's her fault really, even when I decided I didn't want to have more pets and allowed her to stay. So well, she had to go. You know \[Dangerous area 20 mins away\]?*

OP: *...Uh-huh.*

Narcisa: *Well... I left the kitties there. Then I drove a bit and left Basil at \[Another place, in a whole another sector\].*

OP: *WHAT, YOU ABANDONED THE KITTIES AWAY FROM BASIL?! THEY CAN'T EVEN WALK PROPERLY YET!*

Narcisa: *Ah don't worry, nature is wise and they'll figure things out, they're animals, that's what they do.*

OP: ..*.Where exactly did you drop them?*

Narcisa: *Dropped them near \[Areas where people collect trash for the trash truck\], I don't know, I'm so tired, are we done here? I'm watching a movie here.*

&amp;#x200B;

I know from experience that fighting won't get me anywhere, and as much as I wanted to slap her I knew she cried ASSAULT if you so much as bumped accidentally on her (even though she loved beating us up when we were small). I take the longest deep breath and try to control myself from doing anything rash, especially since I couldn't even call the police for help.

I call my best friend and pick him up then we go to look for the cats, I explain the situation as I go. Sadly, as it was too late and the places are dangerous we couldn't stay there for long, but we look for the cats for 4-5 hours to no avail.

I continue looking for 3 weeks afterwards, I never found them. I feel still guilty for not taking days off to take Basil to the vet myself.

Knowing Narcisa she probably told me wrong places so I wouldn't find the cats, she's that twisted and knew that if I brought the cats back she'd have to take responsibility, but with them gone there was no proof of her doing anything.

I'm sure the kitties died as they were too small to defend themselves and I never saw Basil again (And hope she survived somehow). I don't really understand her mindset really, whether she trashed them because they weren't 'perfect' anymore like she did with me, or whether it was because the cat defended her offspring from a perceived threat and hissed at her purse dog.

Since that I was territorial with Fidel and she reciprocated by mistreating him when I wasn't about and acting like it was a joke.

I don't really want advice, this happened a long time ago, but it has haunted me since. She told my brother ""*the cat had left and took the kitties*"", he was still the GC and trusted her and just recently learned of this story in detail (Talking with my JYAunt unearthed this memory), then was like ""*well shit, now everything clicks*"".

I have long gone NC with Narcisa, but when we were still in contact I decided that should I have kids or pets I'd never let her close to them as I'll never be able to forget the complete lack of remorse on her face that day as she casually confessed her crime like it was a fun prank, I refuse to expose anyone else to her narcissitic brand of sociopathy.

Even so, this wasn't the straw that broke the camel back, since this is just one of the many awful things she did on a normal basis.

\----

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

Mom neglects animals for decades, several animals die and she thinks it's normal, eventually she decides to split apart a cat and her kittens, essentially killing the kittens, because she suddenly decided she didn't want cats anymore.

"Sigh. So exactly what I always feared happening while I was pregnant has happened in real life. We went to my husbands families house for Memorial Day and it was baby’s first big family gathering...

Thankfully we got there early and only a handful of people were there. I really didn’t mind the two uncles and one cousin holding him. Baby got extremely overwhelmed right away and started crying and none of them cared that they couldn’t really hold him. They all stated how he was young and really needed his mother at this age. Luckily he has a cousin who is only a few months older than him and I am now very good friends with his mother who is also an in-law. We played on the floor quietly with the babies and they were giggling and perfectly happy.

Then, MIL walks in. Comes in like a herd of elephants. Literally screams, “WHERES MY BABY.” And tries to grab him. I immediately put him in the carrier on me and he falls asleep. Cue MIL, loud AF, “WHY IS HE ALWAYS SLEEPING WHEN GRANDMA IS AROUND. GRANDMA WANTS A TURN. HE NEEDS TO SEE HIS GRANDMA.” My eyeballs literally rolled into the back of my head and I went outside with the uncles to get away.

Well it is way too loud and too busy at this house for my baby to sleep. He only sleeps for his naps in the carrier at this point but it’s usually only him and I home all day so he sleeps for a good amount at each nap. He woke up after 15 minutes and most likely because “grandma” kept getting in our personal space and yelling about how cute baby is and trying to put a hat on him and everything else.

So baby wakes up and I run into the room to feed and change him while she is trying to snatch him OUT OF THE CARRIER and follow me to the room. She’s extremely overweight and slow moving so I shut and lock the door before she can make it in. I sat for an extra while after baby was ready just cuddling him before she could swoop in.

I go back out to the main area with everyone and MIL, with her mouth full of food and it falling out of her mouth, “OH YAY. NOW YOU SIT AND EAT GIMME HIM ILL HOLD HIM WHILE YOU EAT.” Snatching him from me. I’m so annoyed but also thinking whatever, I’ll let her get this out of the way now and then he will come back to me until we leave.

In the 10 minutes I am eating she kisses him about 100 times, all over his mouth, face, head, and hands. Like wtf is wrong with people and the obsession of kissing a fucking baby? I swear she did it extra because last time we saw her my husband yelled at her not to kiss him! I practically swallow my food whole and at the exact moment I finish baby starts screaming for me so I run over and in the carrier he goes.

He is finally falling asleep, thank God, but of course that’s not allowed around MIL. She starts trying to put random clothes and stuff that she sewed for him on WHILE HE IS ON MY BODY IN THE CARRIER. I say, “he needs to nap, he is getting overtired now.” She screams in baby talk voice, “NO HES NOT WOOK AT HIM HIS WIDDLE EYES ARE OPEN HE WANTS GWAMMA HE WANTS TO COME OUT WITH GWAMMA.” Guys, she TAKES HIS PACIFIER OUT OF HIS MOUTH while he is drifting to sleep so that he will wake up!!!

I leave the room and go hide in the room where baby’s cousins mom is breastfeeding. We lock the door and talk about how annoying and loud she is with the babies.

We both come out and MIL is waiting at the door. “OH I JUST LOVE HAVING SO MANY BABIES AROUND ME.” Why is she always effing screaming. My baby wakes right up and now he is getting pissed. Husband never gets to deal with baby overtired so I hand him over while we say goodbye. Nice uncle takes baby to give him one last squeeze and MIL tries to take him out of his hands! I hope she saw my facial expression but instead baby saved the day and screamed his head off when she attempted this so uncle handed him back to me.

MIL follows us out to the car and stands 2 inches from my face, breathing bbq food breath down my nostrils and trying to kiss baby. I keep stepping backwards away from her but she doesn’t get it. I put baby in car seat and he starts screaming, red faces, tears and all again because he is beyond overtired. MIL says, “OH HE DOESNT KNOW HIS GRANDMA HE IS AFRAID OF ME YOU GUYS NEED TO STOP KEEPING HIM FROM ME HE NEEDS ME.” I swear my eyeballs hurt from rolling so much today.

We head home and husband finally understands why I am so strict about baby sleeping when he starts to get tired. Baby screamed bloody murder the whole way home and took a full hour to put to bed because he was completely beyond overtired and overstimulated. I told husband that his mother kept trying to wake baby up when he was sleeping but he was so freaked out about baby’s screaming he couldn’t pay attention to me.

We will talk later about the whole situation because now that baby is here I actually like going out to family events. I love that husband has a huge family and a cousin who is perfectly the same age as our baby. I also love now having a good friend there with me who is in the exact same boat as me. I really want to be able to spend holidays together and without issues like today.

MIL is the only one I have a real issue with over there. Well, never mind, FIL smoked a cigarette and then tried to touch baby but I immediately stopped him and then he was embarrassed. But still does no one have any common sense anymore? Don’t kiss a babies face, don’t wake a sleeping baby, why are these simple things so difficult?!",JUSTNOMIL
"My MIL has always been a boundary pusher. I’ve never really had a shiny spine. (I have a lot of stories but I don’t want to ramble) Ever since I had my LO, I’ve been okay with her coming over without asking because at least I could take a nap or get some house work done (mostly because she won’t give me back my damn baby until she leaves) I’m not ungrateful, but she does things without asking and acts like she knows better. 

Well today she texted me a photo of a pack n play saying “we are ready for a sleep over! 😃” 

We’ve never discussed her watching her at her house alone. She lives 2 hours away and my LO is only 2 months. It’s not something I’m comfortable with. I’m not sure how to handle this because if she would have asked, I could have prevented her from buying this for a sleep over that’s not gonna happen. I’m not sure how to handle this.",JUSTNOMIL
"Welp the first year of my little nuggets life is coming to a wrap and we want to celebrate. We’re still debating on whether we want to have a close knit party with just a couple people or a bigger shindig. REGARDLESS, we decided with great naivety that first we would pick a weekend or day that works for the core family we want to be there (our sons grandparents and aunts/uncles) and then we could extent invites from there and if those people could come great, if not that’d be okay too.

Of course, the aunts and my mom get back to me immediately with weekends/days that work for them. But my MIL.... why did I think this would be easy?! She beats around the bush, won’t tell me any times they are free (mind you FIL doesn’t work and MIL works a part time job at a grocery store, so I know all she needs to do is put a request in for a day)... finally I decide to just tell her a date, thinking that’ll be easier for her planning commitment issues. So I tell her July 4th, and ask her to tell me if there are ANY issues with that date because if so we can pick another because we obviously want them to be there. She doesn’t respond... I try FIL, no response from him either.

So my husband decides to try texting her about July 4th. She says “sounds great, I’ll let you know tomorrow”. The next day comes, no answer. He texts again, she says “I don’t know”. He again tells her that if there is any issue with that date to just let us know and we’ll pick another. No response. He tries AGAIN 3 days later, no response. FIL texts my husband a couple days later all peeved saying “the birthday party is July 4th?! That doesn’t work for mom, she might have to work”. My husband is completely at a loss at this point, and tells him we’ve asked her essentially 5 times now if the date works, and if not JUST LET US KNOW so we can pick another. 

So my husband tells FIL to just tell us a date that works for them, literally ANY DATE, and we will ALL work around it for them. FIL seriously just texts back “we want to be there but I know it’s hard to pick a date that works for everyone”.... WHY?! Why will they not just tell us a day?!?! My husband responded with “are you telling US to just pick a day and you’ll try to be there if you can?” And FIL said “we want to be there, but the holiday is hard.” 

Okay... so we ask about a day a couple weekends later. Again, days of no responses on that one too. At this point, I want to start sending invites out to other people so others can make sure they can get the day off too, so hubby and I commit to the other date we picked out without MILs blessing, because fuck it at this point, ya know. 

Well guess what, one day later after straight up just telling MIL the party will be on X day, and they can either show up or not... she texts me and says “got the day off, the party is a go!!!!!”

Like are you kidding me lmao. The party was a go with or without you, ya weirdo. Shoulda just done that from the get-go. They drive me insane y’all",JUSTNOMIL

""I missed my baaaabbby boy!!! I miss you SO MUCH!! Why don't you come visit us????""
We've had this talk. He tried his best.
""We come over sometimes mom, we text first for the ok. You can text us and see if you want to come over! The house is clean enough for your LO.""

"Little background: Me, DH, &amp; kiddo. Kiddo is disabled (non verbal and developmentally delayed). DH &amp; I have been together for 10 years and she's always disliked me for stealing her baaaaaby.

Anyways. 

Our kiddo turns 4 on Thursday, and we're having a party for him on Saturday afternoon. Invites went out, everyones looking forward to it, my parents and siblings love kiddo so much and wouldn't miss it for the world. FIL and Step-MIL are in the same mindset. 

MIL, Step-FIL, and BIL have completely different mindsets. BIL is a flying monkey, and old enough to know better. 

When we invited MIL and Step-FIL to kiddo's party, you could see the cogs turning in her head, searching for excuses, and she chose ""we smelled gas a couple of weeks ago and a gas man is coming out on that same Saturday! Isn't that just typical?"" ... Yes, MIL, very convenient. And clearly a huge lie. 

BIL is refusing to come on the terms of ""not knowing anyone who is going"", oh, so not his own brother then?

I don't know why we keep inviting them to these events. I want to stop trying with these people, but DH keeps trying to hold on for maybe a small scrap of love that she might toss his way one day.

Little extra: DH and I finally got married last October. She wasn't excited at all. Didn't want it to happen. Few days ago her best friend got married. You can bet big money that she posted all about that on Facebook and talked excitedly about that to everyone. We've seen her friends out and about, who didn't know we were even engaged, let alone married. If you saw the look on DH's face you would have cried, too.",JUSTNOMIL
" UPDATE AT BOTTOM OF POST

I was out of town with my sisters for my birthday so DH had some friends and their kids over as well as MIL. MIL had a bumble date over because she would rather meet him with people around. 

Chances are the guy is fine and normal but I can’t help but feel like MIL crossed a boundary. This isn’t her house. I don’t want to make a big deal out of it but I need some perspective here.

UPDATE: forgot to mention, MIL lives an hour from us so she couldn’t meet this guy at her house BUT this isn’t the first time she came to “spend time with us” and then used it as an opportunity to meet some dude from a dating app.  Anyways...I talked to DH and got some more info. Everyone was outside the whole time so I’m relieved about that.  We are surrounded by cafes and restaurants but MIL still felt this would be meeting the guy “alone” so she was going to meet him outside our front gate. DH felt awkward and put on the spot so told her he could come into the yard. Apparently he was only over for 15 minutes. I still don’t know what to think about this particular instance but we decided that if something like this happens again DH will shut it down.",JUSTNOMIL
"Male(me):26
Female:24
Dating for: 6 months

Were both high income working citizens in the tech field, and are entirely independent from our parents.

My boyfriend and I are extremely serious and have decided to move in with each-other, as a stepping stone to marriage. 

My parents try to be extremely controlling and have a terribly long history of abuse both physical and emotional towards me. Ive always  had a horrible, toxic relationship with my parents and we are not very close, and do not talk often. Over the past few years, ive taken all financial control away from them and have detached from them as much as possible, I moved out, live a distance away in NYC, and have moved off of their phone plane and taken away their access to my financials.

Recently, i reached out to them to tell them the good news about meeting my loving and awesome bf and our decision to move in with each other. However upon hearing the news, they’ve turned vile.

After hearing this news about a month ago, my parents have:

1. Screamed extremely disgusting profanities, slut shamed me, called me “bit**” multiple times. Have claimed it’s all just for sex.

2. Made threats about showing up at our work places to catch us and make a scene.

3. Made threats about finding my bf’s parents address, calling them, showing up at their location, to abuse them and force them to convince him to end the relationship.

2. Make up stories claiming that I’m “in trouble, am going to Hell” for not asking for permission first.

4. Claimed that they have the ultimate last say, and if they don’t approve of me they will force me to live at home. They’ve said that if i dont listen they will burn my life to the ground and turn everyone against me.

5. Demanded my bf to come beg at their feet for permission. 

6. Blamed everything on my bf’s parents who have been nothing but supportive and happy for the both of us. Called his parents disgusting profanities.




TL;DR-my bf and I made the decision to move in together. We are both set on marriage, just not yet. Bf’s parents approve, my parents are threatening to destroy our relationship by: 
1. Showing up at our workplaces to make a scene
3. Defaming me in public settings 
2. Calling my bf’s parents/showing up at his parents house and stalking them/trying to convince them to get us to breakup",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi everyone! Sorry for any errors, I just found this sub through r/entitledparents, and was told I’d probably have a mom that fits here. 

I’m sure you can look at my post history to see what I’ve put over there, but I wanted to share one of the really infuriating/funny things my JNM tried to pull.

Setup: GF and me [22 F] have been dating for five years now, and moved in together over a year ago after I graduated college. JNM has been getting slowly more and more crazy since then (she never truly approved of my relationship) , until she suddenly snapped around April. A whole ordeal where she was insulting and degrading GF, expecting me to just accept it, as she’s treated me the same way in the past. 

I didn’t, and after realizing talking with her was pointless, blocked her number and gave up. 

A week or so later, GF and I start getting weird replies to our tweets. Sure enough, it’s clearly JNM. GF is more vocal than I am, and made a few tweets  on her personal twitter to the effect of “Be nicer to your daughter, JNMIL!” We then both blocked her, and the next evening I got this entertaining email.

Basically, she had a giant hissy fit (more since then, too - she keeps using new emails to message me). What really made me angry was she insulted GF yet again: this time going after her childhood. GF was raised mostly in foster care.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hello all! I've posted before about my MIL. I wouldn't say she's entirely JustNo but she definitely has her days. (If you read my previous post, baby shower ended up not happening so immediate drama was avoided). Anyway, onto my current issue with her. 

Recently MIL visited us. She's supposedly severely allergic to cats (I have two) so she stayed AirBnB thankfully. When she first came over she had a book with her, and said ""oops, didn't mean to bring this with me!"" Weird but whatever, I didn't think anything of it. She hangs for a bit, we go out to eat, come back and chill some more. After she leaves, DH tells me she left her book on our table. I go peak and this thing is titled ""The Vaccine-Friendly Plan"" or some shit like that. Now, my MIL is a bit of a woo-woo girl. Essential oils, organic only everything, the government is poisoning us with chemtrails, etc. I don't begrudge her her concerns, but I don't view things the way she does it seems. This vaccine thing is unfortunately one of those. On the plus side I know she's not necessarily anti-vaxx because she vaccinated both her kids on a delayed schedule. So out of curiosity about what she's teaching herself I flipped the intro open.

This fucking author claims he's seen CLEAR, irrefutable evidence PERSONALLY, that proves an increased use of vaccines in children causes such maladies as peanut allergies, ADHD, and of course autism. This is the shit she's putting in her head. Now normally I would laugh to my DH about it and move on, but it has really been bothering me. She left in on the table in our house the entire weekend, each time saying ""oh I need to remember that later."" At one point I even told her not to forget it and put it next to her purse. She still left without it until the last day. Maybe I'm crazy but it felt like she was leaving it on purpose for us or something.

 I'm having a baby soon and my doctor asked if my DH had his tDAP. I didn't know, he couldnt remember, so I had hoped MIL would know.  I texted her about it after she left and she said she ""still has his immunization records!"" I told her if she could find out for me asap I'd really appreciate it. That was a week ago. She's talked to DH a few times since then and hasn't brought it up, and hasn't texted me back about it. At this point I'm getting concerned that he hasn't been vaccinated and she's just not going to say anything.



So lovelies, any recommendations on how to bring this up? I don't want to make her feel too judged or like I think she's an idiot for reading that stuff (even if I do). At the same time I don't want my MIL to lie to me when it could possibly lead to my baby dying of Whooping Cough.


*Edit: I glanced at bookface and she just so happened to post about vaccines just a bit ago. Apparently she doesn't like ""snark"" from people that ""mock parents concerned about vaccines."" I won't say anything to her publicly but any doubt I had about talking to her about this is out the fuckin window. Getting DH the booster and a titer test asap. Thanks for the advice everyone. I have a feeling I'll be back to grump about this.",JUSTNOMIL
"Last week it was MILs birthday. SIL asked me what we were planning after MIL told her to plan something. I have no problem helping even if I wasn’t ‘asked’ and volunteered *eyeroll*.

It ended up being a great party.. off to a rocky start because SIL didn’t tell MIL anything and she thought everyone forgot about her birthday. She stared inviting people over for dinner the day of at her place because she assumed we didn’t plan anything.

Everyone was at me and DH house waiting for her. She was pissed off upon arrival because she was expecting company. Everyone she invited over was already at our house. Que everyone teasing of her because she was mad. Que SIL bitching about MIL throwing a fit. 

DH literally told me that was going to happen. ‘I told you she was gonna be maaaad’ hahaha I didn’t know SIL was making it a surprise. 

I got her a great gift. She was very happy. Kinda said thank you and by that I mean told DH to tell me she said thank you. I’ll take it lmao.

The next day she expected us over for Sunday dinner AGAIN not even after spending all day Saturday with us. Me and kids didn’t go. Have fun hubby lol. I’m only going to see her once a week from now on. That’s a lot right? I have other people I want to see too. I spent the day with my dads family, I missed them.

"My now-husband and I have been together 7 years, so I had an idea of his mother’s antics, but I had no idea what she would pull for our destination wedding. The wedding was just yesterday, so this is all very fresh in my mind. Maybe I’ll calm down a bit with time. 

We flew to our destination city with my now in-laws, but had told them in advance we have a ton to do to prepare once we arrive. We had favors to pick up, errands to run, etc. We dropped them off at their rental shortly after we landed and told them we had to pick up a few things before the stores closed. We had briefed them on the city (it’s extremely walkable and there’s a ton to do). Before we even arrived at the first store, my husband received a call from his mother, cursing us out and screaming that they have nothing to eat and that we abandoned them, complete with many choice words I’m choosing to leave out here. He calmly tried to help them find a restaurant, only to be hung up on. Every time he tried to call her back, she answered and hung up immediately.  They wanted nothing to do with the wedding planning and didn’t offer to help, but threw a temper tantrum when we couldn’t cater to their needs. Throughout the next two days, we had many guests arrive, and invited his parents to participate in various events with my family and our friends. They refused to participate and again got angry that we weren’t spending time with them. We live in the same city, we can see each other any time.

On the day of the wedding, she talked during, and sobbed loudly and dramatically during the ceremony, drawing all attention to her. She complained loudly during the mother/son dance that she doesn’t know how to dance (even though my husband offered to teach her multiple times before the wedding), and made awkward and uncomfortable comments throughout the reception. She complained to the DJ about the heat. I knew she was a bit socially unaware going into this- you cannot carry on a conversation with her because she does not listen. She just waits for her turn to talk, or cuts you off in the middle of a sentence, to talk at you about whatever it is she wants to talk about. However, I never imagined it would be this bad and I feel she has ruined my wedding. 

I had planned on taking my husband’s last name since I am not particularly invested in my own, and I like the idea of us sharing a name, but I now feel physically sick about sharing a last name with his parents. Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice?",JUSTNOMIL
"I was just reading a post about a JNM trying to put a baby in the pool against mom's wishes. It made me think about my own MIL whos obsessed with this creek that runs in her property. My family and I went for a visit and literally the first thing I said when it was suggested we go there is that DD is to go nowhere near that creek. All agreed. She can't swim. She's 20 months old. We went in April so the snow run off from the mountain makes that creek a raging river. 

We get there and we all went on a walk, to guess where!? The creek! I said, ""when we get to the tree line I'm picking her up"". 
MIL- she'll be fine! Let her go!
ME- no. All it takes is one slip, this creek is a river right now, I'm picking her up. 

She didn't talk to me for the rest of the day, actually hid in her room. Seriously? You're going to be sour? That's fine. I was surprised at how much her attitude about the whole thing didn't bother me. We have a terrible history. Trying to take my actively nursing baby out of my arms, trying to give 7 month old pure SYRUP, telling me I stole her son away, telling me she's the reason I didn't get an abortion (she convinced my husband to keep the baby...like I don't make that decision...like she played God with my child's life) and having no boundaries in general.  I should add she has since apologized for all that(she didn't mean any of that! She was drunk!) Drunk lips..well, they tell the truth. 

Ok this turned into more than just the creek incident, but seriously why do grandparents wanna put a kid who can't swim in or around water!? What's the obsession!?",JUSTNOMIL
"Flair says ""No advice wanted"" but advice is always welcome and appreciated for future interactions with TSM.

&amp;#x200B;

I had previously posted about my Bridal Shower and TSM being her usual self.  I can only make a quick update for the wedding and not an actual post. She made one snide comment about seating, but FIL put her in her place and shut it down quick.  DH and I didn't get word of the comment until over a week later, and FIL assured us everyone loved the ceremony and reception and no one complained about anything but her, and that he was being extra vigilant to shut anything down from her.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I thought I'd do a post detailing the first offense(s) that made me see that DH wasn't over exaggerating TSM and her behavior towards him. I was in the FOG after meeting her in public restaurants, she seemed great (although a heavy drinker and smoker). I got my wake up call the day before and during my birthday dinner.

&amp;#x200B;

We had gone over to the IL's house to either drop something off or pick something up (this was 7 years ago, so I'm a little fuzzy on why we had to go over).  I had recently moved across the country to be with DH, and this was the first time spending one-on-one time with TSM, while DH played video games with his younger sister (SIL). TSM opened a bottle wine and we stood in the kitchen, drinking and having a great conversation ... until ... SIL comes in and asks why we didn't go with them to the beach the day before.  I didn't even know they were going to the beach, and we had stayed in doing nothing but watching movies, and we would have definitely loved to have gone!

&amp;#x200B;

Me : ""We never got an invite for the beach.""

SIL : ""Mom was suppose to text DH!""

TSM : ""I did text him.""

Me : ""We were together all day yesterday, he never got a text message from you.""

TSM : ""He did, he is just hiding it from you.""

Me : ""We have each other's passwords, and he tells me who he gets a phone call or text from, as I do with him.""

TSM : ""NO! He's *hiding* things from you.  Just like his father *hides everything* from me.  You need to snoop through his phone and email when he's in the shower to find out the truth.""

\--At this time TSM and FIL had just started having marital problems and she was about to kick FIL out of their house.  That's a whole different story for here.--

&amp;#x200B;

I was absolutely shocked that anyone would ever tell someone to snoop on their SO. I knew DH never got an invite to TSM's family outings (and we still don't, even though they are SOOOOO adamant about how we're  *faaaaamily).*  I finished my glass of wine and went to get DH to tell him we needed to go.  We informed her that we would be unavailable the next day as we were doing my birthday dinner with friends, and we'd see her on Thanksgiving for ... well, Thanksgiving and the family birthday celebration.  TSM asked DH what his work schedule was, she needed us to take SIL to her dance class because they were short staffed at work and her schedule changed.  DH said he was in between projects and had no set schedule until New Years Eve (he worked in the bar and service industry helping to open bars/restaurants and was only bartending on an on-call status until the company he was contracted with was ready to open another bar).  TSM said okay, told us when SIL needed the ride, we would make sure she got there no problem, and we left.

&amp;#x200B;

I told DH what she said about how I should look through his phone and email because you were hiding family get together invites from me, and I assured him I didn't believe her for one second and would NEVER betray his trust. I had been yanked slightly from the FOG, as I hoped it was just a one time thing, and maybe the fact that she was getting drunk and defensive. *Maybe she was embarrassed she had forgotten, some people get very defensive when they're embarrassed.* Nope. That's just her.

&amp;#x200B;

Next night we are at a restaurant with some friends, celebrating my birthday.  TSM calls, I answer (if it's my family or DH's family I'll always answer, never know if it's an emergency, as we are the first called when it is).  She doesn't have a greeting, no hello, no nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

TSM : ""How is DH paying for rent if he's unemployed?!?!?!""

WTF ... how is that an appropriate thing to ask someone, celebrating their birthday, that you barely know. I was silent, I was too shocked to answer right away.

TSM : ""Is DH's grandparents paying for his lifestyle?!? Are *YOU* paying for him?!?!""

I finally was able to speak, but because of the shock of these questions, when she knew we were out to dinner to celebrate a birthday I actually answered her, which DH didn't like but understood that I was too shocked to shut her down, and too new in a relationship with her.

Me : ""We split all the bills, and he isn't unemployed.  He's picking up shifts at another bar and has his VA benefits. DH's grandparents don't pay for anything for us.""

TSM : (I could hear the CBF in her voice) ""*FINE.* But if they give him ANY money I NEED to know.  I *NEED* to get just as much for SIL.  Actually I *DESERVE* more than they give DH."" And she hung up on me.

&amp;#x200B;

I turned to DH and quietly told him what just happened. He was livid.  His grandparents paid every single cent for SIL's multiple dance classes (two different studios), all her costumes, all hotel/gas/food expenses for BOTH parents when she traveled around the state for competitions. TSM received more than her fair share from her IL's while DH and I were almost completely independent from them financially (we would, and still do, help with computer/phone/technology issues or move things that are too bulky or heavy for them, and we would be compensated for our time. This was never more than once a month, or once every two months).

&amp;#x200B;

I was yanked right out of the FOG. After dinner I apologized that I didn't fully believe him, and that I wouldn't tell her another thing about our private life without first consulting with him.  I told him I'd make sure I'd put all calls on speaker, and show him all text messages so she couldn't gaslight us. He agreed to do the same.  We have maintained this, and we never go off alone with her for private talks (except for the drunken graduation incident, but that just re-affirmed we can't trust her).

"Occasionally DH and I will talk about a past experience so he can process and take a further step out of the FOG. Last nights convo was about him realising yet another one of my ‘observations’ was spot on. 


Queenie has a step daughter and 2 daughters in law, well, one now we’re NC. 

I’d noticed that whenever we went up to his mums, it would be the stepdaughter or DIL doing her housework, cooking, ironing etc
I had asked the other DIL if she wanted me to cook for everyone (8 adults, 4 kids) as she had just finished her own work, picked up her (2) kids and came straight to Queenie’s and started cleaning, and Queenie went “Oh, yes! We can finally see if you can cook!”. I shrugged it off, made dinner, cleaning and washing as I went, so there’d be nothing to clean up apart from plates and cutlery after dinner. 


All the time Queenie is lounging on her sofa, feeding the kids endless sweets, shouting instead of talking, and generally ordering people about. I clear the table, do the washing up and the kitchen is SPOTLESS, Queenie heaves herself out of her seat and goes “OH! It’s so clean! DIL2 you never clean it like this! SD make me a cuppa! DIL2, did you bring the washing in?” and for me, it clicked. 


Queenie doesn’t do ANYTHING. 
She works from 6am-2pm, comes home, sits on her arse and orders her stay at home son, daughter in law and step daughter to do everything for her. 
She doesn’t cook, she doesn’t clean, she doesn’t do laundry, nothing. I went up one weekend (before we were NC) and she had her stepdaughter wallpapering, painting and glossing her hallway! SD has 2 young kids, but it was okay because ‘granny will look after them!’ Which meant ‘let them run around, eat far too much junk food and let them away with murder.’

It struck me that one of the reasons she doesn’t like me, apart from taking her precious first born away and being a psych, I can see through her shit, is because I don’t run around after her. If I’m making tea, I’ll ask if anyone else wants a cup. If I see someone struggling, I’ll offer to help, but I’m not doing your housework, cooking, cleaning and decorating for you. 

I run around after DH, happily. I’m not running after Queenie as well.",JUSTNOMIL
"MIL seems to have this habit where she will stare at me for long periods of time and it makes me so uncomfortable. I could be across the room from her and I can see her staring at me. Yesterday during a family party she had asked me a question and after I had answered she continued staring so I stared back thinking she eventually would look away but nope it turned into a full on stare down (I gave up after several minutes)!  I asked my fiance and he said she does it to everyone, but it really creeps me out. I have to see her often and she comes over to our house quite a bit. I can't stand her being in our house anymore because she makes me so uncomfortable! How do you deal with someone like this?",JUSTNOMIL
"Hey, I'm hoping someone can relate to this/help me figure out why Im feeling the way I do.

Basically - when there's good news in your own JustNo universe, how do you react? We just heard some good news regarding a DH family member (wedding announcement!), and yet i felt anxiety and dread and I feel terrible for immediately feeling that way! I also hate the narc-y implication of feeling weird over someone else's happiness. I hope it doesnt mean Im a narc because I recognize the feeling and totally want to deal with it asap!

I have a few theories. One is that as I dropped the rope and went VLC recently, im torn between reaching out to send well wishes, or just leaving it to DH. Im also reminding myself that when my own mostlyYes family have news, I deal with them and it's not really a big deal whether DH bothers to send a text, or sign a card or whatever. Everyone knows that my messages are from both of us. Regardless, I was raised a certain way and feel like it's bad of me to not send my own message of goodwill. I think the obvious thing is I'll just ensure DH sends a card from both of us. im just hyper aware that my lack of response on family social media announcement might seem kinda rude... but also, screw social media! 

Another theory is down to how my ILs treat everything like a contest. For example, I know for a fact that my baby-rabies-riddled MIL is keeping tabs on how various family members are ALLLLLLLLLL having baaaaaabies, especially the ones who got married after or around the same time as DH and I. She makes no connection to the fact that we married at a relatively younger age than some of these people (many of whom are significantly older than us), and hey, who said you need to be married to have babies anyway. I know this cos she  told my mom about alllllll the people ""beating us"" in the preggo stakes. So my lack of response will be noted, and this event (a wedding) will be compared and contrasted to every other wedding, including ours. This is how they operate, and no doubt our transgressions - such as how MIL didnt feel included, and how it wasnt in her church, and I never changed my name, and didnt pop out a grandbaby 9 months later, yadda yadda yadda - will be highlighted as ""what not to do"". 

Another theory is that Im mourning the relationship I never truly had with these people. DH is the scapegoat and by extension im the SG-DIL, so it's liberating to realize I likely never stood a chance, and it's good we've never given into baby rabies pressure, or wedding-related whining. 

A part of me is like ""am I jealous? Do I want to have my wedding day all over again? am I turning into a JustNo""?, but I had my own fantastic wedding and was always glad to never have to plan one again, and I enjoy actually being married (milestone anniversary coming up soon!) vs all the cray of wedding planning. I also hate being the center of attention, so am totally glad to never deal with wedding again. I've also attended and been in tons of weddings since my own, and have loved every second of them all (my friends and family), so the notable factor is the fact it's an IL-centric event that's bumming me out. I also remember that my family is just so welcoming to DH and we jsut dont do that dumbass ""earning your place at the table"" BS. People just take others as they find them in my family, and if anyone was a jerk to him, they'd hear all about it from me! 

Maybe Im just sad that DH and I could have been spinier back then? And that we dealt wth more nonsense from MIL than these non-scapegoats will likely have to deal with? Maybe that's something I resent? Another part of me thinks that my previous boundary setting and public shaming of MIL excluding me might prevent her being a total bitch to others and that DH and I have done these people a favor, but get no respect or thanks for it. Instead Im seen as ""difficult"" at worst or an entertaining loose cannon at best.  

is this any way normal to just hear ""IL event that you HAVE to attend"", and just feel bleh about it? Please tell me if Im being JustNo!",JUSTNOMIL

"It’s the end of my daughters first birthday weekend and before I begin, it was fabulous. My girl had such a beautiful time and we are so grateful for everyone who turned out. But I wouldn’t be here if it was entirely uneventful!

I am still aggravated with DH’s mother. She’s never been grandmother (or mother) of the year, so we aren’t surprised. But it’s maddening being stood up for the millionth time. I sent out invitations about 2 and a half weeks before the party. We were closing on the lake house we were hosting it out and I sent them the same day just to be sure we had the place. 

I sent her a text when I sent out the cards just to give her a heads up. To recap, that is nearly 3 weeks notice. Here was her response:

“Hi! Unfortunately, I have plans made for that weekend that can’t be broken. Maybe if I’d known sooner I could be be there.”

Like... what plans could you possibly have that are unbreakable for you granddaughter’s (only grandchild) FIRST BIRTHDAY PARTY? Anyone who would begrudge you breaking plans with them are psychopaths. But also, she’s known to want to use pet names when she does talk to us but she has only ever actually met our daughter twice. In a year. When she lives 45 minutes away. 

Also, somehow it’s my fault for not giving her more than...3 weeks notice? Okay MIL. It’s not as if we were hoping she would make it, she has a tendency to sit my herself and CBF at everything going on around her or literally crying and making a spectacle of herself (this is what she did at our wedding).",JUSTNOMIL
"Hellooo, I’ve been lurking a while now, first time posting in this sub, also on mobile, please let me know if I break rules/do anything wrong.

Also I have seen that nicknames are given to the terrible MILs or moms. I have the perfect one. I have chosen to nickname her Eternal Victim(EV), since it is her prime motive to spin any situation for her to be the victim in it.

So this happened at some point last summer. Let me preface this by saying my mother (EV) just LOVED to do my daughters hair. I kept asking her not to because it looked awful and she always knotted it up terribly in the elastic, but she kept doing it, and she would actually take out any hairstyle I had put in to do her own. 
So one day my kiddos were playing outside, and EV was sitting on the porch, I was cleaning and also keeping an eye on things from inside the house, there is a window that overlooks the porch but you wouldn’t really be able to see someone watching you unless you turned around and looked up at the window. I also had it open for fresh air.
So I’m inside when I hear EV call over my older daughter and pulls a hair brush and elastic out of her purse. Daughter runs over to see what she wants, EV says come and sit down so I can do your hair, daughter says it’s already tied up and she doesn’t want to, EV keeps going and says oh please it will only take a minute and it will make me so happy, daughter says don’t you remember? Mommy said no last time! And she’s in charge! Then ran off to play. EV sat stunned.
Omg I have never been so proud of that girl. She is normally very sweet, easy going and a fantastic listener but she is also very able to read situations and knows when something is wrong and is definitely a mama’s girl. 
EV sat in the corner and sulked, crossed arms. And I watched in the window with a smirk.


Edit: Holy smokes! Thank you for all the support!!!!! I have seriously never felt so validated. I went NC with EV less then a year ago and came out of the fog, she did some absolutely heartbreaking things that I am still trying to recover and this has really helped thank you so much, it makes me want to tell stories of more of the stupid crap she would pull lol but the endings aren’t always as happy as this one.",JUSTNOMIL
"FTP, LTL, alternate account. 

Although not an outright JNMIL, she's on the track. Maybe she's too passive to be full-blown, but I am still struggling with what has been happening over the last couple years. Quick background? You got it.

Met DH 10 years ago, moved in together right away, fell in love, dated for awhile. Been married for 5. One kid and one on the way. Moved to his city which is full of his whole family, including the in-laws. His parents are older than mine by about 20 years, so generation-wise, quite an adjustment. His mother is also a garage sale/junk collector/family inheritor/hoarder. Not extreme hoarder. But hoarder. Can't let things go. Has about 5 bookshelves worth of cookbooks that haven't been opened since I came into the picture. Continually reminds us that her mother lived in her own house until she passed away (important to this story).

The current saga:

For as long as I've known DH his father (a very much JYFIL) has had serious chronic health issues. We moved our wedding up by a couple years because he was in a bad way and didn't know if he would make it. Thankfully he did make it, beat a couple kinds of cancer (yay stem cells!), but still struggles daily. Constant pain, low energy, lack of motivation. 

They live in an older, giant house. Two floors, a basement, lots of bedrooms. There are only the two of them in the house. Every single room is full of junk. You would think a family of 5 lived there. Bulletin boards in my DH's old room are still full of stuff from high school, which he graduated from well over 20 years ago. You get the picture. 

Neither JNMIL or JYFIL were ever in great shape, they aren't obese but they lead a pretty sedentary lifestyle. This coupled with health issues, my JYFIL is unable to maintain the house the way that we would like. My DH goes over to do their lawn, take out their garbage, remove the snow, they also have a housekeeper, etc (meanwhile we both work full-time, have a house, a young kid, and another on the way). I know this pains him, as he is the type of man who takes pride in keeping busy and tinkering around the house. But with his health he just can't keep up. If he had his way, he would have moved into a small house on a lake 15 years ago. At this point, he would be happy to move into a small condo. 

This is where the JNMIL comes in. She refuses to move. Every single time it is brought up in conversation, there are excuses. First she likes the location of their house and won't move (meanwhile there are multiple apartment/condos within a 2 mile radius), next she said that if she got groceries she would have to unload her car, wait for an elevator, walk to the condo, and it would just be too much (meanwhile they're both retired and aren't in any rush, plus have grown-up kids that could easily help out once a week to help bring up groceries), next it's that her neighbor across the street is in her 80s and hasn't moved (weak excuse), next she says what if I don't like the neighbors? (don't talk to them). Her mother lived in her house until she passed away, so that's what she plans on doing (eyeroll). All of her excuses could actually take up an entire post. And this one is getting long enough already. My DH has already said that I need to stay out of it, since they're his parents, and he is trying really hard (along with his siblings) to convince them they need to move (spoiler, it hasn't been working).

So last week my JYFIL fell in their garage. He didn't have his phone on him, so it took awhile before anyone knew he was there. She had to call the neighbor to come and help get him up. Luckily nothing was broken and everything is fine, he is though in rough shape and is sore. Since he can't walk up their stairs to go to bed, he's been sleeping on the couch on the main-floor. 

Yesterday she came over to play with our offspring for a bit in the afternoon (usually we go to their place, since they don't get out much). She starts complaining about how bad JYFIL is doing right now. How he can't go up the stairs, how he is in so much pain, how she's had to sleep on the recliner beside him to make sure he's okay at night. Then she hits us with this great line:

""I just wish I knew what I could do to help him.""

I had to leave the room. I am a very opinionated person and if I had stayed I would have lost it on her. She is completely selfish and can't seem to understand that they have to get out of that house for the sake of his health (and frankly, hers too). It makes me so angry that she can't see that her husband's quality of life is so low because she refuses to move. Her stuff and her house are more important than improving their health. 

Am I overreacting? Advice? Thoughts? Cookbook swap?",JUSTNOMIL
"I've posted about my mother (and my MIL) before, but DH reads my primary account, and I'd just like advice, (partly on how to support him), so I'm here with a new/temp account for advice.

**Here's the setting:** DH and I are a young couple. We're both uni grads, but I just immigrated (literally landing in a week!) and haven't been able to work in DH's country. I consulted online, DH worked full time, we lived in DH's parent's basement rental suite, and we survived. Our forever 'easy' lives together begin in a week, and we are so excited. DH has an inheritance,   that was invested in the house (owned by DH's parents that we were living in). Their house just sold, and we're finding a new home, but staying in a spare-room in the week we are without a lease or house. Essentially, we are moving, and MIL is involved in it, it's not ideal, but it will be over in 2 weeks tops, and we will be +7 hours away, and living happy.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's the situation:** I played flute all through secondary school, (competition-solo-level played flute, and still play/have my intermediate level instruments). When I moved to DH's country, I couldn't take much, just what would fit in my car. I have few, treasured items. I took my clothes over a few trips, and have a suitcase of momentos. I insisted on taking barstools that mean a lot (my first new piece of furniture). My flute remains held hostage at my parent's home. But I managed to bring my piccolo with me.

But anyways, we're moving into DH's parent's spare bedroom for a week, and my vintage, hand carved/craftsman made concert piccolo was in a box, along with stuff like DH's and I's diplomas, wedding momentos, ect. Important stuff. And as musicians know, wood-woodwind instruments don't need temperature or climate variation. Surefire way to fuck your $500+ instrument up. It's the one rule. I packed the piccolo, and put it in when FIL was making a trip. Taped a note saying ""plz put me in OP &amp; DH's temporary bedroom!"", told FIL, and texted MIL a specific request. In the same texting ""conversation"" she asked about her piano that was at the house, saying that it was one of the only pieces of furniture left from her parents, she would sob if anything happened to it, ect. (the woman LIVES at her childhood home, and doesn't play this piano that you could get 12 of for free on your preferred online marketplace).

So the box was taken, and the next day, DH and I showed up to the house (to organize our temporary bedroom), and my Special Request box is in the garage, with the garage sale shit. I'm livid, but piccolo is fine. DH later mentioned my annoyance to MIL &amp; FIL (I didn't even say anything) and at first MIL denied, but I had a text confirming she KNEW, and then she and FIL decided to get angry and say it was my fault for not being there to receive it myself. Angry. At my ANNOYANCE. Later, after unloading a trailer of furniture, she erupts at DH and I in front of DH's uncle. ""FIL WAS RIGHT. YOU'RE BOTH UNGRATEFUL ASSHOLES!!!""

I don't have a car anymore....I use DH's but DH was at work, and it was ONE request, and I am not a demanding person. But MIL called me an asshole to my face, and also went on a joint rampage with FIL .... insulting me in front of DH while I wasn't in the room....and... several other things. There hasn't been an apology, only excuses. Someone was mad that MIL gave away furniture, MIL has had a long week, SIL says we should just all be niceeee and get along. All the excuses have been given, but no, ""geez op, I'm sorry I called you mean things and forgot something important to you!""

DH and I are not people who raise our voices at people. Our parents all yell when angry, and we both just can't handle yelling. Our fights are the most quiet, even-toned discussions. I make people FEEL my disappointment/rage, with zero eye contact, and my disdain for their presence. So MIL has seen me angry, but not this psycho-stewing-chill. Stern IDGAF OP has been unleashed.

AND ITS NOT ABOUT THE PICCOLO. it's about the absolute zero respect that displays, (also DH and I both recognize the problematic triangulation of spouses she tried to pull (TWICE actually), she was also angry at DH for smoking, and pulled a ""OOOOOppppppp don't tell DH, but he's not allowed to smoke anymore"" which, I just turned around and ""yo DH ya momma said the craziest thing""). But yes. I am not respected, and I have lost all respect.

I've had to really bite my tongue. Dyingggg to respond to one of MIL's ""you won't have free childcare where you're moving/you can't do pot and be a non-abusive parent"" (we won't even have kids for another 5 years? and are casual/weekend/cleancut cannabis people?) remarks with ""well I couldn't trust you with a damn piccolo at 65, what makes you think I'll trust you with my INFANT at 70? Also DH is a damn adult, and as long as it's not an issue, he is free to do whatever he wants. And if it is an issue, his WIFE will interfere."" (it's not an issue, MIL is just embarrassed that the neighborsssss see this *100% legal where we live* thing happening on a patio)

I also bitched MIL out for calling up DH's sister (she's older and thinks she's DH's parent) for advice on ""DH, the troubled child"". Don't think they realize/care how infantilizing and rude that is to DH. In DH-emotional-scale after this whole affair, he was a 9/10 on the hurt/betrayal/'who tf insults someone's wife in front of them' scale. I would have cried, but I was livid, so no tears, only psychotic nail filing. OP has received no apology, and MIL is in Time-Out. OP is HERE and taking no shit.

**And there is plenty of shit for the taking.**

This morning, I go to get my morning coffee, (the only coffeemaker in the house rn is upstairs outside of our suite, in danger territory), and MIL attempted to ""GOOD MORNING!!!!"" bomb me. I acted in an emotionally neutral way, neither displaying positive or negative emotions. No eye contact, just ""good morning', and continued pouring my espresso shot. MIL then informed me I needed to have DH's and I's dishes packed TODAY. I asked what day the moving truck was coming because...... I have all the cabinets cleaned and wiped out, dishes on the counter, but we need forks and glasses in the next week? She wouldn't answer and my educated guess is Wednesday. Since I got no reply, I just took my coffee and returned downstairs to 'home'.

Soon after, DH is demanded to help load furniture. I overhear MIL mock me to DH ""sO WhAT tIMe is the tRUcK CoMiNG"". Apparently MIL told DH that I was being a dick to her. Lol just refusing to be abused and asking when the moving truck is going to be here in a calm and even tone is being a dick. MIL is finally GONE for the day, but before leaving, didn't forget to shout ""I LOVE YOU, LOVE YOUR PARENTS"" at DH. I swear, if I wasn't married to, and in love with her son, and didn't want get deported, I'd slap a hoe.

I've basically internally framed it as parenting a petulant child who won't apologize for something they did wrong. And basically the moment I get a ""sorry for calling you an asshole in front of friends and family and your husband, and using you as a punching bag/not respecting you as a person"" \*SNAP\* parent goes back from stern to absolutely fine. But that hasn't happened yet. And I need a external opinion(s) to tell me if I'm being an ungrateful asshole, or am okay. And how I can support DH besides ""let's gtfo and NC the bitch"", because that was my knee-jerk reaction, and that's not what he needs right now.

&amp;#x200B;

**UPDATE:** *my DH just got a text basically saying that I was a terrible influence on him, and basically ruining his life/inspiring a terrible attitude in him. Thinking back, she did tell me a tale the other day of a ""friend she had, who married a foreigner, and he didn't work for two years, and she DIVORCED HIS ASS!!!"" I told DH ""yo babe your mom thinks you should divorce me because I haven't been able to work in 8 months"" and he ""phhhh no she doesn't, she's just telling a story!"" phhh I think not now smh.*",JUSTNOMIL
"It's been more than a week since the whole debacle went down so I wanted to provide an update. After my MIL went apeshit on DH and myself over the phone, she reached out to DH the next day (I had blocked her) to apologize for her behavior toward *him*. She proceeded to tell him that she's ""merely a human that makes mistakes and that he should forgive her"" reminding him of their Christian faith and values as they relate to forgiveness. She also mentioned that he needed to come and still meet with his father 1 on 1 and to ""make sure that AJ4ever does **NOT** come."" I was sitting next to DH when MIL kept texting him. The phone kept buzzing and buzzing so finally, I relented and asked DH what the hell does she keep saying now? DH handed me the phone and I saw that she was talking about me. She kept telling her son that he should lie to me and not tell me things she tells him, blah blah. I scrolled up to read more of her messages, and basically found out that she had been texting DH stuff about me all along basically blaming me for the fact that their family never gets to see their own son. After seeing this, I told my husband that I was very uncomfortable with his family and I felt like they were trying to break up our marriage this whole time. 

&amp;#x200B;

DH decided that he would go see his parents one last time to talk to them and if things did not pan well, he would go NC. I wasn't thrilled with this idea of him seeing them but DH felt that it needed to be done. So he went to speak to his father first and of course, the conversation did NOT go well at ALL. FIL berated my husband, made fun of my religion and told husband that he didn't like my kind. FIL said stuff about my family and safe to say, the conversation got extremely heated. This lasted about an hour. MIL got involved, but it was too late. FIL tried to hit my husband and my husband reacted with a reflex as if he was going to hit, but he did not. FIL stormed off. DH told MIL that he was done with the both of them and left. He has blocked his parents since and we have not heard from them.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, he got the most randomest call from his Uncle (whom I have never even met) and whom DH has not talked to in SO MANY years. At least, since we have gotten married. Uncle was trying to convince my husband that he should talk to his father lest he die and my husband regret getting the chance to really know him as a person. DH said he already knows him and politely got off the call. Safe to say, it looks like word has spread in the family that we have cut contact so I am anticipating calls from other family members coming in as the days go on. DH looks sad, but at the same time I don't know what else to do. Any thoughts on how to handle the pressure post NC?",JUSTNOMIL
"So I'm on the silent treatment again.

Backstory:
MIL is a covert narc. She uses gifting as a weapon, which I didn't even realize someone could do until I met her. She does this weird thing where she uses gifts (usually to my daughter) as a means to get my husband &amp; I to talk to her. She'll send something then check in every day ""did you get it?"" (as an excuse to get us to talk to her) then after we get is she wants pictures and to talk about every item she sends. She wants to hear how much we liked every single thing and will ask if I forget to mention an item. She sends boxes full of random shit from thrift stores, etc. She has a shopping problem and FIL is a hoarder.

About a month ago she sent me a picture of a kid's jean jacket asking if we wanted it. I said 'no, thank you.' She said oh, well it was BIL's. (BIL killed himself two years ago next week.) She ended up sending it in a box with other clothes for my daughter. There was also a tie dye dress. We talked when we got the box and she said to make sure not to send the dress or the jean jacket to Goodwill after we were done with them. She wants me to send them back to her. In the past she's tried to dictate what I do with gifts as well and this pissed me off. I have told her more than once I didn't want any gifts that had rules. The tie dye dress, turns out, belonged to the daughter of my BIL, who MIL isn't allowed to see. SIL is NC with narc MIL so subsequently MIL isn't allowed to speak to her child, (MILs dead son's daughter), which of course drives MIL batshit crazy. So now I have this stupid dress with all this emotional baggage tied up in it.

I sent her the following message: ""Please do not send &lt;my daughter&gt; or I anything from &lt;BIL&gt; or &lt;his daughter&gt;. You may send &lt;my daughter&gt; gifts on her birthday and for the holidays, if you wish. Please do not send any gifts outside of those two occasions. Please do not send anything that you need back, that you want her to wear a certain way, or ANY other obligation. You can expect a thank you for anything you send and nothing more. This includes telling you when we receive it, demanding pictures, etc. If you choose not to send anything based on my wishes here that's fine, too. If you choose to ignore my wishes we will go to no gifts at all."" She said she understood. This was about 3 weeks ago and no messages from her. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't mind the silence. Life goes on.

About two weeks ago I sent an email to MIL, FIL, and DH to coordinate a trip. DH &amp; I are moving stuff cross country from our old house to our new house (although we are already living in the new house.) We decided that the best plan would be for FIL &amp; DH to drive the u-haul, me and the toddler to fly back, and have MIL join us all at the destination. Now we knew this wouldn't be their first choice. They would want to drive to our new place and have MIL stay with my daughter while me, hubs, and FIL flew to the old house. But I immediately put the kibash on that idea. I don't trust MIL for a second with my daughter for a variety of reasons.

There are lots of logistics to figure out. I fully expected MIL &amp; FIL to be quite excited about our invitation since they are forever badgering us to visit and see my daughter (although I expected them to attempt to negotiate terms) but I knew something was up when I didn't get a reply. I IMd FIL and asked if those dates worked for them. No reply. Next day, I messaged him again. He says 'those dates work. I'm busy and can't talk right now.' That night DH gets a phone call from FIL, who tears him a new one about my disrespectful behavior. Said I made MIL cry at dinner with my boundaries on not using gift giving as an abuse tactic and lots of other really negative triangulation bullshit against me. Mind you, I've always had a totally fine relationship with FIL so I am a little hurt by this. I know it's just MIL's way of trying to punish me for her perceived slight about the gift-giving. DH knows they're crazy and his coping mechanism is to ignore them. MIL has tried to reach out to him several times in manipulative ways but he sees through it and just doesn't engage.

DH &amp; I decided that the best option is to change courses and exclude them from the move. It's going to be seriously less stress for he &amp; I. We do expect quite a bit of blowback once he tells FIL that he's changed his mind and doesn't want his help after all.

So I've decided to take MILs silent treatment one step further and just continue it permanently and go completely NC. DH is very supportive of this, as I am supportive of his choice to maintain VLC with his parents. The tricky part is, DH is planning to try to soften the blow by inviting them out later this Fall. So I'm not sure how this is going to look with my decision to go NC. I don't want to see them. They will want to visit the new house, and my daughter. I'm not trying to make a big stink but I am trying to quietly remove myself from them on social media, etc. I'm sure this will be noticed prior to their visit. So I don't know what to do while they're here. Get a hotel for a few days (fairly sure my husband would put me in a nice B&amp;B and I can come home at night)? I am new to the area so I only have one local friend. Maybe during the day I could go sightseeing in a nearby town or something? Any other ideas for a smooth NC transition?",JUSTNOMIL
"In case you missed it, we were awarded a 3 year No Contact Order for DH, YS, DD, and myself!!!!  The lawyer fees are probably the best present we ever gave ourselves!!!!!  Of course since this is JNMIL, we all know there is no way this is over.

Yesterday, PH &amp; edad's ~~church~~ cult had their annual Memorial day picnic.  NBD, I don't go, I hope they have a good time and life goes on.  Not so much.  Poor Sister Penny Hostile has to tell her tale of woe.   Don't you know, her infidel daughter and son and law are finding new ways to torture and abuse her?  PH has been victimized by lies and a corrupt legal system that I have figured out how to manipulate for my own good.

The flying monkeys have zoomed in, thrown their poop, and are going to be very upset later this week, when it is returned to them in via certified mail that includes a letter from my attorney along with a copy of the NCO, bwahh hahaha.  See, part of that NCO, covers third parties trying to contact us about PH or edad.  Along with that is the original NCO for OS.  We have legally covered ourselves very nicely.  I am going to give some examples of the type of stuff they are saying, and sending and you guys can let me know if we are out of line with the letters


From the pastor's wife: ""You are going to regret hurting your parents like this, someday.  How are you going to explain to your kids how horrible you are when they find out?""

From the pastor: ""God knows what kind of hatred you have in your heart.  Your parents have said if you will apologize, they will forgive you for everything.""

From busybody1: ""Sister PH, is so kind and loving, all she wants is to love on your babies.  She deserves time with her only granddaughter.""

From busybody2: ""Your children are going to hate you like you hate PH.  The bible says you need to honor your parents.  You will reap what you sow.""

From busybody3: ""You are a horrible mother to OS.  You have thrown him away and refuse to let him see the sister he loves so much and now you are doing the same thing to Sister PH.""

All of these people are blocked from calling, so they all put it in writing.  All told there has been contact from 14 seperate individuals.  I wish I could respond back how I *really* want to, by airing their dirty laundry and telling them some hard facts, but I guess I will leave it up to the courts.

"tl:Dr at the bottom

My JNMom is Hydra, so named for her fascinating array of hats she wears to finely tune to get what she wants from people. In my last post, I described her the fall-out of her gross behavior around my kid while the 3 of us were on vacation. I’d had an epiphany about boundaries and decided to just drop the damn rope. I have worth just for existing. I do NOT have real worth in my role as Hydra’s support animal. So, I stopped responding to phone calls and texts. Eventually she tapered off. It’s been nice and quiet.

Last week, she texted if she could call and emphasized it wasn’t about money. Jesus, so that tells me that Hydra thinks I’m avoiding her because I’m afraid she’ll bring up borrowing money. Well, sure, I guess that’s part of it, but really it was because I stopped catering to her needs by responding to her calls and texts in general. This is a great example of a narc, when faced with changing behavior in their narc supply, goes ahead and makes up something that fits their narrative. “Gruntled does not wish to speak to me because she doesn’t want me to ask her for more money.”

Here’s the thing, though. I’ve told her already that I will cover her car insurance each month and nothing more. She’s already tried the emergency money request, and I refused. But in her mind…well, we already know in a narc’s mind, it’s a nasty, messy labyrinth of illogic and chaos where nothing ever really makes any kind of sense.

Today has been a quiet, easy weekend with my kid. Movie, lunch out, video games, some chores. I just don’t even think to call or text Hydra any more. And of course, buzz-buzz, my cell goes off. Hydra has sent a text. Yay. Ugh. I considered ignoring it because I JNEW if I responded, she’d take that as an opening to emotional dump on me. And I was right. She wished us a nice weekend. I said I hoped she was having a good day.

“Sort of. Can I call you?”

No. Just no. If I said she could, I knew she’d try for hours of conversation. I’ve gotten to be a pro at giving her 15-20 minutes of phone time and then cutting her off. (It amuses me every time because I say something like “Well, I need to go to bed” and she’ll quickly say “Oh, I KNOW! I NEED to go to bed too!” Uh-huh, Hydra. We all know you weren’t planning that and were instead trying to come up with more topics to monologue about.)

I texted back “I’m a bit busy doing things around the house right now.” Which I was. I cleaned out the freezer, froze some chicken cutlets and just finished taking a look at my umbrella on the deck and realizing that I’ll need a ladder to reach the damn top. She counters with as blatant a statement about me being her emotional support animal without actually saying those words:

“I just need to hear a voice today. :(”

Oh dear. She’s got her **Sad Sack** hat on today. So sad. Poor Hydra. She’s so sad and needs to hear a voice. I stopped responding at that point. She has friends. Call them or text. Go outside, speak to a neighbor. Turn on the TV and listen to a voice. Hell, there are probably voices on the TV! But I know why those voices won’t do. She can’t monopolize their time. She can’t get her narc supply by monologing at them. She can’t “hlep” them through things with her religious speech. 

For the last few weeks, about once a week, she’s tried to call me so she can talk to my kid. She needs to say goodnight to him, she needs to hear his voice. It makes her feel better when she can talk to him. No. Again, just no. My child will not be used. He is a not a replacement for me. She cannot use him to manipulate her way back in. Since I’ve jumped ship from her raft, I will not allow her to try to suck him in to replace me. Fucking cow will not use my child.

The raft that was our family has tipped, and she’s scrambling to suck me back in to right the raft, but the jokes on her. I’m righting my own raft after booting her off. She needs to swim and stop using me and my kid as her support animals. But she won’t. I expected something nutso to happen at some point. I’ve been practicing in the mirror for when she announces she’s getting evicted. (Or some other catastrophe, like her car breaking down and needing thousands of dollars to fix it.) I’m not bailing her out. She’s not living with me, even for a “few weeks” until she can find something else.

As I sat here, typing, a few texts have come in, probably from her. But I’m busy. Even if I’m sitting doing absolutely nothing, I’m still too busy.


Tld: Hydra is still trying to wrangle her way back in and is using the Sad Sack hat. It’s not working because I just don’t care much about her anymore. I'm not her crutch and neither is my kid. I'm making more progress on disentangling myself from her emotional mesh.",JUSTNOMIL
"So my (20M) mother knows I’m gay. She took it pretty rough and it’s been about a year and it’s quieted down now but definitely not perfect. She’s always been snoopy but recently I came home from school and when I was asleep she went through my bag and found a condom. There was a big explosion with her yelling at me basically because she doesn’t want me to be the stereotype or whatever of the gay man who fucks random anonymous dudes in back alleyways. She knows absolutely nothing about my actual dating life because I refuse to let her in on any of it. I use condoms when I am sexually active because it’s the responsible thing to do, but having my mother imply I’m a sexual deviant every time I leave the house is really starting to wear on me. Anybody else gay and have a homophobic helicopter mom?",JUSTNOMIL
"I’m sorry for how long this is for a first post. It’s been a rough day and I needed somewhere to unload about my MIL. 

My BFs mom has always been more than a little attached. One time we were house sitting for my aunt and he had forgotten his phone at the house while we went to dinner, so she drove by the see if my car was there when he didn’t answer her calls. If he’s sleeping (literally downstairs in her house), and doesn’t answer her messages, she comes down and right on in-even if I’m there.  To say that she believes that she should always have 100% access to him at all times is an understatement.

For context to today’s debacle, my BF is likely borderline and has some substance abuse problems, but I’m happy 99% of the time and he’s been working on his impulse control and addictions. We’re both in our mid-twenties and live in an expensive state so we’re both living with our parents.

Last October, he overdosed and spent a week in the hospital. I stayed with him. His mother was LIVID that I was put down as his primary contact and that the doctors in the ICU told her that she’s a stressor for him so that she needed to only come once a day. When the doctors were taking his medical history/ asking about his recreational habits, she didn’t know half of the  information and lied about his drug use so the doctors “wouldn’t judge him”. On day 3, I asked her to stay with him for two hours so I could go home, shower, and have just a little time to myself for the first time since he was admitted. 30 min after I left, I stepped out of the shower a text saying that she had just left and that I should probably come back. So back I went. Apparently she had spent the whole time she was there talking about herself and trying to arrange follow-up appoints for him. When he said that he needed to take things one step at at time and she was overwhelming him, her only response was “Well, what about what *I* need?”, at which point he told her to read the vibe of the room, she left, and I was back 10min later to a dejected partner. When he later asked her to not come to the hospital unless he asks her to, she responded by showing up unannounced with his dad (an entirely different mess) the next morning and announcing that she wanted to be in the room for all of his psychiatrist and social worker interviews that day. He told her no, his dad said to let her, he said no again. At which point his mother looked over his head as told me to tell her everything the doctors said. Which led into another discussion about how he needs to take her feelings into consideration. 

Having just gotten back together, things are a little precarious. We’re working on communication and honesty and he admitted that he had a relapse but was taking the steps towards cleaning up. I told him that I love and support him, but that I know my worth so I’ll help him but not enable him. We were supposed to spend time together this weekend but my schedule was packed and when we talked last night, he was disappointed but was speaking clearly and was really alert, so I wasn’t too concerned. Fast forward to this morning. I texted him good morning and let him know when I could come over. About 5 minutes later, I get a text from his mom that she saw that I messaged him. She then said that he doesn’t have his phone and that she “doesn’t feel” like explaining what’s happening and to not call or go to the house. She’ll “let him text when he’s able to.”

What the fuck.

He never doesn’t have his phone on him. In the last 2 years, I’ve only seen it more than two feet from his person maybe 5 times. The last time she had his phone, it was when he was critical and I hadn’t gotten to the ER yet, so I’m 95% sure that he’s having some kind of medical emergency. I asked her if he’s at least ok, and she left me on read. When he was in last October, I wasn’t allowed to see him until she let me back because I had been to the house the night before and they told the EMTs that we had a fight (really I had put him in a cold shower to sober him up and then crashed on the couch because his room was too warm). Despite him telling her this, she has always blamed me for his OD. I’m sure that whatever happened, short of an actual accident, she’s already justified her behavior as protective. Because of we’re not married and the hospital here having a 1-contact policy, I have no way of knowing what’s going on until she decides to tell me or he’s able to use his phone.

TL/DR: MIL blames me for BFs problems, told me that he’s having an emergency, refuses to give me more information or let me see him.",JUSTNOMIL
"I swear this woman does not know what angle to pursue in order to create dispute between me and my husband. She hates that she has lost control over him and blames me for it. Lately my husband has developed a shiny spine and maintains his boundary’s (not 100%, but close enough). She is on good behavior, but I’m pretty what she did was intentional to hurt us.

Don’t get me wrong, I am ok with keeping the pics as a memory, but why would you as a mom give an album from your home with pictures of your sons ex to your son and wife? What was wrong with keeping the pictures at your house? It seems a petty way of trying to hurt me/us. D(amn) husband just looked at the photos when we arrived home, asked if I would like to look at them and put them in the kitchen table. Would never consider this as intentional. Even praised mil for her good behavior. The good part is that the pictures don’t bother me, but I am wondering what is she capable of doing in the future if she is this petty?",JUSTNOMIL
"LTL, FTP and on mobile -- We are TTC but my SO is concerned about his mother wanting to have our future infant overnight. All of our fam is 2+ hours away. My parents are JY and his mom and her husband (not dad, or even step-dad) are okay. We are VLC because they dont express interest in our lives. My MIL is not a bad person, but she gets jealous very easily and doesnt really go out of her way to have a relationship. 

My question to you all is how do you handle infant over night stays with one set of grandparents and not the other?

We've discussed that my parents will probably have infant over night care early on (not too early, and JYM is totally leaving it up to me to when I am comfortable with it) because they want to give us what my grandparents gave them -- a chance to sleep, go on a date, and keep our marriage in tact while figure the whole parenting thing out too. 

My parents have no indoor pets, MIL has 5 dogs and a bird (LOUD), MIL is married to a man we dont know super well, my parents engage with us on a daily basis, MIL contact us quarterly-ish and usually SO initiates. 

We both had these feelings separate from one another that we found we had in common. It's not a problem, but we feel likes its gonna be. SO and I are both only kids. 

Any advice? Should we start setting ground rules early?",JUSTNOMIL
"I’ve posted about my MIL before. About a month ago, SO and I went no contact with her. The stipulation was that until we can meet with her to discuss things she has said to me (and my husband) with a third party (our pastor), we need to cut ties to keep from escalating things even farther. 

Our desire is to basically have a cordial acquaintance-like relationship with her so that SO can attend family functions and see his grandparents in that context. We have a wedding that she’ll be at and (thanks to you guys!) we asked to be seated separately to avoid drama. 

She had been shit talking me to SO whenever I wasn’t around. She made fun of me for getting a stress and stinky food induced migraine (and a whole slew of other shit) at Christmas and has been treating me like competition ever since my wedding shower in April 2017. 

I realize she is probably on the Narc spectrum and she’s covert. She is “so nice” to everyone and tries to earn guilt by giving excessive gifts. 

I need to patch things up enough to attend the grandparents’ 50th wedding anniversary in November. (Yes! I realize that we should probably stay no contact.) We have a list of 5 or 6 boundaries that we want to start setting up with her once we get her to sit down with us. We have to have a pastor or some kind of mediator because the whole point is for her to see SO and I as a unit and not something she can get between. SO knows he would be stuck in the middle and that his mother would try to manipulate him to “her side” and he’s admitted to being bad at managing her. That’s part of the bullshit. 

She totally used him like her spouse for a good 10 years before he moved out. She even got me into her weird relationship with my SO when we stated dating (we were kids @15&amp;17) and didn’t realize she was a problem until we got close to our wedding. 8 years later. 

So the advice I’m looking for is how can we get through this? What can we do to convince her that she should meet with us- false pretenses or otherwise- she got offended that we want a mediator. That she “can’t have a conversation with her own son.” 🙄 

I’m still pissed. SO is feeling the guilt and slipping back into denial about her. I’m at such a loss. I want this nonsense over with.  Heck, I’d even appreciate ways to gently remind SO that his mom is not as nice as she pretends to be. 

Thanks! 💕",JUSTNOMIL
"I... Really don't know how to classify this, and I feel like garbage for even having to ask this question.
Mods, feel free to take this down if it's off topic. 
I just didn't know where else to put this.
But as the title asks, is it common for children of disabled parents to kind of resent them a bit?

Don't get me wrong, I resent Whiplash for some valid reasons that I'd like to work out with her some day, but her disability isn't one of those reasons.
My mom has the worst asthma that most doctors have ever seen. 
It's affected every area of her life from the obvious issues with her lungs(we can't have any perfumes/colognes, certain kinds of sprays, we even have to be careful what kind of essential oils we use) to the medications she uses actually making her body break down in some ways(She is now diabetic from one of her meds, and THAT is heaping side effects on her...).

It's all the more depressing when you consider that she used to be a track star and exercise nut. Now she gets an asthma attack from walking down the stairs some days.
She ended up missing a lot of stuff with my brothers and I because of the obvious health issues, and I can't imagine how SHE feels because of it.
I feel terribly for her, and I want to sympathize with her. I don't want to treat her badly or hate her or anything like that. I love my mom. Despite the garbage she's pulled in past stories(and likely more to come), I love her.

But part of me really resents her for how much we've missed out on together and how much our lives have been affected by it. 
The steroids she's had to be on for years can make her really nasty and short tempered, or she'll just sleep for most of the day some times.
I feel like I missed half of my childhood because of it. 
It might not have been so bad if she hadn't homeschooled me, but our school district was terrible and we didn't really have any other choice.

I feel so self centered for having to ask, but this has been brewing for a while now, and I want to take care of it before it gets any worse.

Feel free to lambaste me in the comments, I don't know what to think any more. I'm sorry if I'm the one out of line.",JUSTNOMIL
"Take a look at my post history if you’d like some context, but basically my mom is refusing to participate in my wedding—possibly because I’m marrying another woman—and is now pouting because I gave her duties to somebody else. I’m still very low contact with her, she doesn’t really reach out and I sure as hell don’t anymore. 

However, she’s taken to sending me pictures from when I was around 2-10 years old. Some of them I’ve never seen before (or if I did, it was so long ago that I don’t even remember), some of them with captions like “look how cute you are!” and “do you remember *insert friend name here*? you guys look great here!” etc etc. You get the point. I only responded once to them with a very quizzical “where are you even finding these?” and she didn’t even respond, she just sent me more pictures. I probably get around 4-5 a day at this point.

I just ignore the messages and pictures, but am I doing the right thing here? I don’t want to indulge her requests for contact and I feel like this is a way of her to try and open conversation with me, even though I’m nowhere near ready to speak to her after all the crap she’s pulled over the past months.

"Hey all! I just joined reddit like a week ago, so sorry if I do something wrong. 

Well, the title sound like something good, but it’s not quite like that. Let me give you some background. I’m married to the nicest man ever and we’ve been together for 10 years. We have a 3 yo son and we live a very happy life in a small town, far from his family but close to mine. His relation with his family is somewhat strange. MIL and FIL have been divorced for a while, FIL lives with new wife, and MIL used to live with the two younger siblings (F18, M16).  There are also two other brothers (26 and 34) living on their own. The thing is that on January we received a call from youngest brother , saying he wanted to visit us. DH was really happy, since he only gets to see his siblings about once a year.  I was also happy to see my DH getting things ready to greet his lil bro. 

When young BIL arrived we noticed things were not right with him. He was very thin and looked unhealthy.  Also, he was going to stay with us for a month but only brought a small backpack with two tshirts and a pair of pants. We got really worried and started asking him about his school year and stuff like that. Suddenly he says that he didn’t feel comfortable where he was living. Turns out my MIL had left a while ago, moved to a different country with new BF, and left the kids living with friends of hers.  Young BIL was thin cause he didn’t feel comfortable with the new family he was living with, so he left early in the morning for school and go back home late at night, only to sleep. You guys the poor kid wouldn’t even eat some days. 

Young BIL told us SIL was living with a different family, but later was taken in by my oldest BIL. She was doing fine til the moment. 

Of course we couldn’t let Young BIL go back there, so we asked him if he’d like to stay with us for good. He said yes, so we bought him clothes and school supplies so he could start the new year. He’s been doing great so far and looks happy. 

Now, my MIL  came back to the country during February, on vacation with new BF, but didn’t want to come to her own son’s birthday. She came by I ether day to say hi and bring souvenirs from her travels with new BF, and then left for good. 

I can’t believe that woman just abandoned her kids. I mean, why didn’t she say anything in the first place? Worst part is my young BIL still thinks his mom will take him with her to the new country :( 

That’s the story. Thanks for reading and hope I didn’t make any mistakes.",JUSTNOMIL
"I've posted before about my anxiety about ILs watching lo while I was in the hospital with lo#2. Well lo#2 came at 6 weeks early. TW: It was pretty traumatic with an emergency cesection due to preterm labor and cord avulsion. My ob said if I hadn't gone in when I did lo #2 wouldn't be here. It's been kind of hard to process.

At first I thought the ILs were amazing. They dropped everything to come immediately. The whole time I was in the hospital everything ""seemed"" to be going great. I felt like a big asshole. We had a pp doula contract which basically was a flop and no doulas were available, so ILs it was.

When I got out though it's become very obvious they cannot understand what I'm going through. Mil has made some pretty insensitive comments comparing her recent outpatient laproscopic surgery to my major abdominal surgery. She's compared the pain, compared staying on top of medicine, just really ridiculous things. Look i get any surgery is painful. I'm sure it was tough but an outpatient laproscopic surgery is nothing compared to a csection. It seems to both of them ""well mil just went through surgery and was able to do this, this, and this."" Like I should be able to. I'm moving around a ton more then I should be because lo is in the hospital but they seem to think I'm good to go. There has been little actual understanding of the difficulty, emotionally or physically. 

They visited lo in NICU five days pp and DH suggested they could go into the city for lunch afterwards and mil asked/expected us to be going as well. Me, five days pp from a csection with my baby in NICU. No thanks we are staying here to try to feed him and hold him.

DH had been having a discussion on preterm babies and mil commented how she was SO upset having a baby two weeks early, and how she just couldn't handle it and didn't know what to do. I mean I'm literally dealing with a 33 weeker in NICU, why would anyone say that to someone in my position? Like again I'm sure it sucked having a perfectly healthy 38weeker but it isn't the same.

Mil and fil have both seperately forgotten I can't watch lo alone. Mil while DH was at a conference one day that was just too planned to cancel. She was like fil and I can go get groceries later and I said well someone will have to stay to help watch lo and she laughed and was like oh that's right I forgot. Fil asked DH for a ride to the airport when they leave and DH said no because I can't watch lo alone and fil was like oh yea, ok.

Lo burned his hand on the oven and they didn't even notice. It's insane to me because he had blisters on the hand. I was LIVID but held it in because we are in such a precarious position. Los fingers have since mostly healed, it wasnt bad. But are you going to tell me he wasnt FREAKING out in pain from burning his hand and you all didn't notice? Or did they try to hide it? I don't know. Fil tried to say it didn't happen when mil was cooking and DH basically said yes there was no other possibility. Finally fil conceded but NEITHER apologized for letting my son burn himself. It was just like literally ""ohh I'm a bad grandma"" and expecting us to be like nooo it happens.

Lo has been having a blast with the ILS. He loves them, he's super hyped to have them here and acts up/crazy. DH and I get it, it's fine. But the ILs act like lo is perfect for them and is just uncontrollable when we are around. No sorry, you don't know my kid better, love my kid more. You are a novelty, I am his mother and a constant presence in his life. Fil the other day tried to tell me that lo only acts crazy for us and he's just great and ""it's simple"" for them. Right, because you all have only ever cared for him once and let him burn himself. Simple.

Lo also fell off a coffee table and bumped his head. He was okay but I was frustrated because fil was playing with him. Fil immediately said oh he hit his back not his head. DH and I were in the room just not close enough to get to him and saw him hit his head. Mil asked fil if lo was in his back and fil said no. Mil asap is like oh it was an accident, it's just an accident. Like covering for them, instead of asking if he's ok. 

The other day lo was fussy and DH was handling him because again, csection. DH is just complaining a bit about how tired he is. I don't mind because its been rough on both of us. But then mil is like I'll take lo, DH you must be SO tired. Poor DH. Okay, hello, what about the only person recovering from surgery with the actual excuse to be tired? This instance I said DH is fine, he can watch lo.

Similarly the day he had to travel mil is like oh DH has SUCH a rough day ahead of him. DH, driving to a work conference where he'll meet up with work friends he hasn't seen in a bit. As opposed to me, going by myself to NICU (well driven by mil) and trying to breastfeed my preemie and then leaving him there and going home to supervise my toddler, no that isn't hard.

Also, we have paid for every dinner but one. It's been costly. The ILs have offered to cook. But their cooking starts at 7 and dinners at 9. Even if we said dinner needed to be on the table by 7 it wouldn't be and then the cleanup. So DH and I have foot the bill for almost every dinner. With the exception of one and some groceries the ILs picked up for us. And we aren't working them to the bone. Mil has picked up a bit but we got the house deep cleaned like four days ago so it hasn't been bad. Lo has been in daycare all week so they went on many touristy trips borrowing one of our cars and came back in time to get him from daycare and watch him like two hours until we came home.

I keep telling DH that mil is just completely not in tune with how hard this is for me emotionally and physically. He gets it but again we are just biting our tongues so things don't turn sour. Not everything's been bad but it's added to the stress. They leave tomorrow afternoon but it's been a long trip. Sorry about the length and thanks for letting me vent a bit.

ETA since everyone has woken up this morning I've heard how ""wonderful"" it's been that they could come spend time here, how mil will come back whenever and for whatever, and how when we are ""hanging out"" in the hospital today can we send her a bunch of pics of lo(she's been asking for pics several times even though we've showed her several).

I forgot to add fil has been ""joking"" with my two year old telling him things like ""go away"" or ""don't sit next to me"" apparently it was just soooo funny and lo clung to him. Neither idiot thought hmm maybe a two year old has no Fing clue what I'm saying is sarcasm and is really confused why Grandpa is being mean and Grandma is letting him. When he did this in front of us we absolutely shut that shit down.",JUSTNOMIL
"About 3 months ago my husband and I went to an amusement park and left our now 1 year old with MIL. We have cameras in our home that activate as soon as we leave the house so of course when we took off they turned on and we kept getting alert every time they sensed movement. Husband and I weren’t checking the cameras that’s why it took us two hours to notice we hadn’t been getting alerts, my husband checked the cameras and didn’t see anyone so he started to review video and noticed his mom leaving with our son, he called his mom and asked how our son was doing because he didn’t want her to think we were spying. MIL didn’t mention she left our place she just said he was fine and playing with toys, husband gets off the phone with her and tells me what she said and I become livid, I called her about 5 times she didn’t answer husband calls her from his cell twice and still no answer so he calls his sister. SIL informs us that they are at her place because she got him some gift and wanted to see him open them. Husband gets on the phone with his mom let’s her know we are mad and what she did was not ok, she begins to apologize and says the reason she didn’t say anything was because she thought we had beef with his sister so she didn’t want us to know. Fast forward to about 3 weeks ago, his SIL FaceTimed me and at first I didn’t answer because she is toxic to me and I always end up upset every time I converse with her. Decided to give her a chance so I FaceTimed her back (MIL is at SIL’s house hanging out) after a couple minutes SIL is laughing and ask if I saw the photo she uploaded I saw no so she proceeds to show me a family photo my son is in that I’ve never seen before and I’m shocked! I get off the phone and look for the picture online, of course I’m not tagged it, my husband, MIL and BIL are all tagged and it’s a picture of all their kids with MIL. I get upset because 1. Husband and I have never taken family photos with our son and 2. She snuck him out of our home, change his outfit and took family photos with him the day husband and I were at the amusement park and didn’t mention this to us when we were on the phone with her and she was apologizing profusely. I have not mentioned anything to them but it still upsets me when I think about it. We are planning a trip back home and I’m not comfortable with MIL babysitting. SIL and I don’t have the best relationship, she’s a narcissist and both BIL and MIL are enablers 
Am I over reacting? He’s my first kid, I want as many firsts with him as I can get is that too much to ask for?",JUSTNOMIL
"My mom just got done staying with me for over a week and the whole time she was here I was so annoyed with her.  I am 6 weeks pregnant sahm so my hormones are crazy and I was trapped in the house with her all day every day.  I wanted her to visit and invited her here because I thought it would be nice to have someone to hang out with during the day but I guess I’m too irratable for that right now.  So here are some things she did that annoy me:

The worst thing was my husband needed to take a bath cause he had sore muscles from working in the yard all day, and after he was done we were all gonna watch a movie together.  I was explaining this to my mom after she had a few glasses of wine and she was like “well did you want to go take a bath with him?  Don’t not take on just cause me and your dad are here.”  I was like I don’t want to do that.  The. She was like -no no!! You can go take one with him!  I was like...I don’t want to. Then she was like “well did he invite you to take one with him?”  I was like “no!  He didn’t invite me and I don’t want to!!! “. I’m not fucking taking a bath with my husband while my parents are in the next room it’s just creeepy.  And why she wouldn’t let it go was even creepier.

She also had to comment on everything I did when I was here from going to the bathroom, to eating, to farting or burping.  Every 5 min “whatcha doin”. If I get up to go to the bathroom it’s “uh oh someone has to peeeee” or if I let out a fart or burp it’s “ohhh I heard that one!!!”  If I’m eating something it’s “what are you eating” or “ohh mommy’s hungry!!!”  As an introvert this annoys me to no end because I just want to do things in silence.

She is extremely nosy.  She went into my pantry just to look at what was in there and had to comment or ask about every item.  “Oh you’ve got chicken noodle soup!!!!!”  “Oh yummy!!!!  Belvita crackers!!!!!”  “Bean and bacon soup???  Bean and bacon soup?!??  Who likes bean and bacon soup!?!?!”  I felt like I had to explain every fucking thing I had in there or tell a fucking background story.  I don’t even remember where half the shit came from!  

I was opening a bunch of amazon boxes and she had to stand over my shoulder commenting on everything asking me to explain it.  Half the stuff was for my husband and stuff to tinker in the garage with and I did t really know what it was.  So I just kept saying “I don’t know” over and over again while she was like “what’s that?  What’s that for?  Who needs that?”  Then there was this box of onion soup mix that my husband ordered in bulk because he likes to mix it with sour cream to make onion dip.  My mom saw that and instantly had a million questions.  “Onion dip?”  I didn’t respond and was annoyed by this point.  “Onion dip????”  No response from me.  “Who likes onion dip????”  Me - “DH DOES”. Her -“well what does he do with it?  Does he like add stuff to it???”  Uagggggggghhhhhhhh SO ANNOYING!!!!  Why do I have to explain every thing in full fucking detail!!!!!!!!!!!

She has this app where she can track her friends and she spent the whole time looking at it every hour to see where everyone in my family was.  “Oh you’re sister is at work!!!  Oh her husbands at work to!!!  What’s your brother doing now let’s see!!”  

She and my dad constantly talk about every little detail about my sister and brother lives and what they are doing and how their life dedications suck.  They are having to basically do the adult if for them and help them get by in their lives and are wayyyyyy too involved in them.  It’s just so annoying because it’s like they don’t have lives of their own and my
Siblings are in their 30s.  I feel like they enable them to where they are struggling to support themselves.  Thankfully I live 300 miles from my parents and have a life of my own so I don’t have this problem.  But my brother lives with my parents and sister lives in the same apt complex so they do everything for them.  It was hard to even get them up here because they felt like they could not leave them behind for a week.

She told me that my brother left his fit bit on the counter at their apartment and that she sat there and read texts messages coming from his ex girlfriend.

She just randomly farts in the direction of my face when I’m sitting on the couch like 5 feet away

When we are watching a movie she asks a billion questions because she’s on her phone the whole
Time and can’t keep up.  Every single actor she’s like “oh it’s what’s his face from that one movie!!”  Then she has to google up whoever she thinks it is and usually it’s totally not anyone.  

Makes the same movie references or says phrases over and over again like a broken record.  “Oh no me bill!!!”  “Arms up don’t shoot”. For no fucking reason at all

We were making onion dip and she takes the stirring spoon, smears her finger on it and licks her finger and puts the spoon back in the dip

Kept rubbing my pregnant belly commenting “I wanna see the baaaaaaby” like over and over again multiple times a day

I was trying to give my dad our WiFi password and he’s old with fat fingers so it was taking a serious amount of concentration and she kept trying to interrupt us to show us something on her phone over and over and shoving the phone in our faces even though my dad was yelling a her going “stop it I’m trying to get the WiFi password”. She just kept doing it like a little 5 year old kid

She didn’t shower but once the whole time she was here

I’m sure there are many many other things but I can’t think of them now.  Sorry this is so long but after a week of this I needed to get this off my chest.  I feel so guilty for being this annoyed with her.  Mainly because I have always gotten along with my mom but whenever I’m pregnant I just can’t fucking stand her.

"I decided to tell mom I’m working today. I wanted to tell her before tomorrow, when I start working, otherwise I think it would have been worse. I thought that by telling her today beforehand, it might lessen the blow, and maybe they’d still let me use the car. 

She didn’t take it very well. I chose to tell her as we were going shopping in case it got bad. I tried to be vague and not give any specific information.

She said she would have to see if it was in a dangerous area, if it was then it’s not happening. She said she doesn’t trust me right now, she thought we were close, she’s hurt that I couldn’t trust her. She kept asking me when I got the interview, when was I gonna tell her, am I going to college in the fall or am I lying about that, is this just a summer job, did I even meet with an advisor or am I lying, why couldn’t I trust her. Most of my answers were “you don’t like it when I talk about jobs.” I told her I didn’t tell her because she told me no to the last job, she said she didn’t, she’s just trying to guide me to a wise path, I’m an inexperienced driver and they want me close to home. 

I can’t tell her the name of the place because then she’ll know it’s the same place she told me not to apply to. If she asks what the name is, I’m just gonna repeat, “It’s not a dangerous area, I checked.”

I’m kind of shaking right now. Dad’s probably gonna come up and yell at me after mom goes running to him to use him as a human shield, so he can be the one to say no, not her. They’re gonna talk me into quitting this job, which will look absolutely horrible on a resume, and then suggest a bunch of different jobs that aren’t even hiring or that don’t give me any of the experience or anything I’m looking for. They’re going to steam roll over me and then pretend like everything’s fine and they didn’t just control my choices. They’re going to keep saying “I just want to support you, I’m not trying to control you,” until they’re blue in the face. 

If they try to argue with me and tell me to quit, if they tell me I’m not allowed to use the car because they don’t trust me or something, then I don’t know. If they want me to quit, I’m just gonna say, “I can’t, it’s out of my hands.” I have a bike, but they’d never let me even go to the job. If it’s my independence versus letting mom and dad control my life as they insist they’re not, I don’t know if it’s worth staying here, quitting this job and finding something else, and saving up money, or just leaving and finding a shelter or something. It would suck because I’d have to leave so much behind, but maybe it would be better for me in the end. Honestly, they’re gonna do this with everything, aren’t they?

It might have been better just to lie and say I got a job close by, but I didn’t want them popping in a random store and looking for me, only to discover I was lying the whole time. I don’t know. I feel like I made a huge mistake, and I don’t know what to do.

Edit: Dad talked to me. He asked if I went to an advisor, because he was gonna be upset. I said I did. The majority of the talk was that I need to focus on my schoolwork, why do I even want to work, why do I even want a car when it’s a black hole of maintenance and car payments and insurance, I need to focus on college, why didn’t you tell us, etc. Dad didn’t say I had to quit, but he wants to know the name of the place. I’m pretty sure if it’s in a less than ideal area, they’re gonna make me quit though.

Edit 2: Mom came into my room and said to give her the name of the place. She snapped at me and said if I didn’t give her the name of the place then I’m not going. I gave her a coffee place I had already looked up, and it’s close to a police station so that’s better? She said “You know that’s not a bakery right?” I asked why she would mention that. I gave her the city. She said I have to give her the specific address, I asked why she needed it. She said there’s multiple, there’s not. She said she gave me specific parameters for getting a job (she didn’t? Unless the 30 minutes issue is her parameter?). She said I could have gotten a job at a cafe near her, I said this other place was the only one that contacted me back. She’s still really hung up on me getting a job at the cafe where she works, even though it’s further away than this one, and I already said I wanted to get in on my own talents, not through her. But I guess I’m just supposed to let her drive me everywhere? She’s ranting to my dad in the kitchen right now.

Edit 3: They’re gonna make me quit. They’ll never let me leave to get to the job. They want me to quit, they want me to focus on the college shit I never signed up for and am not even ready for, they want me to tell them what I’m doing, and I had better be telling the truth because mom says if she finds out I lied, “it’s going to be very damaging to our relationship” or whatever that means. Either I quit, when I wanted this job, and met with people, after all the shit I went through to get it, and I stay here and pretend everything is fucking peachy and how nice mommy and daddy get to dictate everything, or I just run away or something. Honestly I’d rather just leave. I don’t think I can stay here anymore. I’m sick of having to fight them, if I stay here I’m worried I might end up hurting myself or worse. I don’t have anyone to stay with but I’m willing to take those chances. I don’t want to stay here to find out what “damaging to our relationship” means. I didn’t fucking go to a counselor because I was considering taking my own life, and I just wanted them to stop asking about it, but we can’t tell them that, can we? They’ll think they did something wrong! Not only that but I absolutely love how, as they were telling me that the roads around the place I told them I’d be working at are dangerous, they said if I got into an accident I’d have my license revoked and they don’t have the money to repair the car.

MIL family is the total opposite. There’s gossip, outbursts, crying, spatting, sarcasm, and mooching money within her entire side of the family. Somehow MIL is always at the center of it and knows every drop of gossip and gets super emotionally involved. I get major panic attacks in this environment. It’s too emotional and kind of shocking, I mean this lady is 50 and brings all kinds of negativity into my household. I’m very lax and independent. It’s taken 3 years of establishing major boundaries, despite her displeasure, to only have to witness the mess 5-6 times a year.

Well I’m buying a house for my partner and I out of state. I’m letting her come to the inspection because I know she knows a lot about houses and cares for my partner. I want this to be a GOOD trip. This lady complains about everything. She gets a new mattress every year, judges teenagers loudly when they’re not dressed appropriately, and there’s always something wrong with the food/service. My plan is to let her have her say about the house, take it all with a grain of salt, and move forward accordingly.

"So I’m not really sure if this is the right place to post this, so if mods want to take it down I’m fine with that, but here we go

Also i wrote this kinda late at night so i apologize for any spelling and/or grammatical errors
(Also for likely excessive profanity)
And for how long it is


So as stated in the title, most of the time my mom is great, she’s nice, she’s supportive, etc. but lately she’s been different. (A little backstory, my mom has extremely bad asthma, to the point that she should be hospitalized and depression and she is taking medication for both) The medication fucks her up, and sometimes she drinks while on it (or so me and my sister suspect) which fucks her up even more. When she’s like that, she does shit she can’t remember; like getting into an accident in MY fucking car, which wasn’t as bad as it could have been but she still either refused to say what happened, or she was so fucked up she didn’t know what happened. She also gets very nasty to my sister when on them. One case in particular was really bad, i don’t really want to say the whole story but my dad had gone on a trip for work so it was just us, and once the cops left she ended up screaming at my sister and insulting her, and said that she would basically stop supporting her and parenting her. The next day, we really needed to get away from her so she drove us to her friends house and we hung out there. When we felt like we were ready to talk about it, she didn’t remember anything at all. In addition to all this, she may be getting a job in Africa, and if she does i might have to move there for a year, which i really don’t want to do for a few reasons. Obviously i don’t want to be away from my friends and shit, but mainly i don’t want to be living alone with her because i don’t know if i can handle her if she has an episode like she did, which i expressed to my dad but he still pushed me to go. Both her and my dad said they wouldn’t make me go if i really didn’t want to, but we’re in kind of a bad financial situation right now, and need the extra money, and i feel like if she doesn’t take the job because i don’t want to go, it’ll be my fault if anything bad happens as a cause of a lack of money. I’ve been really stressed over this for a long ass time, and i can’t say it to her because she takes things really hard and i feel like it’ll ruin our relationship. My dad’s tried to support me, but in all honesty he’s very bad at it and i usually don’t talk to him about shit like this. 

Oh yeah and the reason my sister wouldn’t be with us is she’s going to college soon

Any advice would be appreciated, in regards to moving or just dealing with her, thanks.",JUSTNOMIL
"My JNMIL is very entitled (I'm sure you can relate). After LO was born, it was clear that JNMIL expected LO and I to become enmeshed with her family and that she expected my JYfamily to disappear into thin air. (Spoiler alert: my family isn't going to disappear).

Anyway, before LO was born, DH and I agreed that we were going to follow the Helen Moon sleep-training schedule, which is aimed at getting a baby to sleep through the night by 6 weeks. We were totally into the idea and we started LO on the schedule when he was 2weeks old. 

JNMIL was in town to ""help"" for the first 7 weeks of LO's life. During her visit, she kept making comments about how she never had her babies on a schedule. She's literally the last person I'd want parenting advice from. JNMIL also undermined LO's schedule any chance that she could. For example, she'd insist on babysitting and then wouldn't put LO down for a nap and/or kept him up until 9:30pm. It was annoying af. SIL also came to visit for 10 days during JNMIL's stay. She's a know-it-all and worked as a nanny once, so OF COURSE she also criticized the fact that we had LO on a schedule. 

As a result of JNMIL and SIL's criticism, DH suddenly became anti-schedule. This created conflict between DH and I. It was bad.

Despite the naysayers, I kept LO on the schedule and he was sleeping through the night by the time he was 2 months old. LO is now 5 months old and is still sleeping through the night. Yay! (Thank You Helen Moon!)

DH and I just took LO on his first flight to NYC to visit my JYGrandma. My brother and his wife and their infant son also came for the day. My JYGrandma 
 was soooo excited to see us and to meet two of her great grandchildren. 

Anyway, my JYGrandma worked with children for almost her entire life  and owned a daycare at one time. She's in her 90s, but is still super sharp and surprisingly up-to-date on childcare stuff, like SIDS risks, measles outbreaks, etc. She was also very observant about stuff with LO and my brother's baby. She's a baby guru. 

So during our visit, I asked my JYGrandma to give me the one piece of childcare advice that she believes to be the most valuable. You know what she said? DO YOU KNOW WHAT SHE SAID?!!! She said, that it's really important to keep the baby on a SCHEDULE because it provides predictability, which is good for both mom and baby.  bwahaha
I made damn sure that DH heard her.

"Im so annoyed right now.

Anyways, still in NC with them but somehow, through paternal GMIL, Bitchmouth and FIL can still see photos and videos of LO. Since she apparently forwards my photos and videos to them.

Last weekend, Saturday night, we spent the weekend at GMIL's house. DH asked to borrow her laptop to send work emails since his phone wont connect to the wifi.

She left her chrome site open and so is her fb. We are not one to snoop but as he was about to log out,something caught my eye.

It was the smiling photo of my own daughter. It immediately caught my attention of course,especially since I took the pic while she was in a good mood.

It was on her news feed. Apparently Bitchmouth received it and decided to upload it on fb for everyone to think we are still in contact with them.

There were hundreds of likes, comments saying how cute my daughter is. But some really caught my attention.

Commenter 1 - oh wow i want to see your beautiful grandkid!
Bitchmouth - ill borrow her soon and spend the 
weekend there with you guys.

Commenter 2 - what a lovely baby
Bitchmouth - of course my baby is an angel!

Commenter 3 - wow proud grandmom x hope to see you both soon! Wanna kiss her! Can i?
Bitchmouth - we will smother her with kisses soon! Ill bring her there the first chance I get.

I was so infuriated and annoyed I almost commented using GMIL's account! I told DH I wanted to break NC just to tell her to fuck off and she wont be bringing our daughter anywhere meeting strangers in a different city. My daughter is not a fucking toy. My daughter isnt yours. My daughter will never, ever be left alone with you guys.

I cant blame GMIL because she is an 85 year old woman who doesnt need to be dragged into this. FIL hates her and she only tries to have a relationship by trying to message them once in awhile. Sending pics and such. She is clueless and I dont want her to cry over that now.

My DH said it isnt really worth the trouble unblocking her and blocking her again since they never listen and will use it as an excuse to guilt us even more.

Im just so annoyed atm when remembering it. Fucking hypocrite. You can only see her through forwarded images. You will never get to see her or even get to bring her out of your door.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hello, everyone. Sorry if this is not the right place, is slightly ranty, and a bit jumbled. I'm just going to put it out there and could use any advice or feedback.  I added the Korean part because I feel like it might be impacting the situation. Sorry if I used the wrong flair. I'm including old and new information.DH and I recently had DS four months ago. When MIL found out we were pregnant she was happy as DS is her first grandbaby, SIL wasn't planning on having kids for a few years. After finding out it was a boy she was even happier and said god answered her prayers now we'd have someone to take care of us when we got old. IL don't have a lot in terms of retirement because god will provide and if they need help DH will take care of them, which is an issue for another time. We lived a few states away close to my family but after the finding out about the baby she started pestering DH about moving back near IL. DH was already planning on looking for a new job and decided to include his home state/locations within about an hour of IL. MIL was a medical condition which requires dialysis, leaves her one arm weakened, and we thought was quiet severe so we decided to move back.

DH found a job within 30 minutes of MIL and the job wanted him to start right away. MIL started prodding DH about moving in instead of getting our own place that way she could see grandbaby all the time. She would even waive rent. ""Luckily"" we have cats and MIL does not want any pets in her house and said we could just get rid of them. Due to DH job we ended up moving when DS was a month old.  I'll admit the first month was very overwhelming, DH and I had never been around kids and I was trying to recover from the c-section while figuring out how to properly pump (always planned on breastfeeding). I spent more time crying and feeling like a failure as a mom than I'd like to admit.

DS cried a lot the first month and we tried getting advice from MIL and she told DH that we should just let him cry it out - leading to a few fights with DH as he said it should work while I thought we should be finding ways to stop the crying. We tried to keep MIL involved the first month by sending picture though every time we sent her a picture of DS looking cute or adorable there was always something we were doing wrong whether it was he needed more or less clothes, shouldn't be using a pacifier (we were bottle and formula feeding by this point and using the pacifier the nurses used on him in the hospital), or we were holding him wrong (DH was laying DS's arm against the chest). It was additional stress, but oh well we'd move on.

We didn't have a place right away so we ended up staying with IL for a few weeks and boarding our cats. DH went back to old apartment for a few days during this time. Up to this point MIL was only a slight bit annoying but after our stay I feel like maybe I've tainted future events. When DH and I first got here MIL and FIL were really excited and wanting to hold the baby, though we warned MIL that she should be careful because he's a bit heavy. Overall the first few days weren't bad DS behaved pretty well. The main issues having just been building up over the next week until we moved out and then still buildup when we have them babysit every Sunday.

**Here's the things that make me question whether I'm overacting or MIL goes over the top**:

Past

Always takes DS when he starts crying even when he's with someone else. We say no and she either just stays there and continuing to ask or starts grabbing DS out of our hands. When DH was gone MIL took DS out of my hands and would leave the room with DS.  I'd been in the bedroom and she'd take DS to common room. MIL would come into the bedroom even when we said no if DS was crying. The first night DH told her he was letting DS cry it out like she told him, she said she never told him that and we should give DS to MIL to calm. SIL/DH said we should just let her take the baby if he starts crying even though I want to learn how to get better about calming and caring for DS. It would be one thing if MIL would try to teach but she just takes over and it feels like she's trying to mother my child.

DS loves to sleep in a Glider, we tried Bassinet and Pack and Play but he just stayed awake and cried. MIL said the Glider was terrible and made his legs cramp up. When DS layed on me he did frog legs and MIL said that was bad and he needs to straighten out his legs.  MIL told me DS always wakes up angry (he cries) because he's in so much pain because we keep him a cramped Glider that when he cries he's saying ""Ouch Mommy. Ouch."" I tried telling MIL he's just hungry but MIL said most babies wake up happy and calm. MIL started straightening his legs while sleep (constantly rubbing his legs and using a tight swaddle). These went out for about three days while DH was away (I felt really crappy because I thought I was causing DS a lot of pain). I told her to stop doing it and it was bad after I looked it up and found out it could cause hip problems but she kept doing it same with pointing his member upward when changing diapers even after I asked her to stop. She'd say okay I understand and then kept doing it. When DH got home I asked him to tell her to stop and the issues with straightening the legs, she did but then she kept doing the diaper changing thing because that's how Korean doctors told her to do it even though we told her repeatedly to stop.

Present

We bring DS over to IL every Sunday so they can maintain a close relationship. Every time we bring DS there's always some big thing we've done wrong. One week its that he should be wearing socks, next week pants, next week mittens, and etc even though he was wearing the exact same thing he was wearing when he stayed there a few months earlier and it was colder and it was fine. Once we seem to do one thing MIL wants then another things crops up.  MIL always used to tell DH he should get his eyebrows tattooed because they were very thin (they look normal) but MIL keeps obsessing about it now MIL talks about how DS needs to get a nose job because its a little button nose instead of sharp nose like MIL.  She also keeps making comments about how he needs to diet (he's big for his age but completely healthy) which was an okay ""joke"" at first but she keeps doing it.

We tried bringing some books over so she could read to DS but she tells us were doing it way to early and shouldn't even start trying until 6 mo though I think its important to start right away. Essentially the only thing DS does at IL is getting carried around. The tummy time mat is used as a changing pad, because MIL things DS has to have a pillow every time he lays down, with a blanket over him and then a pillow on top of his chest. I tried explaining that DS should only be sleeping with at most a swaddle cloth if its swaddled but she insists it keeps him asleep longer even though I told her its not safe. Now, if she stayed in the room and watched him I feel better but she leaves him and cooks or cleans in the kitchen while he's sleeping.

I used to like MIL/FIL watching DS on Sundays but lately it feels more like a chore. We have to make sure DS gets a bath in the morning then is it an outfit MIL will approve of while double checking to make sure we don't forget any of the random items she deems necessary (she swears he loves the rattler and has to have it each time - he doesn't like it). We used to treat it like a date day and get some shopping in as well. Now MIL always has to cook something every time we come over, even though we've told her repeatedly we planned on dinning out together which we never get to do alone anymore, and guilt us if we don't eat.  Even if we don't eat we have to stay around while MIL/FIL eat even though MIL will spend 30 minutes just adoring DS (cute but we're on a timetable) before eating and we spend about 30 more minutes after talking with IL about life/etc as we don't want to be rude and just drop off DS. We used to get four hours to spend with each other and get tasks done such as vacuuming or buying groceries now we get maybe two hours and that's if we come back later in the day.

DS started chewing on items including grabbing fingers and putting them in his mouth. I've started making sure my hands/nails are clean and short in anticipate. DS was fussy when we went to IL Sunday. When MIL say that he was chewing on my fingers she got upset and said that was a bad idea. She told us DS was getting fussy because I probably hurt his gums when was chewing on my fingers even though he's been fussy before I started letting him do that and he's not constantly fussy. She said to stop it and not let him do it anymore as I'm hurting him.

Issue

DH and I are fortunate in that financially I am able to be a STAP with relative ease. As DS is our first child I already feel like I'm letting him down by not knowing all these things I feel I'm supposed to know then MIL comes along and makes me feel like crap then I later find out she was wrong. DH is starting to get annoyed because he says I always have to prove her wrong and that I need to relax. The problem is I find being around MIL incredibly frustrating as she's always poking at something we're doing and not in a helpful constructive manner but in a tear you down manner like telling us DS hates the formula type we feed him even though he eats it just fine at home or telling us we're hurting him by not putting pillows under his head when we change his diapers.

MIL recently let us know that FIL/MIL are thinking about retiring with FIL getting a part time job elsewhere and MIL getting paid to watch DS while I go back to work. Now the idea of someone we trust watching DS and working again is tempting as I feel that I might become too dependent on DH and I know it might be a problem finding a job when DS goes back to school, I don't like the idea of MIL watching DS. FIL always offsets MIL which is why the day stay doesn't bother but I feel like MIL would try to take over parenting DS. Also, we plan on having more kids and with MIL medical issue I don't see how it would make sense. I don't think MIL was a good mother as she's very judgmental, nit picky, stressful, and seems unfamiliar with kids (she kept telling us things DS should be doing even though it was months down the line). I'm not sure if I'm the jerk because I don't want her to watch my kids all day long. If she's already telling me after spending five hours a week with DS what he loves and hates, I can only imagine how it will be if she's constantly watching him.

Lastly, MIL/FIL immigrated to US about 20 years ago and know very little English which I think contributes to the issues because MIL speaks about me to DH in Korean knowing I can't understand what she's saying sometimes intentionally as she gets mad at DH for translating (calling me fat, etc). One time when MIL took DS because he was getting fussing I told SIL I didn't like when she did that but SIL said it was because MIL thought he was in pain and didn't know how to tell me even though MIL LITERALLY told me in English a month prior that she thought DS was in pain. At first MIL said she wanted to try speaking more English which she did for a day but now continues to speak total Korean and just waits for DH to translate. FIL is better and at least tries using English with DH and I unless MIL is around then again all of them have conversations about DS in Korean. 

Sorry for the long post. Am I overreacting? Is this normal Mom/MIL things? Am I the problem?",JUSTNOMIL
"Okay. So I have dealt with a lot of shit with my Step-Mom. Let me give a bit of background first.

Parents divorced when I was 6. Turns out Dad was sleeping with one of my (very very JY) Mom's best friends, and wanted to marry her, so he divorced my Mom, married Step-Mom. Their wedding was the worst day of my life. I hated every moment of it. Let it be known my Father is an abusive (verbally) manipulative asshole.

So we start having visitation at my Dad/Step-Moms, and she drives me bonkers right off the bat treating me like a child. Cutting up my meat into itty bitty pieces at dinner, not trusting that I can clean myself well enough in the shower (my older sis would help if I needed it, no way was I letting SM in there) etc etc. Three of my step siblings are around my age (2 yrs older, same age, 1 yr younger)

I was accused of stealing bath salts (in reality I knocked them over and cleaned them up), and was told I wouldn't be welcome until I apologized.

At Christmas time my sis and I would get 1-3 presents each, step siblings (5 of them) would get 10+ presents and a full stocking (we had no stocking at my Dad's).

You get the picture.

Well a few years back I discovered I love knitting. Guess who knits tons? Yup. Step Mom. So now she is always sending me patterns, giving yarn etc. One thing she has going for her is she always remembers I am allergic to wool, so that's nice.

But the thing is... I don't want anything from her. We didn't even see them at Christmas this past year. I got a text with an EMT on my bday for $50 from my Dad.

But I still have to see them occasionally as my step-sis is getting married in July, and I'm thinking my step-bro will be next and/or me, and I want my step siblings at my wedding so kinda have to have dad and step mom.

How would I tell her this without making it awkward? Just avoid saying anything? AUGH. I really really don't like this woman and don't WANT to like her as she totally betrayed my Mom whom I love more than anything else in this world.  


Edit: Meant to add: Is it possible she's turning into a JY as I get older? I'm 25 now so maybe she wants to get along with adult me?",JUSTNOMIL
"Trigger: Physical Abuse

We recently visited my ILs for Memorial Day, and I’ve recently gone gluten free for health reasons and MIL made a huge deal out of that. My allergies aside, MIL is a little on the handsy side. She’s been smacking SO in the head for his entire lifetime, and he HATES it. She hit SO again, and he told her not to do it again. Then SO goes to the restroom and she hits me in the head?! So I tell her (in his presence) that I’ve had concussions and would not like her to do that again. She apologizes, whatever, still inappropriate. 

After our visit, I get in the car and just bawl, because she’s made a huge deal out of my allergies and has offered to make me a birthday cake (even though she doesn’t cook for anyone) and just everything that happened. My SO didn’t realize she hit me and this comes out in the car on the way home. Well after we got home he texted her and told her that her behavior was unacceptable and that the next time it happened we were just gonna leave. She goes a little wack, but he stood by his decision! 

Making slow progress! I’m super ticked she hit me, especially because I’ve been abused in the past, but SO stood up for me, and I’m really happy that we’re getting somewhere.  

Now I just have to stop her from baking me a birthday cake, as it is kind of weird since she refuses to cook for anyone else. (and I’m scared she’ll poison me)",JUSTNOMIL
"For all intents and purposes it's normally FIL that is outspoken without a filter and is unable to read body language or the nuance of the situation.

This time it was his GF.

About 10 of us went out for a meal, including my 3 week old son (who's place was booked just so I had somewhere to put his car seat).

I packed an abundance of nappies, wipes, 1 dummy as he tends to reject them any way, and 1 bib. I only packed 40ml of milk.

I only had 40ml as that's all I had managed to collectively pump all day after breastfeeding. I feel shit about this as I had a chronic over supply recent to a hospital visit that has completely fucked up my production. I definitely make enough to keep him fed but pumping is now providing a pittance of what it used to.

Ive felt an overwhelming amount of guilt and stress that now I don't seem to be able to relinquish any of the night feeds to my SO, but also I have no stock so if I were to be hospitalised or away my SO would have tremendous difficulty feeding a stubborn baby formula which has been tried and refused on many occasions.

Cue today: I was seated next to  (FILs GF, FMIL). My son was sleeping in his car seat next to me where I could get to him if he woke up or if I felt he'd been in there too long. FMIL went over to coo, and poke and prod, and unbuckle, and pick up and wake up.

... Whatever, she's excited, he's new, it's an outing. Bound to happen.

The comments started slow and steady. Nothing too brash or judgemental.

""his shoes are cute, but they shouldn't wear shoes this young.""

OK, I know this, but they weren't hard bottomed walking shoes, they were soft bottomed slippers that didn't change the shape of the foot.

She heads over and picks up his blanket to wrap him in. I said I think it's too warm to have his blanket on. I was sweating in jeans and a T shirt, he was wearing a vest and dungarees in an non-airconditioned building. She proceeds to wrap him in it.

At this point I'm getting annoyed because she didn't even acknowledge I had spoken to her and outright went against my wishes for my son. I kept quiet, because people soon get sick of holding your kids and pass them back.

I was right. My son started rooting. Something I hoped he wouldn't do for a while, as I'd fed him before we left and was hoping he'd be asleep in his car seat for at least half an hour.

""oh look he's hungry"" she said.

""I know but he's just eaten, and he's sick if we give him too much at a time. The midwives have advised little but often."" - actual advice, but I was just trying to make my 40ml stretch.

""no no, he's hungry, you should feed him before he gets upset.""

Whatever. My food is on its way any way and I wanted to get him settled again so I could enjoy it. I started feeding him his 40ml.

I get him into a comfy position and start feeding him, and SHE STARTS PULLING HIS LEGS. He's sucking and sucking and I'm wondering why he's slipping then I look down and she's gripping his legs and tugging them. We lock eyes and she stops and turns her attention to his socks which were folded neatly, and she starts unfolding them and pulling them up his leg. ""he's much cuter this way.""

Bitch. No.

At this point I'm eating ground molars for lunch.

Finally he finishes his bottle and I sit him up to burp him and he starts rooting again and decides to nom down on my fingers.

""do not put your fingers in his mouth. He's still hungry. Where's the rest of the milk."" well bitch, if you must know, I'm not making enough because I was put under a lot of stress which hindered my supply.

She went on: ""oh baby, is mummy naughty. Did she not bring you enough milk. You hungry hungry boy.""

I manage to settle him with his dummy, and get him into his car seat long enough for us to eat. After eating I went to the loo and asked a member of staff where the baby change was to which she said they didn't have one. People don't bring babies often so they don't have one.

That's a crock of shit if ever I heard one. There were 3 other babies in the building and whenever we eat there, we see full families there. There wasn't space to change him in the women's either, so I head back to the table hoping he's still asleep. He is, thankfully, and we don't live far away so I didn't think that was a big deal, but he was due to fill a nappy any time so I prepped SO in case we needed to make a getaway.

""what's that on his leg?"" she says as she's peering over. 

""what's what?""

""he's got a rash on his leg, how couldn't you notice? It looks bad.""

I looked over and he had a red friction mark EXACTLY where she'd been grabbing him, but I kept my mouth shut and said it looks like his clothes had rubbed him, and he doesn't seem phased so I'll check it when we're home.

"" if he were MY baby... ""   here we go.  ""I'd use XYZ on those rashes AND I'd carry it with me where ever I go in my handbag.""

Ok I feel like a piece of shit cos apparently I don't carry all the necessities for every event AND I've not brought or even made enough milk for my hungry son by this point. 

My son started crying because he'd been shoved back in his stuffy car seat on a warm day, and I looked at SO and asked if we were ready to go... Before FMIL opens here mouth again. 

""does he cry when he needs his nappy changing? You haven't changed a nappy yet."" 

""no he doesn't cry, we're quite regular with checking though. I'll change him once we're home. We're only 5 mins away.""

""oh baby, is mummy putting you in the car with a dirty nappy?"" 

I asked SO if we could go again, this time I didn't even make it subtle that I was uncomfy with the conversation. 

I stood up. 

She pulled on my clothes. 

"" oh Mrsbettatohead your clothes are soooo baggy. You really need new ones.""

Look bitch. What do you expect? I'm 3 weeks postpartum. I've got an infected c section incision I'm trying not to rub. I'm doing my best. What do you want?

At this point I picked up my son in his car seat and walked off down stairs and waited for SO to come so I could book a taxi and get the fuck out of there. 

I broke down crying in the taxi. Props to the uber driver for disregarding the awkward atmosphere I had created. 5 stars and a tip to you my man. 

I have never been subject to so much judgement in such a short space of time in my life. 

Somehow even though SO was sat directly opposite me he missed every one of her judgy interactions with me. 

She completely ruined my evening and has made me feel like the only place for me and my son is to stay stuck inside our house for the next year.

"So I’m in kind of a sticky situation. We rent from my mother-in-law (it was her house that she lived in for 30 years and she moved about three hours away). We had been looking to move closer to work and when she suggested renting this house, it seemed to be a dream come true. 

She decided that she can come whenever she wants.  And there’s no stopping her by saying we’re busy, she would come anyway. And she is welcome but she’s so invasive I want to scream. She goes through my stuff and does this weird inventory of what “is new” since her last visit. She comes to stay every 6 weeks. 

She’s passive aggressive and makes cutting comments to me. She’s 69 but active but absolutely no help. She wants to be entertained and gets pissed off if we have other plans. Or she will act hurt if we try to do chores, errands, or anything that doesn’t involve us sitting on the couch and listening to her talk. She doesn’t help with my kids or help in any way. She expects to be waited on and catered to. So after her visits I feel drained and emotionally exhausted. She was supposed to leave yesterday morning but didn’t leave until 6pm.

Also,she favors my oldest daughter over the younger. 
She also invites nearby family over for cookouts at our house and tries to have her other grandkids spend the night. We just put our dog down of 14 years so we have been dealing with grief and told her we didn’t want a cookout but she still invited people over and gave them house tours.

Reading this I know it sounds like we are pushovers and we are. But I don’t know how to deal with it.  My husband just tries to get through the visit. She’s renting us this house for a lot cheaper than we could find so she’s doing us a favor but I don’t think she has the right to go through my stuff/ just come whenever she wants. But if I say anything, she’ll get upset, cry, and say she’s not welcome. 

Advice is appreciated. Thank you.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hey all! I posted for the first time awhile ago talking about my FMIL- how she stole my engagement ring. In that post I elaborated about how we (me and fiancé, plus fiancés brother) have been living with her but contributing to the bills so we could eventually save money for a house.

Just this past Friday, we had a situation in which I need to know if I’m being crazy because everyone keeps acting as if I’m in the wrong. 

For a little backstory: my FMIL used to keep a young kid a couple years ago, before me and fiancé had even met. She had kept this kid from age 1-2. The kid was her best friends grandson, and FMIL doted on him and bought him things but ultimately, my fiancé was the one who was usually taking care of the kid due to the fact that FMIL was off dating and going out with friends and what not. When the kid turned 2, FMIL’s best friend stopped letting the kid stay at FMIL’s house because FMIL stole and married her best friends fiancé. They obviously fell out and then FMIL moved to another state for a year before moving back after she discovered her husband had- surprise, surprise- cheated on her. That about sums up the backstory.

Getting on to recently- we had to move out of the previous house and into a new one because FMIL didn’t pay her rent and got us evicted. So at this new house we have to pay even more than we did at the old one because it’s more expensive since we have dogs. My fiancé has 2 large winter dogs that are sweet as can be and I have an old chihuahua who is cranky and takes awhile to warm up to people, but won’t bite unless provoked. Now- FMIL makes decent money working at a large company and makes $2.5k a month. Fiancé and I make about $1k a month combined depending on how many hours he can get while FBIL works in a factory and brings in about $500 more than me and fiancé a month. The agreement at this new house was that FMIL would pay the rent ($1k) and me, fiancé, and FBIL would work together to pay utilities ($500 a month)- and if FMIL didn’t have enough for rent then we would help cover the rest. This doesn’t seem like a lot but fiancé and I’s car payment and car insurance combined is ~$650 a month and buy groceries for the whole house so it stretches us thin in terms of trying to save for a house. I come from a family where people who contribute have a say in the goings on in the household. FMIL has been up on payments so far but still has to pay rent on the first and will only have enough money with 2 paychecks- and she has called in 2 times this past week already.

So recently, FMIL has started becoming friends with her old best friend again because they work in the same place. FMIL hasn’t stopped talking about the kid for about 3 weeks. Well on Thursday evening I guess FMIL finally convinced her friend to let the kid stay the night so FMIL called into work so she could keep the kid (she works nights) So when I get home on Thursday at around 8 pm (I’m a full time nanny for 2 young boys) we get out of the car and FMIL comes running out of the house and says “Chihuahua bit {kids name}!!” Now, our dogs are crate trained and stay in the crates when we’re asleep and when we’re not home. When my chihuahua is faced with an uncomfortable situation, he stays in the crate and doesn’t come out. He will only bite if cornered or if someone tries to pull him out of his crate. So of course, I’m immediately very upset because my chihuahua biting the kid means one of two things- 1) the kid tried to pull him out of his crate or 2) the kid cornered chihuahua and got bit. So my immediate reaction was “Why would you let him out of his crate?” Because she knows how he is. And she just looks at me and shrugs.  Then fiancé tells her that she needs to not call out anymore because we don’t have enough money to make up for that much lost pay (about ~$400 that week) and she just huffs and says “are you all done lecturing a grown ass woman now?”

We go inside the house and it is a WRECK. Not only has this woman called into work, she has bought the kid toys and a video game- more money out of the pocket. There were empty KFC wrappers all over the place and toy cartridges and a lot. I hate messes so I immediately get started cleaning up and everything while they just sit in the living room where the kid plays his video game very loudly shrieking in a high pitched manner the way kids do. Now our house is only a 3 bedroom so the kid was going to have to sleep on the couch in the living room which is also where the dogs sleep. After cleaning up everything and putting my chihuahua in our bedroom, I start getting ready for bed around 10 pm-I work 7:30 am to 5:30 pm everyday and have to get up relatively early to ensure that I’m not late. My fiancé comes and lays with me, in which we talk and I tell him that he needs to talk to his mother about the kid staying here because having the kid is 1) a legal liability, especially when it comes to the dog bite and 2) against our lease terms (no babysitting on the property). He said that he would talk to her about it. We don’t fall asleep until 1 am because the kid is screaming at the video game and it echoes through the house.

The next day (Friday) I’m at work after having taken the older boy to his morning activity when my fiancé texted me and said that his mom was taking the kid home- which I was glad about because personally watching kids all day and then going home to being around another kid is just absolutely exhausting. So I thought all was good and well.

All was not good and well.

I got off early on Friday which is unusual for my job but I went home and took care of dishes and cleaned up the blankets in the living room and put all the toys that the kid forgot in FMIL’s bedroom then go lay in bed for a nap.

At around 4:30, I wake up to a kid yelling very loudly. So I get up and run to the kitchen where the kid has my dog corned at the stove and growling and my FMIL is chastising my dog. I snatch my chihuahua up and go and put him in his kennel, and then I ask FMIL how long the kid was staying for. She said “I don’t know, why?” I didn’t really want to cause a scene in front of the kid so I asked her if we could talk in her room privately.

Once in her room I told her that I didn’t think it was appropriate to keep this kid here, and that it was against our lease. This next bit will be easier in script form.
FMIL:  This is my {kid name} and nobody can tell me I can’t have him 

Me: as a contributing member of this household, I feel that you can not just make unanimous decisions for everyone and move a kid in

FMIL: I can do whatever the fuck I want, this is my house

Me: if this is your house than you can pay all the bills by yourself

FMIL: oh really?

At this point she started to leave the room and I followed her saying “I do not want to live with a kid- this is not something you can just do”

FMIL: I don’t want to live with your dog then 

Me: Fine, I’ll leave.

FMIL: fine, that is your option. You can’t fucking tell me what to do in my house. This is what I want to do and I don’t have to talk to anyone before doing anything I want to do 

Me: you always do what you want to do. You never fucking think of anything but yourself and what you want to do.

After that I packed up my bag and my chihuahua and drove over to my parents house (only about 15 minutes away from the new house) and called my fiancé (he was at work) to let him know the situation and tell him we could talk more about it after work.

Fiancé talked to FMIL about it and she said that she would only keep the kid on the weekends- which sounds like a compromise, but weekends are my only time off (fiancé works weekends) and dealing with a kid and having to confine my  dog and myself to my room because the living room is being monopolized by FMIL and a kid that is of no relation to us that she hasn’t even seen in years is not a compromise to me- and even if it were, FMIL is a liar and will likely call our at least once a week to keep kid on a weekday despite everyone having to work early.

Ever since then I’ve been staying at my parents house with fiancé coming and seeing me every now and then. Fiancé and his grandma (who found out because FMIL doesn’t know anything about private matters and has to blast drama to anyone who will listen) keep saying that I just need to move on and “that’s just how FMIL is” and “you just have to mind your own business and not let it bother you” which is frustrating to me because I feel like my feelings are being invalidated! This is a big deal to me and everyone is just acting like I’m being ridiculous.

I know that I could have probably handled this situation a lot more graciously and that I did lose my cool a bit when talking to FMIL but this is honestly just the frosting on the shit cake with me. In whole truth, FMIL is like a roommate I can’t stand- irresponsible, messy, rude and selfish. She doesn’t care about anyone but herself and never takes responsibility for her actions. I have told fiancé that this is about more than just the kid staying over for me- it’s about the fact that she just does whatever she wants without even considering anyone’s feelings about it and I’m done being treated like my feelings don’t matter. But after listening to fiancé and his grandma continually tell me to just let it go, I am now here to ask if you think I am over reacting to?",JUSTNOMIL
"Note: I'm still looking for a nickname for my MIL, I'm fond of Olacomplex but simply can't make up my mind yet.

Anyhow, the saga continued, and this post will consist of several small JN moments but will give you a pretty good idea of how off the charts crazy this woman is. We rocked (as we still do) the living together and relationship thing, kicking worlds butt and starting to get an idea about our future. My DH while finishing his studies (IT development) got a amazing and well paying job at a big advertising company working for big international clients, I was studying with a nice scholarship, working part time in my future line of work. We had it good, and any parent would be damn proud if their kids did so well so early in life. Any parent but MIL. 

After the visit things started to slowly get annoying. She would call her baby boy every day twice at least, keeping him on the phone forever. She  of course wouldn't call when I was out, no, it was literally  every day when we got home from work and in the evening. Like late evening. It got annoying, but DH, back then still lacking a shiny spine, picked up because he didn't want trouble. We had to drive 2h back home every weekend so we could sit at their house, where she made me feel really unwelcome, and she could snoop around in our life. Fine. I didn't really care since we stayed over at my moms place and I got to see my friends every weekend.

One weekend we had to go shopping to IKEA, what is in a bigger city about 30min drive. She begged us she could join, she would also take her big car so we can load all the stuff in and the we could do some shopping. It sounded like a nightmare, but I was also a way for her to finally get to like me (wow, I was so idiotic) and she did have a really big car. I agreed. We drive there and things are kinda ok, she wants to force her style on us while buying furniture, keeps her never-ending stories going for the whole day etc.. But ok, we make it out of IKEA and go shopping for (what I thought would be her) clothes. Turns out she decided to buy DH a whole new wardrobe, he apparently needed it. Thats where the fiasco started. Note - we are talking about a 24 year old man who completely stands on his own feet. First we went to the shoe store, where she found the most damn ugly sneakers I've ever seen, she makes him sit down, takes his shoe off and puts the new sneaker on. Then makes him walk around the store.. you get the idea right? After that we went to look for pants. I still feel like vomiting just remembering it. She picks out jeans then FOLLOWS HIM INTO THE CHANGING BOOTH to help with fitting. She makes him step out of the booth, pulls his pants up, puts her HAND IN HIS PANTS to ADJUST. I was done. I didn't say a word and wanted to break up with him after. It was disgusting and disturbing.

Some other weekend we were visiting her she decided it was time for her son to pick a career. She found a job for him, where he would go out of the country doing physical work. My DH was like ""but mom, I already got a job. A good one."" MIL:""That's not a real job and it can't last. You have to take this, it's a great opportunity."" I was just rolling my eyes, he politely refused and we never spoke of it. But I know she kept nagging him about it for years.

At some point she got to meet my family, first parents then grandparents and aunt too. She acted all sweet and my mom couldn't understand why I don't like her. She was sitting there and explaining to everyone what I great girl I was and how she's happy DH found me. I maybe was naive but I wasn't delusional, so I waited for the big blow. It didn't come for years. She made a detailed plan on hot to break apart my loving and extremely close family. First she tried sucking up to my parents, but that didn't work beyond her being tolerated by them. So she found the next best thing - my grandmother who was just starting to battle dementia, is a sweet old woman who loves me and a easy target. I watched how they would start to visit each other, go on trips etc.. After a while my grandma stopped calling me, she turned against my mom. We did some investigation and learned that she firmly believed I was a horrible selfish person and hated her for some things that happened in my childhood. My mom was the devil for buying her a brand new house and refusing to pay for food and bills at the same time (really not sounding like my grandma). We never managed to fix this, and they keep visiting. My grandma still leaves the room when I'm there. 

Last story! My parents are divorced, I keep contact with my bio dad and we are friends, but I consider my stepdad my dad. The divorce was pretty though on me and I don't like to talk about it. But especially I never picked a side and I never will - who fucked whom and why is none of my business and I like to keep it this way. Well one day MIL was feeling specially pissed at me I guess. We were sitting in the garden and she started discussing whom my mom had and affair with and what secretary my bio dad fucked, how my stepdad used to beat his ex-wife and kids (that for a fact I know is a complete lie), how I come from a family of wealthy scum with no morals and she really hopes I won't be such a whore to her son. I know, I know, this is the point someone would expect my DHs shiny spine, but nope, he ignored it and started talking about some other topic. I was quiet and my despise of her rose. 

There is way more JN shit she did and I'll post more of it in the following days.",JUSTNOMIL
"My MIL is so manipulative and her husband helps her to get her way with us.

Backstory So i kind of let my parents in law to get their way with us and now i am paying for it. They are super controlling and manipulative and my husband can't see it. His parents were both emotionally and physically abusive to him growing up and now that he got married they magically want to be a part of their son's life and he would do anything to get approval.

I really dislike them both, my MIL play it super nice and cool in front of me but will call her son to complain about me and he would trust her. They tried to control me in the beginning and i used to smile and move on thinking old people will be old people. They  ll comment about my skin, my hair, my clothes. They ask me not to wear make up and even asked me not to eat bread for breakfast and the list is super long. We both have different cultures but they demand me to respect theirs but never respected mine so now we have very bad relationship. If we tell my MIL in law anything she will get super angry and say she ll never visit us and her husband wouldnt pick the phone either. 2 against 1 (the son).

So recently my MIL manipulated my husband into celebrating her birthday instead of mine and to add the cherry on top of it she asked him to make a salary for her. She has a lot of inheritance worth couple of million dollars, she is rich but doesn't even buy clothes or nothing. So she s manipulating my husband by telling him that she won't give him a dim if so or so and we really need that money. She ll always promise to give us but never does. So i learned that all of this is her manipulation tactics to keep him on her side, plus the fact that she'll be acting all petty for 'not spending her money' ever and not having a life. Somehow i have to pay for her life choices by taking her out and being her friend. 

few days ago my husband told me that his mother will give all her inheritance to some tax government agency not sure what it is and in exchange they will give her money to live off every month. She will be giving couple millions worth lands for few thousand dollars a month!!! crazy !! and if we don't want her to do that we should give her a salary. Note that her husband's retirement alone is 4000 dollars a month but of course no.. she wants me and my husband who work all the time and have no children yet and didnt buy a house or a car to give her a salary otherwise she ll give the land to the government. 

She also said if we want the inheritance we should pay what she got from them and take the lands back which means that we will still end up paying for every penny she took until she dies. 

I'm super mad, i told him she s greedy and manipulative but he thinks that i am being rude to his mother. She's waiting for an answer. She s only 60 yo so i have about 25 years worth of salary to give to her .........",JUSTNOMIL
"This is an old story. This is almost a decade ago when I was young and naive. 
I was living in another state for two months and DH who was just BF at the time, flew to spend Valentine's Day weekend with me and proposed to me very romantically. 

He flew home and told his parents. His dad congratulated him and he got nothing from his mother. Later that day, FIL and DH were discussing the wedding and his mum asked 'who's getting married?' and DH reminded her 'Indiandramaserial and I are' she acted all oblivious. Then she  adds 'it would have been nice to have been asked'

When I flew back, FIL kept saying to me that we should have taken them ring shopping so that they could have put more money into it and bought me a nicer one. 

MIL also threatened to not attend because she wasn't involved in the planning of the wedding. I was asked to apologise to her for any awkwardness by DH and FIL. I did apologise but that was the start of her being off with me. 

We were also asked not to announce on Facebook because they wanted to tell their close relatives such as siblings of parent in-laws. When we finally posted two months later, FIL was upset that he 'didn't have a chance to tell the family and was now being inundated with calls'. DH reminded him that he had two months.

There were also issues with SIL 2 erring all green eyed which made MIL behave worse towards me but that's another post.

"Recently we decided that it was time to add another furry member to our family. My SO lost the dog that was *his* a few years ago and it’s taken some time for him to feel ready. We were all really excited about it, had started looking at local shelters and postings, the usual rigamarole. And then SO told FMIL that we were going to go meet a dog one afternoon after we picked up LO, and she couldn’t have anyone be happy, oh no. 

That afternoon, we walked in and I stepped away for... maybe 30 seconds. I came back and found that she had him cornered in the kitchen and was lecturing him about how he couldn’t afford another dog, how he didn’t have time for a dog, how he hadn’t spent enough time with dog-that-he-lost-recently (total bullshit, but definitely one of those things you question when you’re missing your fur baby), on and on. I could watch him visibly deflate from across the room. As we left, she said he seemed down, did I know what was wrong with him and I bit my tongue so hard it’s amazing I didn’t have blood running down my face. We didn’t go meet the dog.

Later in the week, we had found someone else with a beautiful German Shepherd that needed a home. When she found out we were going to meet him, she went off “aren’t you afraid he’ll hurt LO” “they’re dangerous dogs”. He managed to ignore a little better that time, we met the pupper and now we have newdog! He is beautiful and fits into the family perfectly. FMIL is still at it though. “If he hurts LO I’ll turn into a bad grandma.” Why yes, FMIL, no one else here is at all worried about her safety, thank you. 

Friday we get a text from FMIL. “I asked LO if she wanted to take newdog back.” Record scratch. I was ready to cut a bitch, but it all worked out beautifully. SO responded, “Why would you do that? Please don’t tease her about taking animals away?” She made a dumb excuse and I was still pissed but then he called me laughing when he picked up LO. Apparently she was telling FMIL that she should “take back her kitty because he is a mean kitty” and that “she loves newdog soooo much”. Don’t put ideas into her head if you don’t want to deal with the fallout, lady.",JUSTNOMIL
"Saturday was my cousin's wedding. It was an absolutely gorgeous affair and watching them so in love was really a high light. I spent months looking forward to it, mostly because I'm 35 weeks with a high risk pregnancy so it was really up in the air if I would be able to go. 


The unfortunate part was that NMom, Delusional Grinch, would also be in attendance. It would be the first time we'd seen her since full NC and cease and desist order at Christmas. Thanks to this community, I was pretty well equipped to deal with whatever shenanigans she pulled. D(ear)H was not. I don't think he mentally prepared for seeing her. 


She started her nonsense after the ceremony, she filmed us on our way out and continued to film us as we were all gathered in front of the church for a group photo. I stonewalled like I was made of actual stone. I don't think I actually looked at her once the entire event. It really upset DH, and he told her loudly multiple times to not film him. He got really mad, and I know it's totally justified, but at the time I was a little peeved because it was exactly what she wanted so she could get it on film and go gossip. She didn't stop until I turned around and said enough. But the damage was done. DH wanted to strangle her, and I just wanted to leave so she didn't egg him on anymore and make the day about her and not the couple. 


The drive to the reception was long, so DH and I had a good talk, and I tried to get him in a better mood. We had a great time talking with aunt1, her fiance, cousin and her bf during cocktail hour. Until aunt2, who ignored our pregnancy announcement and is a definite FM, came over to say hi. It wasn't even 5 minutes until she started to pry about DG. I gave her my rehearsed answer (because I knew she would say something): I love you, and want you in our lives but you need to accept that my relationship with DG is over. Everything has been because of her own actions and actions have consequences. If you guessed that it all went over her head and we were met with ""but she's your mooooommm"", have a cookie. Again, fully expected. 


I'm disappointed in her, but I don't blame her. She's fully indoctrinated. Luckily aunt1 and uncle with all of their kids are amazing. The rest of the reception was me ignoring DG and FM, and having a ball of a time and making sure they saw and felt left out. 


Here's where I need some advice. I've come to terms with my witch of a mother. I know why she does what she does and how to deal with it. But DH is having a really hard time. He's been nothing but amazing to my whole family, everyone loves him, and so did DG and FM before their bananary. In general he's well loved. That night, on our way out he told me he hates that my family might think he's an asshole because of what DG does and says. I don't see that happening, they all still love him and show it. He's a very passionate person, and it takes a lot for him to get worked up, but she seems to do it every time. I know I can handle being around her. I've mourned her and our relationship so she really is nothing to me anymore. I don't want to have to never go to a big family function again, but I also don't want to put him through that and I know he wouldn't like me going alone. How do I help him cope with it? Like if he has to be in the same room, or pass her or something? 


In all, it was an amazing wedding and I am soooo happy we went. But it has caused a strain on my DH, and I don't want her to win that way.",JUSTNOMIL
"The Squatter is my JustNo FMIL. All has been reasonably quiet and BEC, but as she is very soon to upgrade from FMIL to MIL, I'm baaa-aaaack. 

Please see post history to fill you in. 

We announced last week to the family that we are getting married in just 10 weeks. My son is out visiting from the UK (big yays!!!) so we decided to get married while he's here. Obviously, I want both my kids at my wedding. We decided to keep it extremely casual, ie, have a big family get together where DS can catch up with all his extended family, and we'll just happen to get married. Sounds simple right? I wouldn't be here if it was.


We explained that we are having a party, with a marriage ceremony thrown in as a kind of afterthought, and it will be super casual. D(ear) FH invites some from his side from interstate, as that's where they all are. 


Saturday morning, FMIL gets on to DFH and asks him when we're sending out invitations (already explained it will be digital, no paper to save costs) and that we have already given everyone a save the date??? She then says she wants to send one to her aunt who lives in further away state. DFH says no, I've invited the people who want to come. 

""BUT FAAAAMMMMIIILLLLY"". She pulls out all the guilt cards ""I only ask for one person, family is important to me, obviously not to you, I want my aunt there to see my oldest son get married, I bet there are plenty coming from OP's side (yes bitch- because we've invited them to catch up with DS who he hasn't seen for 3 fricking years), I don't know what I want to say but I'm not Happy"". 



Well news for you Lady - your happiness is not our priority!!! 


So, she's been silent since Saturday afternoon, but I know another tantrum is coming. I am so proud of DFH as he saw through it straight away. I just hope he can stay strong under pressure! 

She has not offered to help financially with the wedding, nor have we asked her to, or my folks. She is such an entitled cow and I know there is more to come. How do I get through to this woman??????


Anyway the title - hearing all the messages she sent DFH on Saturday - it was like scrolling through this sub on an average day - do all the JustNos go to a special school to learn these guilt tripping techniques?!?!

Edit for clarity: I just wanted to respond to a couple of comments regarding the casual nature. We are doing it this way so we can actually afford to make it a tiny bit bigger. We decided to have a wedding while DS is here, but the fact he is coming was only decided last week, so we literally just  bought  his tickets and started planning last week. Tickets last minute are very expensive. We have hired a really small hall, and pushing capacity limits as it is. We really cannot invite any more people, as we will be over capacity at venue. So ""just one more person "" is actually stretching and we're almost bursting at the seams if the weather is too wet for people to spill outside. DFH suspects she has already invited Aunt just assuming all will be rosy and go her way. Had she checked first we would have explained the situation. Now, it's all our fault for being mean and nasty and not caring about ""faaamily"" as much as she does. Oh and the other gem she came out  with was ""it's very important to me that my Aunt gets to watch my oldest son get married"". I'll send her a DVD.",JUSTNOMIL
"To me my life as always been this way but after years and years of meltdowns , stress  and all sorts of mental issues arising  from the things imposed on me , I started reaching out to others at first just to vent and later on to find out what's acceptable behaviours and what's not.  I'm telling my story inorder to figure out what is normal and what isn't. This is one such instance where I'm confused and need a bit of help to clarify and sort out the mess that is my mind. 


My mother and I have a love hate relationship ever since I was a child. A bit of back story as to why that is .As child I adored her unconditionally but I was never good enough for her ,but not in the same way other people have this problem. No , for her what made me lacking was that , I was never clean enough , never tidy enough , always making a mess ,never sitting still and behaving.  Now looking back I was just being a child and she was just .....being herself. Expecting me to learn things automatically without exploring , learning or being taught, and expecting me to have the same self control/behaviours as an adult. Needless to say with that standard , I've been disappointing her since I was a toddler. I just don't think she was ready to be a  parent  , especially since my father was always constantly away as he works as an engineer on a ship traveling the world for years and years on end. He came back occasionally once every handful of years , would stay for a few weeks which he would spend hanging out with friends mostly and then shipping off again. I don't think she handled that too well and ended up taking it out on herself and me, the closest person who was with her 24/7 all the time.  

 She's obessively germaphobic and OCD. Very much a clean freak but ....her definition of clean is ..it's not universal lets just say . I guess she's also a bit of a horder in a way? Her definition of clean is if things are handled by only her or done only by her way. I remember seeing mountains of empty soap bottles piled up in the back of our house in the kitchen corner , they were as tall as I was at the time . So definitely not a neat freak. Everyone else is never as clean as her in her eyes.  she basically see everyone else in the world as a walking bacteria carrier ............including me. 


Now in my first few years of life I was raised by her and her alone. I remember we had a great big two story house that was just full of rooms I couldn't go into and things I wasn't allowed to touch, things I wasn't allowed to do.  She also didn't really like taking care of the more grueling tasks of a parent , especially ones she felt was dirty (....ya.  Y'all get where I'm going with this. And honestly it's embarrassing for me to admit but since I'm anonymous it's much easier to admit it happened.  )  So I was simultaneously clean all the time , multiple showers a day and being cleaned obessively , but at the same time always filthy because she never undertook the task of potty training me , she just yelled alot. Not to mention the shower and the bathroom was off limits. Huge red zones where if I were to even pass by these two spots from say a meter away she would consider me ""contaminated"" and the yelling and discipline  would start.  According to her they were incredibly dirty and filthy , breeding spot for germs . So she made me use a gigantic plant pot that held water to shower outside where anyone passing by could see me  or just hosed me down from the side while tossing soap at me .  It was always freezing cold . I hated it. 

As for the bathroom I was never allowed to use it unless under her direct supervision. After every use she had a list of steps she would take to 'clean' me. I would have to use the 'rough' bar of soap twice to wash my hands at the sink information of the bathroom , then the clean bar twice . Then move to a new sink further away that was considered the clean sink and go through the same two soap bars steps. Then my clothing would be taken away and put in a bag to be thrown in a corner where depending on her mood she would throw it out or wash it in the washing machine. For any accidents I had , she either just tossed out the things or when I became older , like seven or so ,   I had to wash all the soiled things by hand. When she didn't want to deal with these steps or supervise me she would toss newspapers or plastic bags at me and make me use those to relieve myself. Or she would constantly complain about how all I do was eat and produce waste . At times she would forbid me from using the bathroom at all when she was fed up , obviously this didn't work out too well. Learned to associate that function with fear and dreaded it but it's not like it's something I can stop. It's a fucking biological for fucks sake. 

In the end , in those years in remember I ended up living in absolute filth. I had a mattress to myself in a corner far away corner  from her room and bed  I was never allowed to approach or touch her things much less her sleeping place. I lived and slept on absolute filth and in my own waste as a child and as I grew up because she couldn't be bothered to take care of me or teach me how to deal with bodily functions. This was a shameful part of my life and I am still embarrassed about it all to this day. But after talking to a friend about this I've realized none of it was my fault and that it wasn't  me being some sort of dumb ,useless child who couldn't even do basic function properly like other children.  This blame layed entirety on my mother and her lack of care and those relatives who knew , they all saw what was happening , but considered it as a family issue and never saw it as a problem. Poor mother they all said. ""  You should be a more understanding and considerate child , your mother isn't handling life all too well , it's up to you to take care of her.  Don't be ungrateful , she gave birth to you. She's gone through a lot for you , act responsibly and be a obedient child.  Don't go telling strangers what you feel either , our family's face and reputation is important. "" They all said to me. And I stupidly believed them all the way, right up until three years or so ago when I started going to my school counselor for my stress and anxiety issues. I told her what my anxiety and stress originated from and she was horrified but she also thought I was making up some things or dramatising it. I dont blame her. Apperently my life is stuff full of skeletons in the closet and issues people would go through ever bi year or even once in their life , I go though frequently .  I guess I just have a fucked up family and life. She did help me start working out my issues and to start questiong thing though , and I'm eternally grateful for that. 


Another thing she did was self imposed isolation. We would spend years hiding in our home. As a child I could see all the other children playing in the streets from our balcony and would spend alot of time watching them . I always wanted to join but my mother told me how they were all ruffians , how dirty they all were and that if I ever associated with them she was going to boil me in hot water to clean me. I don't think she was actually going to do it, it was just an empty threat.  She's mad but not gone that far and she does care for me and love me , she just have triggers and episodes where she loses her rashionality at times but even then would never go this far. She would however probably discipline me (yelling , hitting with stick - we Asian so ya I have a personal discipline stick she use to hit me ) , toss out all contaminated things like my clothing , shoes etc and make me go through multiple baths outside with the freezing cold water from the giant clay pot inorder to get me to her standard of clean. We never went out unless it's for my school , necessary things and unavoidable situations. We were always always inside , together. She would never hug me . She wouldn't  touch me if she could avoid it really.  It really fucked me up back then and I only forgave her of all this plus some other things I'm forgetting right now since I'm too busy crying . Maybe I'll make a seperate post for that when I remember . So ya , this and all those and some other shits made me really really hate her for a few years when I lost that unconditional love all children had for their parents. Then eventually as I grew up and we started clashing all my relatives started speaking up for her and defended her.  Eventually I saw that she didn't exactly have a great life either and that I should be more understanding , I forgave her for it all, but ofcourse the feelings stayed. I couldn't just forget all those years and those emotions I felt just because it wasn't a non issue anymore to them. Thus the start of our love hate relationship where we would either interact well and casually with eachother for be in screaming matches. Now that I have a child tho , it's mostly her screaming and insulting . I can't exactly fight with a baby watching and the last thing I want is for her to grow up thinking that behaviour is normal. 

Now fast forward years later and after many many other incidents and episodes with her and her crazy ass . We going to brush through  2011-2015 period too because that is a whole another barrel of fish and an entire novel length of a different kind of event where I was sent off to stay with guardians and some more mess up shit happened . Pretty much the pattern of my life. 


Now at this very moment , I'm still live with her for two months at a time . I spend one month living with my husband and two months with her ( an arrangement she did and basically made my legal situation tricky and binding so this is the only way i can stay together with my kid , it's complicated ) . In these two months she still very much activity practices her self isolation habit and is still very controlling. I can't do anything. I can't cook , clean , touch things or move things ,im not allowed to wash clothing manually or machine wise and definitely not allowed to use/touch the hanging rack because that's where all clean clothing goes and she's convinced I will contaminate it somehow . I'm only allowed to eat what ever she cooks , shower , use my pH and sleep freely. These are the ONLY activities I can do independently. Everything else needs expression permission from her , yes even using the bathroom but I'm 22 now not a child anymore so I have my ways to deal with that part. I'm not allowed out by myself either. Without her or someone she trust accompanying me I'm not allowed to take a single step out the door , hell we arn't even allowed to open the windows of our house to look outside .  She doesn't go on and on about how everyone is a germ carrier anymore, she have gotten milder when it comes to that so at least that's a plus. It's still there but not as intense or crazy as when I was a child living with just her. But she still controls my everymove , every action and every step . (At times the steps are literal , there are place some not allowed to walk or touch and ""red zones "" are still a thing. ) 

I can't buy or spend my money unless its online delivery with her express permission either. Every time I buy something I need her green pass unless we are in public eyes ,she cares about her face and reputation alot , so does my family. Probably why they made sure to train me to keep my mouth shut about everything and never ever to say anything to anyone even if it's a friend or family friend. I was told and trained to always say everything was fine that we were all amazing perfect  people etc etc. They didn't expect me to explode after bottling up everything for years,  I guess they thought I was going to follow every word since I've always had infront of them , never going against a single thing ( all the while I was self destructing inside ) . Shy , meek , obedient and submissve was what I was and that was perfect according to my family.  When it all reached the boiling point and I exploded in teenage rage and anger they all tried to restrict and repress me even more. It lasted two years , two years of independence and then they technically won. Here I am once again going along to their tinly viled orders and marching along to their tune and nodding along to every word they say but I still wonder at times , time alike this when no one's around or times after one of my moms crazy behaviours/ triggers , is this right ? Is this how life's suppose to be. They told me everyone life had hardships and everyone delays with these problems , that I'm a normal person going through normal things like everyone else and that I shouldn't complain and whine like a lil bitch all the time over everyday troubles and that I shouldn't dare to act out again .....but ......


It just.....is this behaviour normal ? It's been driving me absolutely batshit crazy , not that I can express it. If I do all my relatives are poised to drown me in their spit defending my mother and making excuses for her and that will only make me even more pissed off/resentful. I can't show it on my face or go verbal about it  either because she's that type where if u stare into her eyes too long with a look she doesn't like she will attack you and rip you to shreds, verbally not physically - never physically ( there's only been about twice in my entire life so its not really a pattern ) .  She's actually a very mild mannered person in public, nice as can be and a breath of fresh air when she's not triggered or feels challanged by people she consider lower than her ( aka me ).    But when she does , ohhhhh boy. She will follow you and insult you and just attack and attack and attack verbally even when you give up and take all the blame on yourself she will continue hounding you until she is satisfied and all you is grit your teeth and bare through it. Not even my dad is spared form this behaviour but she only does it with family. She's terrified about people finding out this part of her and dad is also highly against This sort of unseemly behaviour being seen by the public. They consider it a lose of face and humiliation if that happens , she never act like this to her friends or strangers or anyone else aside from me and my dad . ( and my sisters too but they don't have to deal with this shit except once or just a year of their entire  life,   because they got adopted and raised by my aunt since they were babies which I'm actually really happy for.  At least she takes care of those two, teaches proper habits and know how to raise them into proper average people. A huge plus for not being crazy and knowing that potty training is a must and that you shouldn't teach/terrify kids that the body production waste is unnatural because it's damn well fucking not.  They never had to live in their own filth and suffer the humiliation I had to go through for those years , that's something would I never wish up on anyone not even the people I utterly hate.  ) 


Right now she's being triggered again. Going nuts about how dirty something is once again . I didn't listen much , I try not to , she never make sense and her arguements are never logical except to herself , all it does is being a massive headache and more stress. Im so stressed I've been out in hospital for fucking phantom stress  pains already I don't need more on my damn  plate thankyou. Currently in my room with my kid hoping to hell she doesn't turn to me once she's done yelling and insulting dad. I mean I already dealt with her episodes in the morning twice today  and is still trying to deal with  keeping my emotions stable from deal with that BS  ( which ofcourse failed considering I'm writing this and is  venting to Reddit to cope but hey , it's helping , I'll take what I can get ) 

Fucking hell dad's gone out . Here comes more yelling and insults I guess. Damn. 

Is emotional abuse an actual thing and do I qualify  ? Idk how much longer I can tolorate this damn Trainwreck . Once I lose it and start yelling back it's going to be 2016 all over again , boy is that going to be like tossing gasoline at a raging fire. Not that I am eager to repeat that year, its different now that I've got a kid to protect ,  everything's different.  If she gets trumatized by this shit or if I accidentally escalate things into physical and she gets in the crossfire . It's not going to be obvious but it's definitely going to fuck her up as she grows , just like it did with me and the last thing I want is her growing up following my footsteps .",JUSTNOMIL
"This weekend, I was going on a Girl Scout overnight, so I arranged for DS to stay with my MIL. My mother was busy.

The morning before she came to pick him up, he was bitten by one of our rats. He was messing with them when they were sleeping. That behavior has been addressed, and is not the issue here. It bled a decent amount, but I stopped it and put on a band aid, and thought that was the end of it.

Boy, was I wrong. 

MIL texts me about an hour after picking up DS:

Hi! Just checking to see if your rats have updated vaccinations. DS just told me why his finger had the band-aid on it. If they don't get vaccinations, and one of the rats bit him,  puncturing the skin, do you think he should be seen by a doctor today? 

Now, this pissed me off for several reasons. Firstly, I checked the wound, deemed it fine, and dealt with it. But she still felt the need to ignore my judgement as a parent and say this to me. Secondly, we just lost our health insurance, so I can't take him to the doctor for every little cut, although I wouldn't even if we had insurance. Obviously, I would take him if something was actually wrong, but this was no big deal. Thirdly, my rats all come from the animal shelter I volunteer at. We do not release any animals without shots and any medication necessary. They also live inside. There is ZERO chance that my PET RATS have any communicable disease. Finally, I am concerned that she has said something to my son like bites can transmit rabies, so I text back:

No, he'll be fine. Please don't mention that to him, he'll get really freaked out about rabies

MIL responds:

Mention what? 

I'm getting pissed and worried now, wondering if she's going to take him to the dr and saddle me with an unnecessary medical bill I can't pay for. I text back:

Just a possibility of getting rabies or anything else from an animal bite. He's a worrier, so it would worry him. But yeah, all the rats are from Local Animal Shelter, so they're fine  

She says:

I'm concerned and would feel better if I knew that they are updated with their shots. I hate rabies too. 

My friends and I have been having an absolute field day with ""I hate rabies."" One of then wants to make shirts. But this is really fucking annoying at the time, as I'm trying to get my scouts loaded up so we can go on our camping trip, and she's pulling this shit on me. So at this point I text DH the screenshot of these texts, and tell him that I will not be engaging her any further, but if she continues to make this an issue I will make my mom go pick up DS. He assures me he will handle it. I say I'm not sure anything needs to be said unless it goes any further. He says he already texted MIL. I ask what he said.

HIS PANSY ASS JUST ASKED IF DS WAS OK. Wow, thanks for handling it. So stellar. Anyway, that's a rant for a different sub. 

So late that night, I call DH and bitch about all of this, and tell him he needs to talk to her about why this was not appropriate. She was ignoring my judgement as a parent and repeatedly questioning me, and I was concerned that she was going to make financial problems because of the way she worded things.

So he goes to his parents' house. Talks to her. Mentions that I didn't like her saying this stuff to me about the rat bite. She says she was just concerned. He lets it drop without addressing the main problems I have.

Y'all. I told him she was going to try to manipulate the situation and make it about her being concerned. What a shock that I was right, and he let her get away with it.

Anyway, so now I'm home, and I'm wondering if I should call and tell her what he didn't say, or just drop it at this point. I really am just at the point where I dislike this woman, and that could very well be coloring my reactions. So please give it to me straight, even if I am overreacting. 

I've posted here a few times about my MIL, so I'm thinking she might need a name. Bitchbot can fill you in on other instances that might help name her.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hello! It's been a while since I posted, bc it's been a while since some shit happened. This one involves baby rabies. 

CCC = Crazy Country C*nt

So a little background; one thing my FMIL is actually gifted with, is knowing when someone in the family is having a baby. She has what they call ""fish dreams"" where she and/or some family member is fishing in the dream and they catch fish. Caught fish = someone is pregnant. And surprisingly, she's never been wrong, it's truly a God-given gift. But I need her to keep her gift away from me. 

Sometime last month, she had her first fish dream. And what's the first thing she does? Call FH and ask if he got me pregnant. The answer is no (obvi), but she INSISTED it was us. We found out a few hours later that it was their cousin B. 

The beginning of this month, she had another fish dream, except this time she text me and asked when my last period was. 🙄 I told her that the question was not appropriate and that I was not pregnant and to stop asking. Sure enough, a few days later, it's another cousin. 

But this passed Monday, she reeeeeeeeally pissed me off. She told FH that she had a specific dream about us being pregnant. She told him that she dreamt we were having a party at JYSIL's house, and FH called for everyone's attention; he then proceeeded to take out a USED pink condom and hold it in the air. Disgusting. 

FH text CCC and told her to stop looking for a baby out of me. He said that he and I were offended that she has so much animosity about us getting married, yet will happily use me as a baby maker to increase the size of HER family. He said it was unacceptable, disgusting, and morally wrong (I know right! FOG almost cleared!). He told her we will have a baby when we're stable and ready, not when we don't even have jobs yet, and are between living spaces; all bc SHE wants another baby. 

HELL! Baby Nephew IL is only 1,play with him. But it seems this family is DYING for a girl in this next generation (bc JYSIL has 2 boys). But idc, I'll have my baby when I have him/her, and she does NOT get an all-access pass. Hell, no one does.

Edit: spelling",JUSTNOMIL
"And she is not happy. At all. Even though the move is wonderful for us and means her son can advance in his field and have more security for his family. 

She and FIL are extremely small-minded and have major crabs in a bucket syndrome and resent DH for earning more money than they did at his age. She resents me for not giving her another grandchild and for “taking [her] son out of church,” as if he is incapable of making his own choices.  

We move in 4 days, and when we went to spend time with her today, she went on and on abut how she “just can’t talk about it.” Meanwhile, when anyone mentioned future holidays, she would snap and say “well it don’t matter cause y’all ain’t gonna be here no way.” 

She is a horrible planner, and has let several birthdays and celebrations pass by without celebrating them because she was “just too busy” and things were just too crazy to get everyone together. They weren’t. But then she uses that to get pity because she berates herself for it. So she mentioned today that she “was gonna try to get everybody together to do something before y’all went away, but it just didn’t work out.” Anyone wanna place bets on this being a total lie?

She’s been angry with us this week because I have had out-of-state family in town and we’ve spent time with them instead of her. The funny thing is, despite living farther away from us than she soon will, they will visit us 3x as often as she will. 

Not looking forward to her daily calls to DH guilting him for “abandoning her” after the move. I’m hoping distance will provide some perspective.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi, folks. I spoke to Count Dramila after months of no contact, and did my very best to grey rock her. I had a good deal of success and learned some interesting things I’d like to unpack.  Sorry this is long. I have a lot of thoughts racing in my fatigued teacher brain, and the kids just had their last day. I have not, however. 

First, a few things about Dramila and my family at large.  I don’t post much, so there is a lot. 

1.  Dramila is difficult but far from the worst JustNo on this thread. She most likely has fleas from her own very JustNo mom.  I have spent 17 years trying to be patient with her. 

2.  My patience ended the night my mother died. TL:DR she made it all about her while I’m trying to hold it together and implied my mom would suffer horribly for an extended period of time because Mom was a big lady. Mom literally died while I was on the phone with her. 

3.  The FOG wasn’t very dense with her because I had always been very aware that she loved stirring up drama. What became crystal clear that night is that I would never, ever be her source of emotional lifeblood again. 

4.  My own parents are complicated and could be very JustNo at times.  The last four years my relationship with my Dad improved significantly as he tried very hard in his own way to make up for Mom’s incredibly difficult nature after she had an aneurism, and even more so when he realized he was all we had after she was gone. Despite Dad’s issues, he has a gift for turning around obnoxious teenage boys, and it greatly appreciate his help with my oldest this 
weekend. 

5.  Dramila refuses to drive due to a very treatable condition she won’t treat so she can be dependent on her children. This isolates her, which further feeds her tendencies. 

Now-back to Dramila. 

Today I needed to call her to thank her for a birthday present. I privately went no contact, only informed my husband and his sis, but not saying thank you is unthinkable due to the way I was raised. I seriously doubt this was trying to get back in my good graces, btw. She is unaware how badly she overstepped because if you talk to her she turns it into drama by calling everyone about how she can’t believe OP is mad at her, blah blah. If the goal is to completely stop feeding her vampiric tendencies, all drama has to be nipped in the bud. 

She gets a sick thrill off of other people’s misfortunes, so it was no surprise that she immediately began informing me of her interpretation of everything she knows about everyone else, whether it’s my business or not.  I made it my goal to not only stop her feeding on me, but to also block her joy from others’ troubles. 

Here are some snippets. 

Dramila-Well, your uncle just had his second eye surgery. He has diabetes, you know and that’s what made our mother go blind...

Me-when was the last time you saw him?

Dramila-It’s been over a year. 

Me-I just went down to visit him. I am happy to report he looks great and has lost a ton of weight because he’s managing the diabetes very well. 

(The Uncle in question is her own brother, who is very weird but very Just Yes and I adore him.  I visit him a lot in another state. She told everyone he was dying. He is not.)

Later...

Dramila-Well, you know nephew is struggling so very much again. He has a new girlfriend so that must be it. 

I asked who the girl was, she told me, and I know her well as she had been my student. 

Me-Oh, great!  I love that kid!  She’s awesome.

Dramila-no, she’s not. She’s terrible. And now everyone but her and her sister know that her mom is dying of stage four cancer. Poor thing. 

(Nephew struggles with mental illness because Dramila and his dad are both difficult, but no. It has to be the girlfriend.  Also, the kid not knowing her mom is dying is totally, yeah. That happened.)

She tried to carry on in this vein with several other acquaintances and each time I denied her what she wanted, which was, “Oh!  That’s awful!  Thank God you’re there to support them.”

She hung up relatively quickly and I was left in peace. 

When normal people talk to one another, we give each other grace by assuming all that is said is said with good intentions. That is the chink in my armor with her. She takes advantage of others assuming her good intentions to make herself look loving, kind and involved in her kids lives. She talks a good game, but she triangulates family members against one another so she gets, you guessed it, more drama. 

Now when I talk to her I assume she’s pumping me for info she can intentionally misinterpret and spread. Then she’ll go suck the life out of someone else.",JUSTNOMIL
"Check my profile for other memorial day weekend antics with Money Badger


So DH sent MB a few pics of the girls from this weekend with his dads family. *Dont ask me why he did it, I think he was trying to make her jealous that FIL &amp; SMIL are getting baby time*

MB told DH that she's going to a Renaissance fair with friends from work. She's dressing up in a full get up. And riding on a helicopter ride over the city after the fair. She text him for over 20 minutes bragging about stuff that her friends were doing with her this weekend.

He wound up with about 9 unread messages in the 20 minute span. He never responded that night and hasn't responded yet.

I have no doubt that she's been using the girls pictures and passing them off for her grandma of the year routine.

DH said he's done trying to be nice to her when it comes to the girls. She doesn't want to see them unless she knows we previously had plans. I can't wait until they're old enough to realize who really cares and who likes playing family when holidays come around.",JUSTNOMIL
"TW: Interpersonal Violence, Verbal Abuse

&amp;#x200B;

My FMIL drives me crazy and I don't know what I should do. Here's some examples of stuff she does: 

\-she'll walk around the house in the early morning (7:30AM) almost creaming at the top of her long, arguing with her FM my FBIL and most of the times making awful remarks of my SO, insulting him and more. She repeats the stunt everyday at 2h30PM during her lunch break; 

\-after almost 6 months of dating her son and almost a year of knowing him and coming over she INSISTS in calling me by the wrong name; 

\-she constantly tells my SO he's worth nothing and that I'll most likely leave him (she says this because he didn't finish highschool and I'm on my way to a second master's);

\-she appropriates my SO's stuff and sometimes even throws them away; 

\-she's constantly thinking of way to extort money from my SO;

\-she'll very nonchalantly straigh up beat my SO in front of me, think slaps, hitting his head, hitting him with a slipper, etc

"   I believe this flair is appropriate if not I apologise Mods, I noticed it was new, but I decided yesterday was a success because me, especially DH didn't let Shady Susan or FIL push us around. This might be a little long because of all the details. The details are important just to show you their mind fuckery. So let us begin, yes this is a mixture of both in-laws but me and DH both feel like  Susan acted way more out of line, so just posting it here.

  So me and DH wake up late we wanted to leave at 5:30am (3 hour 30 min drive plus graduation was moved to start at 8:30 am) we left at 7. So once we have an hour left to drive, it's about 9:30 FIL calls and is a complete dick ""where are y'all at, why aren't y'all here yet, y'all need to hurry TF up"" DH said ""oh thanks for asking about how are drive is "" FIL hung up, then at 10 when we're finally getting about 20 minutes away they made little BIL#3 call us and you can hear shady Susan go ""tell them not to even bother, because they're just gonna miss it."" And DH said ""if mom wants to say some shit tell her to call me herself not make you do it"" and hung up. So we get there and the graduation is nearly over. (Me and DH both think they expected us to go find them and sit with them but that wasn't gonna happen) so once the graduates start to walk off the field  we walk to meet BIL. We finally find him and tell him we'd like to take him and his gf out to eat after all the pictures, but we'll wait for him in the parking lot because we don't want to see in-laws. He agrees, but we turn around and FIL is walking up *eye roll* then proceeded to tell DH "" you're my son and I can talk to you however I want and when you have kids you're going to do the same"" and DH was like ""no because I'm not gonna be talked to like that"" FIL took it as a joke because the man's whole fucking existence is a joke. Then he says ""oh well BIL is leaving to go said vacation right after grabbing his diploma"" then shady Susan walks up. Says absolutely nothing to me or DH. Then asked BIL about his Money lei I made him. ( We live in Texas so homecoming mum's are our thing so I made a ribbon Lei with origami money butterflies and flowers and his name etc)  he told shady Susan I made it and she right in front of us rolled her eyes and said ""of course"". Then Susan and FIL are saying ""well we have to work until one and then at that time we can all take BIL out to eat, and y'all can take all 3 BIls while we work."" Remember how FIL said BIL  was leaving for vacation. Lie #1. We say no because we're leaving their town at 1. And shady Susan said ""of course they have other people to see than us because we're not important because they don't like us"". Then we said we could take all 3 BILs out to eat with us but only if the door to their house was unlocked, so we could drop them off at the house when we needed to leave. They said no the house was locked. So we took BIL and his GF who also graduated. So Susan and FIL are leaving. No hug or anything from FIL just ""they don't wanna spend time with us"" and Susan looks at DH up and down with a CBF, says ""hmph"" hugs him and walks off with FIL and 2 little BILs. Wooooow guys wooooww. DH looked me and said ""did that bitch really just do that"" and I was like yeeeeaaaahh she did. So we go to eat then BIL calls his Susan and asked if one specific door was unlocked and sure enough it was like wooow lie#2. Why even lie??? So we dropped BIL and GF off and leave and go about our business. So proud of DH for standing up for himself and not cracking he said ""why would I want to spend any type of time with them after that"". We both agreed that outting with all of them would've been fucking miserable.",JUSTNOMIL

Fiancé and I had both my very JustYES parents over for tea last night. As we were sitting down having a few wines together, in walks NMIL (two hours later than she’d told us - she was supposed to just “pop in for a coffee” and we were hoping she would have come and gone by the time my parents got there). She is visibly shocked my parents were there.... whoops. Fiancé probably should have told her they were coming, but he wanted to avoid the “*WHY do you have HER parents over for tea but IM not invited,  blah blah blah*” (never mind this tea was pre-planned weeks ago, that my parents live ten minutes away compared to her 1.5 hours, and that being in her presence is soul sucking). Poor fiancé was on edge waiting for her to arrive. 

MIL sits down and proceeds to monologue about herself. Doesn’t ask my parents about my brother, who was recently in a life-threatening car crash, doesn’t ask how any of us have been etc. Everyone is visibly uncomfortable. I can’t even look at her without getting angry. She gets given her wedding invitation and all she says is “Oh yeah, so what colour am I supposed to be wearing?” No thanks, no words of excitement. She then announces that she will be coming up to stay for the week leading up to the wedding, and for several days after. So now on top of organising a wedding, I have to deal with her wanting to hlep for a week. What is supposed to be an exciting time, will now be spent dealing with her bullshit, and I honestly just want to cry. Thank god she isn’t staying with us. 

MIL looks visibly put out that we aren’t THRILLED at this news, and decides she is leaving (yay!). Fiancé walks her out and then mentions GMIL getting out of hospital after life-threatening issues and MIL pretends she knows nothing about it. She definitely knew, she just never bothered to tell fiancé that his grandma was in hospital. Fiancé goes along with it, knowing that she is lying out of her teeth, and tells her goodbye. 

Thanks for reading, I just needed to vent. My MIL is a covert Narc and I dread seeing her. I am seriously dreading the week leading up to our wedding now, too.",JUSTNOMIL
"Preface by saying this was more than a year ago. I should have seen this as the final step before the antics she pulled the day my child was born. I just saw it as a sad attempt to guilt and manipulate me. 

I received this long winded 11 page letter in the mail. 
https://imgur.com/a/jI0oie4
Disturbing because (as she even notes in the letter) she didn’t have my address and no one would give it to her. She got it somehow, clearly. I think maybe somehow from our baby registry or the whitepages online. 

I cut a few pages that went on and on about my brothers (who no longer speak to me because of her) and how upset they were because of how I was treating her. Here’s the thing, the minute she realized I was no longer playing her game, she declared war on me and made my brothers choose between us. Two of them chose her and one refused to play her game. For two years, I continued to call and text them for holidays and got no reply, so I stopped. 

At the time, I didn’t defend myself, I did absolutely nothing. Which is why the post I made to FB which told the truth is such a big deal to me. For 4 years, I have kept it all to myself. 

I didn’t reply to this letter. I shared it with my husband and therapist.",JUSTNOMIL
"Not my first post here, but the first about my own mom. Any advice is appreciated, I'm open to hearing other people's takes.
I'm trying to come to terms with the realization that my mom is turning Justno on me. Or maybe she has been one and because I had worse justno people to deal with, I excused a lot that I shouldn't have.
I would like to post more about her, but part of me still feels guilty about it. I thought I'd open up with this tidbit from shortly before we went NC with each other since im not ready to tell THAT disaster of a story yet. 


Anyways, we are of an old-fashioned culture where it's still a big thing for the man to ask for the fathers blessing before he proposes 
Some see it as too old-fashioned, but I am close to my dad and value his support on things.
My father's blessing is just that, his blessing and support of the union. It's not him ""giving permission,"" because I'm not property, and I'm a grown ass woman who will marry who she wants. I just think it's respectful that my dad is asked for his support of the marriage.

My mother, who I had been getting more and more distant from, felt the need to chime in and say that SHE is expecting to be asked for HER blessing as well.
How about no.

She also feels that she should walk me down the aisle with my dad.
Again, how about no.

For the record, my parents are still married. My mom and I have grown to have a strained relationship at best, and she has proven time and time again that everyone comes before me. Why she thinks either of those things would even be contemplated..?

And culturally, the mother is not asked for her blessing on an engagement. My mother was also only walked down the aisle of her wedding by her father.

Soooo I dunno.. How do I shoot this down permanently?",JUSTNOMIL
"Ffs, Pissy Patricia get it yourself.  

Happy almost-Memorial Day for us Americanos. My family is celebrating it today and PP is over. She initially asked me to get it but my mom volunteered instead.  

A couple minutes went by and I guess she got too impatient. I cannot with her complaining. She is more than capable of getting up and walking 100 ft to the garage to grab it. Ffs.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi everyone! It's me again, this is just an old story, but one of the biggest wake up calls for my FD(ear/amn)H. Also, I'm trying to think of a name for her, because I feel I am going to be posting in the future. I was thinking Whine-o! This is a long story, but it's probably one of the worse ones with FJNMIL  


Anyways, admittedly, I had done something to irritate her. She was supposed to pick me up from work and then we were going to go get FDH. Well, her phone was off and she had never been to where I work - so I left work an hour early via uber to try and catch her before she left the house. She called me thirty minutes after I got home wondering if I was off yet...she showed up an hour early, for some reason. I don't know.  


Skip to dinner, she's making comments about our dishware, about how at home *she* had to do the cooking *and* cleaning by herself (I don't cook). She comments on our lack of nice silverware, on variety of cups (she got us both of these things for Christmas despite us telling her we didn't want to get anything new until we moved). She commented multiple times on my lactose/general dairy intolerance and how she just doesn't know how anyone survives without BUTTER, and how can I eat anything without BUTTER? She had also specifically gone out to the store to buy the butter, because I don't eat dairy and FDH prefers olive oil. Unfortunately, she also bought wine...we purposefully don't keep alcohol when she's over.  


Anyways, FDH has her melt the butter on the side. This isn't the meltdown, I promise you.   


I wait for my soup to cool down, and while I'm waiting, I figure I'll clean the kitchen. I'm very sensitive to heat, so I figured it would take a while. I normally have to wait at least 15 minutes, for example, to drink a cup of tea. She has had about...3/4 of the bottle at this point...roughly 45 minutes after she started drinking.  


I go to clean and she makes an indignant comment about how I must not like her soup. I repeat that it's just too hot for me right now, and I wanted to get ahead on dishes. She goes back to her conversation with FDH, looking back and me glaring every once in a while if I make too much noise washing up.   


Well...she decides she needs more potatoes, and she just HAS to have melted butter with her potatoes. It turns out that I already washing that dish, thinking it was old simple syrup FDH had made the night before. She FREAKS!  


""Why would you just throw that away?! There's more potatoes!!!! I was still eating, are you stupid?!!?! Where did you throw it??? Down the drain?!?!? You can't do that!!!!!""  


I try to apologize and tell her I thought it was simple syrup, FDH is *frozen*. I'm on the verge of a panic attack because my very JNfather was an angry alcoholic and she's in my very small kitchen with me at this point. Like yes, she is old, but my anxiety was just GOING. I start crying.  


She goes, ""I'm just going to have to MELT MORE BUTTER then, what a WASTE, I can't believe you.""  


And to my shame I simply went into our bedroom...our place is very small, so the living room is on the other side of the doors. FDH tried talking to her quietly, something about me not being there when she picked me up came up loudly and she yelled at him and shut down the conversation. He checks on me and I'm crying, so he stays for a bit before going back out there and spending the rest of the night not talking about it and playing bridge with her.  


Every once in a while she would ask me if I was coming out, and I kept saying I didn't feel well and was going to bed. No apology though.  


FDH eventually comes to bed, I'm still an anxious ball, and she starts whispering to herself on the other side of the door finishing the cleaning since I just hid in the bedroom having a panic attack. Some things we heard were ""I can't believe they're engaged"" and ""They can't treat me this way, I bought all that food!""  


Now, due to FDH's lack of reaction and just the general JN of it all, I almost went VVVLC / NC, but FDH did talk to her the next day (he didn't want to try and reason with her while drunk) and told her how absolutely unacceptable that behavior was and that she really needed to apologize. It was a difficult thing for both of us to talk about, because it was the first time he really had to confront just how JN his mom was.   


The end!",JUSTNOMIL
"Just found this thread a few days ago and I felt so overwhelmed at how much a i related to some of these stories. I have been struggling with forgiveness for a very long time, I am 19 y/o and issues with my mom, we will call her BG for Bad Guy. That’s her thing, she always wants to pull the card “yep, I’m always the bad guy and the fucking bitch” or something very similar to those lines! I will try to not get too preachy but a significant amount of detail is required for this story to be true and just. I just want to know if I’m the problem, or if my mom truly is a toxic person in my life.

I grew up in a home of domestic abuse. We didn’t have a lot, lived above poverty line and my parents took good care of me and I got what I needed and often what I wanted as a only child, would later move on to being oldest of 5. My dad hit, punched, choked my mom. They fought in front of me almost every time they fought and I heard and saw all. Although tommy dad was the physically abusive one, they were both extremely verbally abusive to each other. I was always scared of my dad when these fight ensued. He never hit me nor never would harm me in any way. He still has never gotten so upset with me that he is yelling, cussing, etc. he has always been very patient and level headed when I am in trouble, making mistakes, etc. my dad isn’t perfect. He has a temper, he can be an asshole, but he no longer hits my mother and they do now have a somewhat happy marriage despite the past.

From my memories of childhood, most of the good ones I have repressed due to depression and dwelling on the bad times. I have flashbacks and can visually picture the fights and how they would play out in my head. It haunts me every day. Of course I felt bad for my mom, she is a very strong women and worked very hard to fix her relationship with my dad. However, I feel very used. When I was as young as 4, she would make me leave voicemails on my dads phone begging him to come home. She would try to guilt me into going and talking to him and telling me not to be mean and hit her. I was terrified of him getting mad at me even though i knew he would not hurt me, I honestly didn’t want him to come back. Why would I play the messenger in their very real adult fights at age 4? Up until about age 10 I dealt with this behavior and it got increasinly harder for me to see things through my moms eyes. Why didn’t she leave and bring us with her, why did she not even attempt to get help or save us. While my dad was abusive, he would never chase us or not allow us to leave when they fought. 

My dad is NOT a saint. I know this, but due to how my father has brought ME personally up, I find more comfort and support in him than I will ever find in my mom. This is extremely difficult for me to deal with as I feel guilty. Why would I like the man who beat my mother and made my childhood hell more than the woman who raised me?

Fast forward, I blocked out all memories of the fights and abuse until I was about 18. I took my first psychology class and I realized, wow I have been through some really fucked up shit. And I was angry and sad and it all started to make sense. I have a hard time with trust and relationships. I used to lol for guys I could fix. I’m very timid and scared of men. I wanted to know why these horrible things never stuck a cord of “this is ruining my kids childhood” the difference to me between the abuse my father was projecting onto my mother and the effect it had on me was that my mom was pulling me into the fights and using me as bait. This hurts me and I understand her motives but I cannot see why she felt that a 5 year old should have to hear all of these horrible things about their father. She would say things such as “never marry anyone like your father”. I was so sad hearing that, I wanted to love the funny and outgoing guy that was my dad when he wasn’t angry. 

My senior year, my mom started to get sad realized I was moving and hour and a half to go to college. She has always drank, but she drinks every night and when she gets drunk, often tries to call me out on things or is very suspicious of me and is just rude. We started getting into fights. I messed up one night and got drunk at a concert and ptfo in the car on the way home. I scared her and my dad, I stayed at a friends when I told them I was coming home. I messed up
Big time and I felt so bad for the pain I put them through. My dad didn’t talk to me for about a day or two and my mom was constantly asking me to do things because she knew I couldn’t say no. I was in trouble and I wouldn’t want to piss her off. 

That weekend, I pick her and my uncle up from the bars. She gets in and immediately brings it up, before long she is crying and screaming and telling my uncle he has no idea what I put her through. I drop him off and it continues. I try and do anything I can to make her stop. My senior year I was very, severely depressed. My friends had all moved away and I was extremely alone. My mom was the first and only person (besides my sister) that I told. She listened and said everyone gets sad. I asked to go to therapy, she said for what. Like really??? Maybe my extensive childhood trauma? Lol. Anyway never go to therapy and I helped myself out of my depressive slump after losing 8 pounds in a month. While in the car, I bring up how I am depressed and she has no idea who I see when I look in the mirror. She says something along the lines of “wahhhh, you poor fucking baby” I am crying, shaking, and driving. I tell her I want to call my dad and he can pick her up from here. She always acts like “oh yeah call daddy to save the day so he can make me the bad person” she’s always done this. The rest of the summer was absolute hell and we fought always. One night she was drunk and came in my room to tell me to make thank you cards for my grad party. She was stumbling over words and repeating herself and burping and just being drunk. I told her I got it and that she could stop repeating herself. She hates getting called out for being drunk and will always deny, even when hammered. One thing leads to another, I’m balling my eyes out and fighting with her, I walk out to my back porch because she would not leave my room or leave me alone. She locks every door in the house while I am sitting out there crying and tells my siblings not to let me in. Funny story, or maybe not: I come home from college and see she still hasn’t mailed the fucking thank you cards we got into the fight over. One month later after nagging me and locking me out of the house over it to find that she didn’t really care about the cards at all. 

There is a LOT my mom doesn’t know about me. Her brother in law molested me 3 years ago. I have never said anything. I have battled with suicidal thoughts since age 14. I get very good grades and I TRY. So hard. Despite all of the trauma I can’t help reminding myself of, I want to be better than my past. But when I came back from school for the summer last week, I wanted to make sure I was on my best behavior in order to avoid pissing my mom off. I did everything she asked, went to the YMCA with her, went shopping with her, etc. Then the other day we get into a slight argument which ends in her saying “everytime you come home from school you think you can do xyz” she pulls this card in a variety of different forms. My family moved into a new house a month after I started college. I don’t have a room there and I sleep on the couch and share a bathroom and closet with my sister. I don’t mind that I don’t have a room, but it’s weird to see your whole family settled in a place without you. I feel alone when I go home and sometimes left out. When she says things like “this is how WE do things here” it really hurts me. It’s like a slap in the face. She makes me feel like that isn’t my home. After the fight I am in hysterics, so tired of hearing her use that argument, I called my dad crying and he actually listened. I felt bad for calling him to rat her out, but she uses this argument EVERY time I come home because she knows how bad it bothers me. He calls her to tell her to knock the shit off, she calls me and explodes for me calling my dad. She tells me how she doesn’t know how to deal with things and that I make her sad when I do xyz. Ends with her completely switching the story and twisting my word and trying to play victim. She ALWAYS does this and begins with “well you know I could be crying right now too.” I just feel like, I am your child and you are saying things that you know will deliberately hurt me. She knows how to get under her kids skin but she does it to me much more than my other siblings and it hurts a lot, I feel like she has a vengeance against me. She has always acted very jealous. Jealous that I’m going to college, jealous that I got a nice car for my 16th, jealous that I get to go to xyz. And it’s weird. It’s not the type where she is happy for me, but rather grudge-full against me for doing what makes me happy. 

As I now have to spend the whole summer with her, it’s really hard for me to have a relationship with her. She is very stressed, and does not show affection. She does not hug me often, but will hug my siblings. It bothers me that she seems to just not want to have a relationship with me. I’ve been in a relationship for 9 months but she has never talked to me about protection or being safe other than her freaking the fuck out when she found a plan b box and thought it was mine. She handles everything in anger, always. So I need advice on how to handle her this summer while also being happy myself. Thanks so much for reading this book, I have never typed it all out and I’m leaving out a lot but I hope this gets the just.",JUSTNOMIL
"So last week I found out I was pregnant. 1st baby and big news since our parents have always thought we didn’t want children. DH family and mine live 9 hours away, so we don’t see them as much. When we see them is because they visit because it’s hard for us to go because of our jobs. We live in a 1 bedroom apartment so our families visit one at a time. We decided we wanted to tell them in person instead of video chat or texting. My parents are visiting in June and my sweet MIL is visiting in July. The thing is, I don’t trust my mom to keep the secret so my MIL doesn’t find out. She has a story of not caring about her kid’s wishes, last year my SIL got pregnant and my brother specifically requested her not to tell until they publicly announced it after week 12. Needless to say not an hour had passed when everyone already knew, SIL was furious and they hate each other ever since. My question is, any suggestions on what should I do to give each family their chance to know the news? Has anyone had a situation like this, how did y’all handle it? I know my mom is difficult and stubborn but I want to give them the moment mostly for my dad. I can take any advice on how to handle it. I probably made my mom sound nicer than she really is. She’s not.",JUSTNOMIL
"Here I am again. I've deleted the previous posts, bottom line is after a while of minimal contact to my mom and stepfather due to sexual abuse my mother decided to ambush me with a surprise visit, during which she behaved very inappropriately, undressed several times to show me her underwear and tried to get me to drink and walk home with stepfather, I broke off contact completely for about four months. Was fully willing to go through with it, but then my real father had two heart attacks and the only hotel in my hometown was full so I urgently needed a place to sleep and asked her if I could stay for a night because I was afraid to not get a chance to see my father again if I didn't travel immediately. 
I told her I just needed a place to crash. Don't get me from the station, don't make food for me, I'll go immediately to the hospital, come only back to sleep and then go off to the hospital again. She said fine but she wanted to talk to me once when I am there. 

So after sleeping there in the morning we happen to sit in the kitchen despite my plans because I didn't get to eat anything the day before (spent it in the hospital) while stepfather is at work. A little bit of smalltalk, until my mother asks ""so what happened with you and stepfather? I want to know, it is crushing me"".  So I look at her and think about it, and I get angry. I tell her it is not just between me and stepfather, but also the fact that he fingered her on the couch while I sat beside them and how she started moaning and took her bra off. I tell her how disgusted I am and that I wanted to get up and yell at them or throw stuff. I didn't say ""you did this until you came and made me watch"", that would have been too much for me. She tells me she doesn't remember that happening! I was fuming and she was crying and crying, asking me ""why didn't you stop us?"".  I didn't even give her an answer to this, since I knew she was trying to put the blame on me. She gets up and hugs me, but I am a block of ice. For the first time ever she understands and sits back down on her chair. She starts telling me how ""stepfather knew when he touched her in certain places she would..."" and I interrupt her. She tells me how she was abused and raped by her first husband and how she doesn't like being touched on the breasts because of that ""until she was really aroused"". I interrupt her again, telling her that I do not want to know about this. This was the first time I spoke my mind towards her, not caring about her crying and making excuses. 

It was hard, and I was angry, but it felt good to be in control and not let her steamroll me this time. She apologizes, but she also says she is happy he didn't rape me, because otherwise she couldn't have been with him anymore. In other words, what happened to me doesn't seem bad enough for her to warrant leaving. But honestly, she couldn't hurt me anymore. I didn't cry. Her excuses didn't make my flinch this time. I tell her now that we talked about this, here are my rules: You are never going to visit me by surprise anymore. You are not to touch, and especially not kiss me without asking for permission. I will not sit in the bed with you ever again. I do not want to see you naked. 
She nods. Then keeps on telling me about her own abuse, how she always wanted to protect me and why I never came to her for help. Until I tell her: I learned that I had to deal with my own stuff from very early childhood on. You could not care for me nor protect me. You let this happen and have been an active participant. I would never come to you, because you were either drunk or started breaking down right away, so I protected myself as good as I could. Before she can object I ask her ""how come nobody said anything when a 24 year old guy started showing up asking me out for ""dates"" when I was 14 and didn't know better? How come I had to catch him jerking off and break contact myself and you telling me what a nice guy he was? She has no answer and tells me she doesn't remember, then she asks if I was really that young and he really that old, then tells me I never introduced him so she couldn't know (she did talk to him on the door several times, and she knew he had a car, so he was at least 18), running through several excuses, of course, because she knows I am right. She knows I am not willing to let her play the victim card this time, so she plays her final trump card and starts telling me how bad my father (the one in the hospital) allegedly treated her. I listen to it for a few moments, then I tell her ""I have never seen any of this behavior, and my father was always there when I needed help. He was the one driving me in the middle of the night. He was the one buying furniture for my first apartment, after you changed the locks on me (she tried to shift the blame on that one as well by telling me the lock was just broken, but they never told me or made any try to give me keys to the new lock). He was good to me even though I was distant.""  

When she sees that not even that is working she tells me this: ""My life was so bad, I wanted to kill myself. And I wanted to kill you too when you were small."" And this is something I am still thinking about and the thing I originally wanted to talk about. I feel like it is a puzzle piece that fits everything together, but I can't put it in the right place yet. I do not know what to make of this.

But I finally realized, in her twisted mind she will always find a way to lessen her guilt and blame me at least partially. She will conveniently not remember everything that went wrong and always make excuses. I never wanted to have this talk in the first place, but she insisted and it backfired, because now I could finally let her go in my mind. 


I just wanted to talk to somebody about this, so thank you, whoever you are, for reading.

"So my boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years. Everytime we get into a fight or anything he runs to his mom for advice. Now she has an unhealthy attachment to him and always tells him its my fault, he's perfect and her favorite child. Long story short she refers to herself as his best friend. She has ruined events because she needed to the center of attention or make it clear she's the most important person in his life. He always tells me let her have it because she's fragile and we don't have to deal with her much longer. But recently her distaste for me seems like it's causing a riff in out relationship.

"This is a short, easy one. CTHD has ~~said~~ texted two things in the past few days that don't play well together and it's gotten me thinking if this has been a regular modus operandi for her for who knows how long.

"So I’ve been dating the nicest man I’ve ever met for the past year. My boyfriend (28) and I (21) never fight, and whenever we have an issue we talk it out calmly. It’s the easiest relationship I’ve ever had and I never thought it would be this fun and easy to be with someone. 

However. 

He decided to buy a house. My lease on my apartment is up around the same time he’s moving in, so he asked if I would move in with him. Since my name is not on anything, and I can pay him some money and leave if anything happens (breakup?), I thought it would be a cool idea. 

His mom does not think it’s a cool idea. She told him that “Pickles is in school, she’s too young, she can’t live with you. She can’t contribute anything”.  My boyfriend explained that even if I didn’t live with him, his bills would be the same and he was going to get a house anyways. She overall refuses to believe that I will live with him  and went as far to say he will be “supporting me”. 

Well a few days ago we went to the house to start doing some work. My parents came over and brought a ton of gift cards, groceries, and even a pots and pans set for us. They probably spent $1k on presents for us. They also got right to work and helped us paint! It was a great surprise.  

When FMIL called and said she was coming over, my boyfriend let her know that my parents were over as well. This was followed by tears and “I wanted to see YOUR house. There are strangers in YOUR home”. 

Well these strangers are helping your son. They’re also only strangers to her. So come meet them and don’t be weird. The fuck. 

Finally, when she walked in she couldn’t stop saying “BOYFRIEND’S house is so cute. Isn’t his house great?” And almost making an effort to leave me out of it, despite all of the decorating and cleaning I’ve done (with my money too!). 

She’s making me feel young and dumb. Her son is a grown ass man and there is a decent age difference, but I really feel like we get along great and have a good future. Because of that, I don’t want to piss her off or leave us on a bad note, but she needs to lay off. I’m not sure how to handle this. 

How can I tell her that her son is not supporting me and that this isn’t as big of a deal as she thinks it is? I can leave anytime I want in case of a breakup, and I have a ton of friends that live with their boyfriends in apartments. Is it my fault that my boyfriend happens to be older and ready for a house instead of an apartment?",JUSTNOMIL
"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

Long backstory, (not really) short: FH's grandma passed about seventeen years ago. Years later, his grandpa began a relationship/common-law marriage. About two years ago, she asks FFIL to meet her at a half-way point to bring FGFIL for a visit, leaves while they are inside, and then mails his things to FFIL's house. 

Fast forward, FGFIL now lives in a retirement home because FH's family can't afford full time in-home care, and has pretty severe memory problems. The ex is allowed visitation, mostly because FGFIL is happy to see her and to avoid drama, but must get permission from FFIL to remove him from the building. She started trying to replace pictures of FH's family with pictures of her own- but once she realized that all those pictures were disappearing, she printed a picture of the two of them on a giant canvas and hangs it where she knows he'll see it everyday. Recently, she's taken to sending him multiple greeting cards a week, detailing her life and how much she misses him. We've basically all gone NC except for the occasional text to FFIL to ask to take FGFIL out for lunch.

\-----

FH and I are planning a move soon, and won't be able to visit any longer. We're thinking about framing a save the date and an engagement picture, and also doing the same for FBIL and his fiancé. FH is concerned about the ex seeing these and trying to invite herself/guilt us into inviting her, so we're trying to come into the conversation prepared.

Personally, I'm a fan of ""Oh sorry, we're only inviting family to the wedding!"" but any other ideas are welcome! Also, both weddings require a min. 5 hour flight, so her crashing is not of concern (we hope).",JUSTNOMIL
"Where to begin? My MIL is on my absolute last nerve. Her actions and words make me feel like a shitty wife and question my abilities as a mother. She has absolutely no respect for my privacy or my family's privacy. She behaves as if her way is the only correct way/belief, everything else is incorrect. She is a hleper, not a helper in every sense: snooping, rearranging my house, refusing to give my baby back to me, taking over baby's care on the rare days my husband gets baby to himself, making assumptions as to our wants and needs, etc.

I feel like a terrible person complaining and fear I'll come off as ungrateful, because I don't think most of what she does is done to be malicious. But I cannot count the number of times she has driven me to tears and caused arguments with DH &amp; I. Please, please help me understand why she behaves the way she does, provide tips on how to get her to listen to us, and how I (extreme introvert, timid chick here!) can stop being a doormat.

While our families are of similar ethnic backgrounds, I am third generation American and my husband immigrated as a child. So part of me wonders how much this is a cultural difference. Can anyone provide insight into Eastern European mother/son/family relationships? Are moms wayyy over involved or overbearing in their grown son’s lives?

Time for the stories/requests for more specific advice!

* **My anxiety with MIL &amp; baby**: Baby was less than a month old. Baby was best soothed by being walked in a wrap. MIL corners me in the room as I'm trying to position my screaming baby in the carrier, and she GRABS MY NEWBORN and runs off upstairs as baby screams harder. This is my least proud moment, and I hate myself for my lack of reaction, I should have slapped her and fought it. Instead I was focused on preventing baby's legs from getting caught in the wrap as she pulled baby away from me and I locked myself in the bathroom crying until DH kicked my in-laws out of the house. I had what I now understand was an anxiety attack the next time I saw her, and still have really bad anxiety even just thinking about leaving baby in her care. My MIL just announced that she is cutting back her work hours soon and wants to watch baby on her day off, whether I'm working or ""just want to go out"". Of course I interpreted that as ""I'm stopping working and I am taking your child one day every week.” I know that's likely not how she told DH, but that just set my anxiety off again. However, it is a very generous offer for free babysitting and would be a financial benefit to us if I worked an additional day each week. I want baby to have a good relationship with the grandparents, but I cannot fathom having baby in her care on a regular basis. There have been several incidents in the past that make me question the safety of the care they provide. I anticipated this and sent them to a grandparents class prior to baby's birth, but when I asked them how it was afterwards, they dismissed the information as incorrect. Kind of along the lines of well they raised two kids a different way and they turned out just fine. For example, I had to repeatedly tell my MIL not to fill the newborn's bassinet with blankets and not to dress baby in winter clothing while going for a walk in the heat and humidity of a southern summer.
   * How can I work to alleviate my worries and the anxiety that comes with even just the thought of leaving my  baby in her care? How can I ensure that our parenting rules and wishes are followed when we are out of sight?
* **Privacy**:
   * I'll start with the breastfeeding. My family kindly stepped out, closed the curtains and the door to our hospital room after baby's birth, so that DH and I could work with the lactation consultant one-on-one for our first time breastfeeding. MIL barges in and stands at the end of the hospital bed, staring with this creepy smile while I am topless. Many months later, I was very sick while DH was out of town on a work trip, and my in-laws offered to help with baby so I could get some much needed rest (I will NEVER accept this offer of help again, it caused more stress than it was worth...). They repeatedly tried to force open my locked bedroom door while I was pumping (because they insisted on feeding baby) despite the fact that I told them what I was doing. I later discovered that while I was resting, they also rearranged my kitchen and living room. Yet if I nurse baby at their house, I've been asked to leave the dining table and I've been chased after with a kitchen towel to cover up (I never nurse fully exposed anyway, yay for discreet nursing tops).
      * Am I clueless as to proper etiquette with breastfeeding? What I am missing here? When I want privacy, it is denied, but when I don't feel the need for it, I'm forced to.
   * Next up, snooping! We are very lucky to have family that lives nearby and can help us out with pet-sitting. DH and I may not be too social with people, but our home is open to all kinds of animals. My family all lives out of town and DH has a volunteer position that frequently requires travel as well, so I am thankful that my in-laws were willing to help out during those times. But the invasion of privacy has gotten so bad that I have asked if we can hire a local kid to pet-sit next time. For example, my MIL was coming to feed the cat over the weekend. I closed all the upstairs bedroom doors and there is nothing for the cat upstairs, so no need for my MIL to be up there. All the doors were closed when we returned home, but inside, the nursery had been rummaged through and there were items in the guest room in a different place than where we left. This is not the first time there's been evidence that my MIL has gone through closed doors. It's not like I have something I'm trying to hide, but there are things in our home that should still be private and I feel so violated when I discover that someone has been going through my belongings.
      * How the heck do I prevent snooping? They need access to our home sometimes, but they take advantage of it.
   * Back story: while we were searching for a home to purchase, we rented my in-laws old house. They had keys and let themselves in all the time, without warning. Once we purchased our own home, these spontaneous visits ceased, thank goodness, until we were forced to give them a key so they could pet-sit while we were out of town. Slowly, but surely, these unwelcome visits started up again. My MIL scared the crap out of me when she showed up unannounced in the kitchen one time, I screamed and grabbed whatever utensil was closest - she now usually gives a 30 second warning before she drops in now. After an incident that occurred today and spurred this whole post, we are changing out all of our locks tomorrow to keypads that I can frequently change the code on.
   * How the heck do DH &amp; I establish rules within our own home? I know this is something we should have been on top of from the start, that's failure on our part....any suggestions on how to do this now?
* The ""help"": My MIL, I think, wants to feel useful and needed in DH's life. My BIL rarely contacts or associates with their family (ha I can understand why), and DH is the oldest son so I think a lot falls on him. These are the actions that make me feel inadequate, like a failure, like we don't meet their expectations. Overall like shit.
   * The food. My MIL will often put leftovers in our fridge. I think it started as an excuse to come over and see the baby, but it's become a terrible habit now. Her new thing is dropping off groceries for us, things she apparently thinks we should be eating, unasked. But the groceries she keeps dropping off are mostly items that we don't eat. It is very thoughtful of her, but she doesn't listen to us telling her we don't need it. So here I feel like 1) we are the dumping ground for things they don't want but can't throw away, and 2) she thinks I can't cook, buy groceries, or provide food for my family. Many months ago when baby was very little, my MIL and I went on a walk and I tried to talk this out with her. I really do love to cook, I weirdly enjoy grocery shopping, and making a nice dinner at the end of the day is a way for me to take a mental break from mommy duty and enjoy myself. I tried to nicely tell my MIL that she doesn't have to bring food to us. She dismissed me, raised her voice and told me that I did not have time for cooking meals, that she would do it. So I tried the tactic of explaining my love of cooking and told her that when she brings food, she's taking that joy away from me. I was met with the same response. That walk ended in tears and DH had to have the same conversation three more times with her before we saw any change. This is the way every.single.conversation has gone with her when either DH or I confront her. Every time I complain about the excess of food, it makes me feel so ungrateful because I know there are others out there who would very much appreciate being given those things. But I hate that she keeps spending her hard earned money (and time) on things that are going bad before we can eat it.
      * What do I do with all this extra food? How do I get her to finally understand that we don't want or need any of it? Ugh, how do I feel less guilty about all of this?
   * Our home &amp; yard. My MIL has come in uninvited and unannounced while we aren't home to do laundry, vacuum, wash dishes, etc. You name a house chore, she's done it. DH finally admitted that this makes him feel inadequate as well. What standards are they holding us to, that she feels the need to sneak in and clean? She has ruined an entire load of laundry because she threw in a red rag with a load of whites. She has redecorated furniture and every window curtain in the house without permission. She has stored kitchen items in my oven, that have then been ruined when I turned it on not knowing she's put them in there. I don't want my MIL handling my dirty underwear, which she has done. (Side story: after baby's birth, she walked into the hospital room and boasted how she let herself into our house and cleaned up the spot where my water broke. Gross!! And why was she in my house then?). Help is nice when it is true help, but she's caused more harm than good. It constantly makes me feel like I am not good enough for her son or her grandbaby. I feel embarrassed that she thinks my skills as a homemaker are lacking. The other issue is both my MIL and my FIL feel the need to jump in and ""help"" with house projects, again when we aren't home. Only their standards for that are much lower than ours, they hastily and sloppily help. It usually results in more work for us because we then need to redo it. 
      * So how do we enforce this big boundary? What can I do to feel better about myself when my MIL ""helps"" in ways that reflect poorly on my abilities? Prior advice given says to just let it go, but how the heck can I do that? I’m afraid this anger is going to simmer and all these emotions will spill out in a not very nice manner one day.

Thanks for reading! I guess I'm looking for some sympathetic ears, maybe someone out there who has experienced a similar relationship and can share advice on how to maturely, but firmly handle things. Anything to help me keep my happiness and sanity! I am so worried that my child will have negative perceptions or a poor relationship with my in-laws because of my struggles with them, and I don't want that for them. Are there any ideas on how to make this topic easier to discuss with DH? He’s often trying to be the neutral party, and then I get upset when he doesn’t defend me. But I also know sometimes I overreact to some of the things I find my MIL has done. I have always kind of felt he should handle his parents and I'll handle mine, but he has a hard time setting limits with his parents; no one ever tells my MIL no or confronts her (and I've been shot down the few times I've tried). My family is by no means perfect either, but I have no trouble standing up to them and my mom, so far, has been respectful and followed our requests when it comes to childcare and our home.",JUSTNOMIL
"First off, wtf. How is it that MIL, ss-dependant, almost chain-smoking, stubborn sailor mouth MIL, says what we need in order to toughen up? 

“When I was growing up in Brooklyn...” 

What, 100 years ago? Get with the times you racist MIL. Because we had drug dealing neighbors and loud parties at the apartments when we lived there doesn’t mean we needed that rowdy experience, especially with a kid that was less than a year old. 

“Oh, I’m gonna have my daughter try these drugs, with me, so she can have that experience.”  

This pisses me off, so much. Like literately slit your throat pissed-off. How’s that for toughening up? 

We pay for you to go and do shit, and you still have the gall to bring up your “horrible habit.”  You don’t even call it an addiction. And you said you would quit when our kid was born. You still haven’t. “Oh, I’ll drop it one of these days.”

The only reason I haven’t pushed you to the streets is your daughter. 

I got a mechanic to fix your fucked up truck, you aren’t happy with that. You have a roof over your head, even if we are living with my parents, you aren’t happy with that. 

Like what the hell do you want? I don’t care that you are still upset that your husband died almost 10 years ago now, you can’t take your frustrations out on my wife, and I better not catch you doing that to my son. 


And you are still hanging with drug dealers down the street. I mean the fuck. You came back  stoned and probably drunk off your ass. 

Okay, I get it. You were out, you wanted to feel alive, but could you have given anyone some noticed as to your activities? Hell, you even have your daughter shit when she was just trying to make sure you were safe. 

And now, you’re hanging me money behind the wall in the back of the house like it’s some sort of drug deal. Wtf. No one else is even here right now. Who the hell are you hiding from?

These above reasons and many more are why I don’t trust you with my son. 

Could you just be happy for once and not blow smoke, literately and figuratively, in our faces?

That or find somewhere else to live because apparently your daughter is at her breaking point too. 

I mean.  Fuck man. What the fuck makes you happy?",JUSTNOMIL
"Firstly, can I just say I’m SO grateful for this page/group....I had absolutely no idea that such thing existed where you can openly rant about evil MIL’s and was sitting there googling the Jocasta complex and came across this group.

I don’t really know where to start, for me this is more of a reflection of what’s happened and how to deal with the MIL and IL’s moving forward. We will now be moving nearly 1.5 hours away from the IL’s.... thank god. 

Basically, my MIL has been bullying me ever since I’ve been married, it has now been only 8 months. She is absolutely obsessed with DH as he’s her eldest and first child. I moved closer to my DH hometown and haven’t had any of my own family or friends nearby I feel that she has taken advantage of this with her bullying and manipulating tactics. So from day one, she has interfered in everything, she’s told me that it’s my job to make sure her son (DH) is fed, his washing is done and house is clean too. Looking back, I feel that I should have been stronger and stood up to her but to be honest, I was a bit scared and didn’t want to get in her bad books. Also, we have our own house and as soon as she left everything will be normal again, so I didn’t make a big deal of it. Every time I tried to speak to DH, he just said his mum is sarcastic and to ignore it and not take her seriously. 

At the start of our marriage I was nearly 5 months pregnant, we now have a baby who is 3 months old, during the pregnancy the MIL would keep telling me that it’s her baby, and would constantly ask me if I’ve eaten and fed her baby. I found it really weird but as usual ignored it. 

Just to give you guys a bit of a background MIL and FIL have custody over their 2 other grandchildren, my DH’s brother and now sis-in-law had them at the age of 15, then second one at 17 and at the time were not serious about life, parent-hood etc. They are however now 23 and perfectly capable of looking after their own children, they have a 2 year old who is happy and healthy and lives with them. However for their other / 2 children, MIL has had an SGO (special guardianship order) in place since they were a few months old and this was approved by courts. MIL, still has this in place, she controls and restricts how much contact they have with their mum. She only allows them to have contact once a month, sometimes only a phone call. I find this very weird and sadistic? I don’t get this woman, how can you be a mother have 6 children of your own and be cruel enough to see your own grandchildren and daughter-in-law suffer without her 2 children. Surely, as a mother you would understand the unconditional love that those poor children are living without, the love you can’t and don’t give them. It makes me so angry just thinking about it. 

Anyway back to my story, so the evil MIL had been trying to come to all my post natal checks etc, and I made it clear to DH that she needs to back off. He had words with her but she didn’t stop. She would do anything to get closer to me and come across helpful but little did I know about her hidden agenda. She would cook dinner etc very often, and I would think she’s lovely and then she would use that as an opportunity to find out more about my birth date etc. Ive been living around 2 hours away from my family and friends, therefore didn’t have anyone of my own people around me and didn’t really go out much to make friends. We were busy decorating our new house, designing nursery and then I was working full time too. At one point during my pregnancy, I became so reliant on her that I was staying with the IL’s, I really don’t know how, but she asked and asked and made it out like she wanted to look after me and help me as a mother figure and me and DH just started to live with them. Also, this made DH very happy to see I was getting along with his family.

During my stay there she would expect me to cook and feed DH, put his food in a plate and in front of his face, wait for him to eat and then put his dishes away for him too.... I was 8 months pregnant at this point. I didn’t say anything, or react. I kept it in and then had a word with husband and we tried to leave from their house, she wouldn’t let us leave but in the end we managed to get away. My due date was approaching and she was extremely excited, I don’t know why I felt sick being around her, honestly it was the most horrible feeling ever. I decided to then reach out to my sis-in-law whose had her 2 kids taken from her to seek some advice and found out the following:

- MIL did the exact same to her - wanted her to be a slave to her now husband and overly cater to him 
- MIL was obsessed with the kids before they were born
- sis-in-law was forced to stay with IL’s during pregnancy
- MIL was desperate to be involved in pregnancy, in any way, shape or form
- MIL tried her utmost best to be their for delivery for the 2 children 
- sis-in-law didn’t get to do skin to skin with her children as MIL came and took them from her as soon as they were born and she did the skin to skin contact 
- MIL worked with social services behind the sis-in-laws back and got the kids taken off from her 
- MIL has had an hysterectomy so she can’t have any more kids of her own 

Sis-In-law has also told me about the history of the family and how the MIL who is completely obsessed with my DH has said she will be ensuring she raises my DH’s kids. I mean, does MIL not understand the purpose of his wife etc? Or does she think he just married to acquire a slave? I just don’t get any of this, I find it extremely bizarre, strange and WEIRD AF. I mean being around the family it’s very clear that my DH is like the golden child, the one that’s seen as perfect in everyone’s eyes especially the MIL but this is some next level of weirdness and obsessive behaviour. 

Now my due date is approaching and she’s absolutely dyinggg to be in the room whilst I give birth. I made it crystal clear to DH that I don’t want her anywhere near me whilst in labour, and she can come afterwards to see the baby but 100% not be in the room and if she tries it I will leave the town to give birth. We then had to lie to her and tell her that my pregnancy is high-risk and that I’m not allowed more than 1 person in the room, she asked several questions but DH sorted it with her. I did end up having a c-section in the end. 

Once my little one was born, she came rushing to the hospital, with clothes, blankets, soup and drinks for me, pads, anything I needed. My sister came to see me and she kept hinting to her that visiting time is running out, I only found this out later and found it extremely rude.... makes me so angry when I think about it. Who is she to dictate how long my family see me for? When she’s the one whose unwanted and has had a hidden agenda.

So the evil old witch came to live with us for 2 weeks after my c-section to apparently support me, however during those 2 weeks when I couldn’t really get up and around and do much all she was interested in was my baby. She would eat and make mess in the kitchen, leave her dishes for me and DH to clean whilst she was all over my daughter. I didn’t even feel like I gave birth or gained anything after those 9 months and that surgery. During the first 1/2 months of my baby girls life I felt like she wasn’t mine, I mean isn’t it bad enough that us women can potentially go through post-natal depression? Do we need this extra stress to go through? Do we need an extra person to make us hate the whole process? Arghhh makes me so angry when I think about it. I can’t even deal......

Anyway, she finally left and it was the best day of my life.... she then continued to interfere in our marriage and my parenting so we kept the contact very minimal....she didn’t get the hint and it resulted in me and DH constantly arguing over it. She would tell my little one to call her ‘mama’ and all sorts. She would make comments in front of my face like ‘your not a mummy’s girl your daddy’s girl’ and ‘you don’t want to go to your mummy do you, you only like your daddy’ right in front of my face! She told me I was fat when I’ve always been a size 6/8 my whole life. She told me that the weight gain during pregnancy wasn’t the baby it was just me because I’m fat. I find it so disrespectful and rude considering she’s a woman herself. It really does make me laugh because their whole family is actually overweight including DH who has only started eating clean because of me. Her other daughters are above their bmi and so is she. Her arms are the size of my thighs and bum cheeks together LOL. 

So after all the bullying mentioned above and so many other things, I decided enough is enough and told DH that I want to leave the area..... we had only just purchased our house 7 months ago and designed it to our choice, it’s a new build and we watched it come together. We furnished it and it was perfect. Anyway regardless of this I think i let so many things slide and then eventually just had enough of it all, I couldn’t handle it. He wasn’t at first agreeing to moving but I took the initiative to find somewhere away from here and start renting. He’s now finally agreed and we will be officially moving in the next 2/3 days and be getting tenants in this house. Hopefully we will make enough to cover the mortgage and rent for the new place. I haven’t spoken to MIL or any of my IL’s for nearly a month and the thought of ever seeing her makes me sick. He’s spoken about going there for dinner but I don’t want to.... not sure what to do really. 

I’m just so glad, so relived to be moving and also to not completely let this affect me and stop me being a good mother to my little one. The MIL could have so easily affected me and made me hate motherhood, although she made me hate the whole process of marriage, childbirth etc, I do love my little one to the moon and back and I’m so thankful she is happy and healthy. My DH I feel has always been in the middle but he is extremely supportive with the little one and around the house. He cleans and helps with cooking as much as he can and really is a good dad to our baby. 

I just wanted to rant really and get peoples thoughts on this situation, I mean is it ok to never speak to her again? How do I deal with it? I will be going for relationship counselling with DH and also individual counselling too because of this whole situation but I don’t know how I’m supposed to react or respond? I mean that will always be his mum and she’s still in her late 40’s and won’t be dying anytime soon either. Do I just ignore her for the rest of my life and pretend she doesn’t exist or do I go to hers dinner and make sarcastic remarks in response to what she says? 

Thanks for listening, and I hope and pray those of you currently dealing with evil MIL’s get some peace, happiness in your lives and god gives you the strength and ability to deal with these desperate b**ches. I am a strong believer of karma and they will get what’s coming to them xxxx",JUSTNOMIL
"So my mom and I had a God awful relationship till about a year and a half ago. My entire childhood I hated her. A week before I turned 18 she kicked me out cause ""you wanted to live with him (my now fiance) now you can get all your shit out by Saturday""

Over the next year and a half it was nothing but ""this is what you should be doing, you can't do that, you are doing it wrong"" which surmised itself with Ina weird bout of honesty I asked her if she could go back and make a few decisions again would she change them? (both my siblings were given up for adoption I was not..) she admitted she would give me up for adoption if she could. After I had spent every day for a week at her place helping her get off of a drug. (she is now using again but oh well)

A few weeks later I cut off contact. For 9 months. Never got an apology never got anything. I broke my arm and my dad guilted me while I was on pain meds to talk to her.

We started talking a bit. Seeing each other about once a month. Maybe less. Then she got sick. Since she got sick we have spent a shit ton of time together. Then I got engaged. Even more time together because ""we want to pay for your wedding""

Now the thing is.... I feel like an ungrateful brat. I've gotten in a few situations she promised to help me out of, just to pull the ""oh well you aren't trying that hard to get out of it yourself so I won't be helping you""

She has done nothing but complain about the cost of many things for this wedding. I almost am.... Not looking forward to my wedding because of this. But any time I bring it up she bitches at me.

I know I never should have taken the offer of help from her. I know this. But now I'm getting married at the end of this year and it's to laye to back out.

She keeps getting pissed at me over small shit and ""Not being up for company"" aka I can't even come to her place and work on wedding things. (demanded if I wanted to work on any part of wedding at her place that part could never enter my home. I live with other people who have roaches. Yes I know eww. We deal with it. But she's scared of getting them so I deal)

So I can't even work on wedding things right now and with stuff coming close I'm starting to worry this was a huge mistake. I'm not even sure what I'm asking for here or if I'm just venting....",JUSTNOMIL
"Mobile so shit format, blah blah. Long time lurker, first time poster. 

Background: My soon to be JNMIL has always had a hard grip on my partner’s life because she turned out the only one of her siblings who didn’t get into drugs heavily or abandon her mother. Until we were together, my partner was living at home basically her mother’s slave. Soon after they moved in with me and my mom (we’re both young, and my mom is *slightly* less awful) and they changed completely and basically bloomed like a flower. 

Lately we’ve been staying at our friend’s house. They’re leaving for their honeymoon for 3 weeks, we’re house/dog watching, and we’ve been getting the feel of how things work while we’re here so things don’t go to shit while they’re gone. My partner has their location services (Find My Friends) on for their mother and their mother has texted and called them every day for the past 5 days wondering why we’re here and saying she’s worried, saying that my partner needs to move back home right this second. We assures her we’re at a friend’s house and everything’s fine, they’re leaving soon for their honeymoon, it’s not a big deal. It’s not.

Yesterday, out of NOWHERE, she shows up here. We’re all outside because it’s beautiful and not raining for once and we’re making plans for the rest of the night, when all of a sudden I see JNMIL drive by. I said “Honey, I think your mother just drove by.” And surely enough, gets a call from their mother asking what they’re doing. 

She did not ask. She did not text or call us ahead of time. She simply showed up to a stranger’s house without asking. 

Our friend is freaking out. She knows how weird my partner’s mother is and can be, and she just showed up to her house unannounced. Now she knows where our friend lives. Our friend asked my partner gently to turn their location services off for their mother, because she’s uncomfortable with the fact that their mother showed up out of nowhere. And they won’t, they mentioned turning it off and JNMIL said that she’d come find us if we did. (I don’t care, what is she gonna do?) They mentioned that it was inappropriate that she showed up announced, and she said “I’m your mother and I was worried, I can do what I want” I can assure you there’s no reason to worry, and poor fella doesn’t understand what could’ve happened if our friend’s husband was home, he doesn’t take uninvited strangers on his property very well. Luckily he decided to go fishing. 

Anyways, all their mother does is use and abuse and beg for money. I’ve been trying to encourage cutting her out of our lives so we can continue to grow. She’s a very large part of what’s holding us back from moving on with our lives, apart from all the damage she’s done over the years. 

For me, this crossed a huge line. We even just got an apartment and we’re scared to tell her because of something like this happening. Not to mention she’s been screaming “move back home” in our faces for two years. I’m so fed up with all of the shenanigans their mother puts us through. Did she go too far this time or am I overreacting??",JUSTNOMIL

Background: My DH's grandmother lives with us, she's 92yo. I am a SAHM to my 3yo DS, 10yo DD, and caregiver to her. She's been living with us for the last almost 6 years. She adopted my DH and BIL when his mom (GMIL's DD) died when he was 11.  She has been trying to break us up for the last 19 years.  I'm 35 he's 36, we've been together since high school. She likes the devide and conquer strategy even if it hasnt worked once yet. She trys to play DH and I against each other, enough so that she's lied about things that didn't happen.

On to today. I dont get to spend much time with my friends.  I got to spend last Saturday with them and then again today, but I hadn't spent time with them since January. When we get together we play board games.  Today we got together at 3 and we ended up playing a game that we didnt expect to take more than 1.5 hours, it took 5.  In that time I was texting my DH to see how things were at home, let him know that GMIL needed her meds and which ones, and to apologize for taking so long.  He didnt pass any of this along to her, but I dont blame him.  Well, while I was gone she implied to my DD that I don't care about my family and that she needed to leave $$ for her and DS so they can take care of themselves because I don't care enough to take care of them. DD told DH about this, but he didn't confront her right away, he wanted me to come home and hear about it first.  

When I got home (about 1.5 hours ago) I told her I was home and she laid into me.  That it was a disgrace how I treat my family that I was out for too long and that I dont care about them. That she was worried sick and I don't communicate with my DH to tell him I was ok, etc.  I told her I did text him and that if he didnt tell her it wasnt my fault. She got even madder about this and told me I need to clean my house.  I'm sorry, its a little cluttered, but its clean. Because it isn't magazine cover clean it isn't clean enough for her.

Now DH will get annoyed with her constant questions about the same thing and will grey rock her and not give her any information.  Its just yep and nope that will come from him.  So when she was asking him questions about me that's all he gave her, she assumed that I hadn't been talking to him while I was gone.  This whole thing pissed me off.  Now I can't sleep and in getting a headache.  I dont think ive ever been so mad at her before, I came so close to calling her a bitch to her face. 

I'm open to any advise or criticism if you have any.  Thanks for hearing me out.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hey everybody, first time poster on reddit. Hope that I follow all the rules, I've been lurking for a while. So I'm at a place where I can confidently say that I have a JNmom. In general we handle this issue by living a few hours away, and interacting in small doses. She has moments where she redeems herself, no one is totally black and white, I think that goes without saying. But hooo boy. This weekend.  What I am looking for is some pointers on how to handle love bombs. 

Ok, so the high level summary is that we were going to buy a car from my younger sister (WTAF were we thinking).  My indecisive husband decided not to at the eleventh hour, pissed off younger sister - tbh she has a right to be pissed. Due to unhealthy family dynamics I am triangulated into the sister/husband conversation (THIS IS NOT MY THING!!! WHY????), and then JNmom gets involved. She takes sister's phone and sends texts to me and my husband saying ""This is mom. This conversation is over for tonight"". 

So, whatever we don't end up buying the car and there is like CLEARLY some shit talking going on and people pissed off. So then I start getting texts from mom, totally ignoring any other happenings, and  each one ending with ""Love you!"" ""Drive safe honey, love you!"" Like seriously five in a row. Of course I love my mother, but she is just taking my temperature to see what I will do. So, current tactic is I have been grey rocking and changing the subject. The last one I just didn't respond to. I kind of want to call the behavior out bur frankly I'm worn out from the drama, and it will be all ""I can't tell you that I looooooooveeee yoouuuu???"" and like a whole thing. Any thoughts?",JUSTNOMIL
"Sorry, this is long. CW: suicide, abuse, overdose, mental health..

&amp;#x200B;

Hey all. Long time lurker, first-time poster. I am having the worst week of my life, and this sub has always been something I read to give me perspective on my own life.On Monday, I couldn't get in touch with my BF (soon to be FDH). After not hearing from him all day, I let myself in with my key since I saw his car in the driveway and wondered if maybe he had slept in. Instead, I found him sitting on his couch, dead. He had shot himself in the head. The last time we spoke was Sunday night, and he revealed that his JNMom had called him and upset him after he talked to her about buying a house for him and I. He acted very strangely after the call, and then never responded to my texts after that. Apparently, he had died around 2 am Monday morning.

&amp;#x200B;

I went into complete shock and begged the police to pass my number onto his JNMom (who I had no idea was JN at the time) and she had zero emotions and was even laughing on the phone. She said she considered me ""basically her DIL"" and that she would be there for me. That night, I was unable to cope and I accidentally overdosed on vodka and my prescription Xanax. It was my duty to secure his apartment after the police left, and since there were security issues in the building, I decided to grab his wallet, car keys, laptop and important documents for safe-keeping to give to his JNMom when she got in town. I put them in a bag in my car and left it there in the hidden compartment of my trunk. However, I was so sick from shock and overdosing, that I had slipped in my shower and hit my head pretty bad and probably had a concussion. 

&amp;#x200B;

I took an Uber to the hospital and was admitted to an inpatient facility as I had severe mental trauma from what I witnessed and was under watch since I hit my head so hard. I was pretty much unresponsive the first day or so and refused to eat or take care of myself and mostly cried in bed.JNMIL came into town the very next day after the body was found. Never once called me or visited me in the hospital, even though my JustYesMom gave her all the phone numbers, addresses and visiting info and pleaded for her to check in on her only daughter. My JustYesMom was my advocate the whole time and called the JNMIL on the phone to try and help out. My mom was concerned because the JNMIL had nothing nice to say about my SO, and called him a ""degenerate alcoholic"" (not true). Even my own mother was appalled by this and jumped to my SO's defense and said some very lovely things about him which angered the JNMIL and she hung up. 

&amp;#x200B;

She left harassing voicemails on my JustYesMom's phone threatening to call the police on me. My JustYesMom lives several states away and has never met this woman and was only trying to contact her in hopes that someone could be there for me in the hospital as my JustYesMom cannot leave to be here because my Dad has advanced cancer and is his primary caretaker on top of having to run a business full time (JustYesMom is a total BAMF). My JustYesMom was sick over the fact that she couldn't come to visit me and bring me things I needed and have someone there to advocate for me to make sure I was going to be okay, but called me almost every hour, was on the phone advocating for me with the doctors and took over my social media accounts to keep my friends updated. JNMIL was the opposite. She angrily called JustYesMom screaming that she needed his belonging ASAP and that I checked myself into a mental hospital because I was scared because I robbed her dead son, even though I sent her a text message letting her know what I did and why and she agreed it was a good idea and thanked me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I called her immediately and she did nothing but scream at me, calling me a thief because the apartment had actually been robbed after I checked into the hospital and she had gotten there, which I warned her would happen in that apartment building (someone took the tv and PlayStation and possibly a work phone) She was angrier that I was in the hospital because she wanted me to give her free rides all over town because she refused to pay for an Uber. She was angry because she couldn't sell the TV now that it was missing. She also screamed at me asking me where his guitar was...which he had given me months ago and was in my closet. She demanded it back, even though it was a gift to me as I'm a musician and he had no interest in playing anymore and loved going to see me play at shows. 

&amp;#x200B;

She never once asked if I was okay and told me that I was weak minded and needed to get over it and she was a stronger person than I am. (I told this to my doctors and they rolled their eyes)Not even thirty minutes after I'm discharged out of the hospital after FOUR excruciating days begging to be let out and totally zombified by mass amounts of anti-anxiety pills that might as well have been horse tranquilizers, my SO's neighbor who was a friend of his and exchanged numbers with me the night of the incident, texted me to let me know that the JNMIL was outside screaming and calling my SO her ""bastard piece of shit son"" to the property manager and harassing all the neighbors and yelling and banging on their doors for making any slight noise.After getting an Uber home and taking my first real shower in a week and cleaning up, I shoot her a text and let her know I'm out and need to get my bearings and clean up a little before I come over because I've had a really traumatizing week. 

&amp;#x200B;

I immediately get a phone call from the local police asking about my whereabouts and that JNMIL was claiming that I had stolen his items and was refusing to return them and was on the run. I calmly explained the situation to the officer who was very understanding and I let him know I had been texting her asking her when she would like to meet to return the items, but that I was coming out of sedation and needed a minute to put on some clean clothes after wearing my dead SO's pajamas for four days straight. I arrive at the apartment parking lot and explained calmly to the officer what was going on and that I had been in the hospital all week and she had been harassing me. He walked me up, carrying the guitar and a bag of the things I had secured. She opens the door and doesn't say hello but glares and snarls at me. I calmly asked her why she was being so insensitive to me and not consulting me on our agreement instead of calling the police on me. She called me a thief and a liar and accused me of robbing the house even though I had everything brought back to her that I said I would keep safe until she got here.

&amp;#x200B;

 His phone was missing due to being impounded by the police when they took the body and she told the officer that I stole it. I asked calmly if I could please come inside and just have some of his t-shirts (I planned to make a memorial quilt out of them) and she told ""If you return all the items you stole, I might consider giving you one. But honestly, I'd rather give them to the Goodwill than to a mentally ill liar."" I then told her that my SO would not appreciate me being treated this way, as he always stuck up for me and refused to ever say one harsh word to me (he was a very soft-spoken and kind person). She screamed, ""DON'T YOU DARE SPEAK FOR MY DEAD SON! HOW DARE YOU!""

&amp;#x200B;

I collapsed. I just started sobbing and clutching his guitar case I had carried up. I just laid there on the ground sobbing my eyes out and the only person who did anything to help me was the police officer who helped me get to my feet and went over some breathing exercises with me. She let me keep the guitar because she said she couldn't get enough money for it anyway, and then started grilling me about what banks he used and what kind of money she was expecting to get from this and how much his car was worth. The police officer had the shiny spine for me and told her that was enough and said he wanted to escort me away from the situation as it was becoming hostile. He walked me to my car and loaded the guitar in the trunk and said not to worry, that I wasn't in any trouble and I did the right thing.I just sat there in my car for a long time and sobbed until I couldn't feel anything. I lost the love of my life, and had to see and touch his dead body...and this woman had no remorse or empathy for me. I was just trash to her.  She had told me she was relieved we hadn't gotten married yet because that gave her the power of next of kin. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't want anything from him. All I want is to have my beloved SO back, he was my world. I had managed to grab a few things of no value the night I found him which I put into a box. It's all I have to remember him by. A lighter, his comb, a t-shirt that smells like him...I know it's stupid but it was such a sudden loss I'm having a hard time processing.I understand that people grieve in different ways, and maybe some people channel the anger they feel onto other people. But, there's just not something right about this woman. My JustYesMom told me that if it was the reversed situation she would have found a way to be there for my SO and take care of his needs because it's the people that are living and hurting that take precedence. I swear my JustYesMom is a literal angel. 

&amp;#x200B;

The night he died, we were texting and he told me his mother had really upset him over the phone (she had a past history of verbally and mentally abusing him as a child) after he told his mother he wanted to marry me and was looking at buying us a house. He cryptically said, ""My mother is going to outlive me"". And then he stopped texting not long after that. I feel so suspicious that she drove him to do it. She has no remorse, refuses to say anything nice about my SO, and has been harassing both myself and my JustYesMom. I blocked her phone number, but I'm afraid she may come after me legally somehow. 

&amp;#x200B;

All I did was offer her my love and support and do what was right for my SO, and I am repaid with unrelenting hatred in one of the darkest times of my life. I feel so bad for my SO, he must have had to deal with her more than he let on. I don't know what to do right now other than take care of myself and try to get my life back together. A week ago I was looking for a wedding dress and making appointments to look at houses...and now I'm just a broken woman with a messy house and Taco Bell stained pajamas trying to figure out what just happened. I'm thankful at least my JYMom has been my guardian angel through all of this.",JUSTNOMIL
"As stated in my last post, I got my nips pierced. I’m up here with my best friend and I’m on vacation, free to do whatever (dad told me to go all out and make the most of it). Mom is not happy about my piercings, and she’s even more unhappy because I’m considering getting my tongue pierced. I realize it’s unnecessary and probably a waste of money, but I think it would look cute on me. My current piercings have made me feel a lot more comfortable with my body to the point of gassing myself up in the mirror when I’m naked. I didn’t do that before. I’m also losing fat pretty quickly so each day I see my body, I just get happier and happier. The scale is fluctuating but I’m fine with it as long as I see and feel the results. I know I need to save money, and after this, I’m done spending on myself. I rarely do so, so I used this trip as an excuse to treat myself, but if I get the piercing, I’m done after. 

Anyways, I’m CONSIDERING, not definitely getting or definitely not getting, considering getting a tongue piercing. I feel I’d enjoy the look, and I’m very anal about my hygiene (to the point of where I literally think I’m going to die if I don’t brush my teeth within a certain amount of time or I can’t sleep at all if I don’t shower. I’m wide awake and uncomfortable until I’m clean). I would take good care of my piercing the way I do with my current piercings.

Out of respect and to avoid any shock, I told my dad, he was like ok cool, doesn’t really agree but it’s my body and my choice and to properly take care of it if I do. I told my mom for the same reason, and she... yeah. I’d post the texts but I’m lazy, so I’ll just copy paste. Translated from Spanish.

Me: Where are you?

Mom; Home, are you okay? What’s goin’ on? Tell me what’s happening.

Me: I’m fine, but I wanted to let you know that I was considering, BUT I DON’T KNOW YET, but was considering getting another piercing.

Mom: 😵 Where?

Me: My tongue, but like I said, I don’t know yet

Mom: No!

Me; Why?

Mom: You’re good enough with what you’ve done to your boobs. And remember you’re going to look for a job!!! I don’t agree.

Me: [Best Friend’s mom] has one and I never knew until now (have known her for years, saw mom in person for first time last year and never knew)

Mom: I don’t care. I want you to be yourself and not try to imitate others. 

Me: I’m not trying to imitate anyone. I want it for myself. But I’m not sure yet

Mom: I don’t want to discuss this with you. I just wanted you to know what I think about the piercings. Please don’t ask me to support you with that. Don’t agree but you take your decisions. Te quiero. 🤩😍

Me: I’m not asking for support, I just wanted to let you know I was thinking about it out of respect and to not shock you if I get it 🗿 I know you don't like it, and I'm okay with that as long as you respect my decisions with my body, and I appreciate you doing that. Te quiero mucho. Cannot wait to see you🗿

Mom: 😍🐰🐇🥕🧐🤭😘

I texted my dad after and asked if she said anything to him about it. He said no. He saw her and asked if she was okay because she looked mad, and she said she was fine. Then she left the house to go do whatever.

I’ve done a lot of research on tongue piercings, and I’ve asked people who have/had them what the experience was like, how they felt. I bookmarked websites that talked about how to clean them and the risks that come with it. This is what I did before I got my nipple piercings, and I’m 100% happy with them

My mom is old school, and I get it. We come from different times and cultures. We have different beliefs. I just... Feel a little bad, I guess? My brother drinks and smokes quite often, especially drinks, and she didn’t freak out about that nearly as much as she did with my piercings. Piercing my tongue and nipples one time in my life is probably a lot safer than drinking or smoking all the time. I don’t know. I worry that getting my tongue pierced will further stain my relationship with my mom, while my brother’s drinking and smoking (he has driven under the influence with my and my parents in the car) hasn’t really done much to impact their relationship other than my mom realizing my brother is all grown up and not her dream child.

Maybe I’m wrong here for wanting this. Should I go through with it if it will make me happy? I know of places I can work at with a tongue piercing in. I don’t want to ruin anything but I don’t think it’s fair that my happiness (for some reason) partly depends on my mom not treating me like shit over my piercings. She doesn’t have to support me, but she does have to respect me and my decisions.

If you have a tongue piercing, please comment your experience with it, good or bad. It’d really help me with my decision. I’m also going to talk to the piercer at the tattoo shop and see what she says. The tattoo shop is VERY clean, does a great job with piercings (I saw many piercings go on while I was there last time. All well done), and the environment is very comfortable. Employees were fantastic.

Also please comment advice concerning my mom, if you have any. If I get the piercing, should I text her? Show her when I go home? Take a picture and send it? I feel I’d be taunting her in some way if I did that, but I know she’d want to see because she wanted to see my nipple piercings. ;( Please help me out if you can. I’m stuck and kinda stressed.",JUSTNOMIL
"Howdy. We're here again.

I've succeeded at severly reducing contact and gray rocking any encounter I have with The Borg Queen. My darling and I have had many a discussion about the feelings that have been going around b/w the 3 of us. We've cried some. He's resilient. I'm very proud of where he's come. 

He's becoming free, y'all. 

Today he said ""No"" to her last minute demands.

Holy hell. Hold on tight.

So I work 55+ hours a week and our work schedules are very opposite of each other. We can spend a good 7-9 hours weekly together. It's more than most and I'm grateful. I savor each moment I'm with my darling. So I was quite saddened when he told me he wasn't coming over Friday night but he promised he'd be with me on Saturday right after work. 

So I toss and turn on Friday evening. TMI: I'm currently in the 2nd year of grieving the loss of my best friend who died very suddenly. I struggle with being alone. I cry a little. I watch TV. Eventually I pass out and I spend Saturday working. It's a holiday weekend and I don't care. I'm working to distract myself and pass a lot of time until I see my darling.

4:00 PM rolls around. He texts me that he's not coming over :( Borg Queen instructs him to go directly home after work. His godparents are in town and he must obey.

My heart breaks. I'm not family. I don't have that kind of power. He's not coming over. I need his support but he's not saying no to her. 

I wait until he's off work.

5:30 PM. He calls me. He doesn't say much. I keep asking if he's going to say anything. He says ""I don't know what to say"".

I tell him to be free. Capital F, Free. I tell him that I was betting that he felt downright miserable taking orders like that. She was invading our protected time together. 

And this feeling of guilt struck me. It pierced me right in my chest. 

I heard him sniffle a little. It's hard for him to stand up for himself. He says he's parked and going inside. My heart shattered. I'm preparing my Netflix binge and readying an order at Chic Fil A. 

40 minutes later. 

""I'm on my way"".

My heart rose like a balloon. I couldn't believe it.

The doorbell rang and he was there! The first thing I asked was ""Are you in trouble?""
He laughed and said  ""Oh yeah. My godparents are fine with it. She's pissed."" 

I pulled him in for a hug and I cried. 

Y'all, I cried for a long while. I held onto him and felt a hurricane crash over me. The storm of grief mixed with guilt for needing support was a lot to take in.

She's extremely angry with us.

I needed him tonight and he came through. But she's livid.

To any moms out there reading this, I'm a bit sorry for being selfish today as I don't mean to draw him away from his relatives. I just had to cry on her son's shoulder. My parents are sick to death of my sadness and some of my friends are wondering why I'm still ""not over it"". Darling was friends with my BF so he 100% understands. We held hands the day we buried her. He's been my rock. I'm not sorry for that. I'm not.

He's invited me to see his godparents for lunch tomorrow but Borg Queen's gonna be there. I fear for my life (kidding but kinda not kidding).

Did I ruin things again?

Dammit.

Just can't get it right, huh?",JUSTNOMIL
"TRIGGER WARNINGS FOR:
Abuse, Assault, Drugging, and Assaults of a Violent Sexual Nature.

So, hello. I just found this subreddit and I have so many thoughts and things I want to talk about, but ill speak on my present situation. 

Background: [30F] Single, no kids. Basically every human (mostly FMs &amp; SOs) I've ever needed to put a deep trust into, has betrayed that trust with abuse of some variety. My own Mom being the worst of all. 

I previously choose to forgive Mom at the age of 23, for all abuse before the age of 20. [Phyiscal, Verbal, Mental, Emotional] We got to such a volatile point where I had to cut her out forever or forgive her and forge a new relationship. I had to live at home due to, at the time, unknown illnesses.  So after careful thought I choose the latter, we came to an understanding to put the past behind us and started over as friends. It was rocky at first but got better with time. Especially since I was able to move out and away, and we see each other once a year. We only occasionally get into the blow out disagreement still, the most recent being a year ago. But when that happens, to keep the peace within our four member family unit, I have to apologize even when I dont think I'm in the wrong. But whatever NBD, it's only happened 3 times in 7 years and it used to be daily. But we keep coming to back this one phrase, although minor in my opinion, I almost can't deal with it anymore.

I have had so many trauma-inducing incidents happen to and around me that either people don't believe me or they can't believe how 'well-adjusted' I am. I have a cat, a diary, video games, good therapist(s) and I stay busy. I highly recommend all those things. The trauma(s) in particular for this post however, are that in 2011 I was raped by a person, did not file/process, and unfortunately last August 2018 it happened again but I filed. Both were unrelated perpetrator wise.

I tell Mom everything, so to a degree I can sympathize that hearing that your daughter/best friend was now, for a third time, possibly sexually assaulted, defintely physically assaulted and drugged, on top of all of the other traumas I'm leaving out, cannot be easy. Without revealing too much, when found [this was awhile back now] I was mistakenly thought of as 'just a drunk', and subjected to verbal, emotional abuse from law enforcement, and had 3 untreated seizures while in custody and even discriminated against for being a [legal, not that it should matter] European immigrant in the USA. While in custody, I was declared missing and presumed gravely injured or dead [I never found out why]. So it was a basic Tuesday.

My life is just running to defuse one ticking bomb to the next, always. I cant know how I would act if I was watching my daughter go through that. I do respect that it's alot to take in, but the respect doesn't seem to work both ways. It's almost like all FM not just Mom, forget completly, in a distanced sort of way, that it was actually me, Sideways, that this happened to. I am on my own, 1000's of miles away from family, dealing with it. And I'm used to it, everyone ""knows I can handle it"". So maybe I'm partially to blame for handling it so well, idk. 

This past week my court date for the mistaken drunk arrest was up. The chances of it being dropped due to surrounding circumstances were almost 100%, but there was a chance they could pursue. They didn't catch the last person, so I had never been to court before. I had to figure it all out and I had no support or guidance. I have mental health issues because of course I do, on top it all and was understandably freaked out. [They were dropped btw, no issue.]

Mom has never been the emotional kind, and i didn't expect her to be. But i asked her [And anyone else I regularly interact with] to please not lay anymore problems at my feet. I lost my job due to once again failing health, am about to lose my residence after just recently getting out of a homeless shelter and regardless of the outcome, my future career (I graduated the day before the incident) may be non existent due to a mugshot that can't be taken back, dropped or not without money, because of stringent background checks for my line if work. I also couldn't afford a lawyer, and for whatever stupid reason PD can't meet with you beforehand so I made the decision if needed, to represent myself. I don't care who you are or what you've been through, that's a lot of weight to hold by yourself. 

The day before, Mom sent me text and called several times, stating urgent, big problem! In all caps and what not. I have aniexity, y'all. She said, when I responded, that I need to come drive xXxX miles to pick up www things bc there's no room for them because of yyy. I was frustrated and I texted back, a polite reminder that it wasn't that urgent and that unless Mom is paying for my trip I can't anyway, but to please not give me more stress. 

She called me later, and asked if she could vent, I said sure. But the vent turned from bbb to a rant about my www things being in the way and slowly started to flip out on me about it. I calmly tried to remind her that I asked not to talk about this until later in the week, but she wouldn't let up. I had to remind her that it didn't matter when we talked about it, it could not be solved in this week anyway, trying to quash it. Still kept going. I put my foot down still calm, but then I got her favorite thing to say to me ""It's always about you isnt?! Why is it always about you?! Why not me?! I have problems too!"" 

If this sounds familiar to you then you know first hand that it's never once been about me, Sideways, the OP. As this post is nearing a mile-long, I probably don't need to tell you about how awful it is for Mom to have to 'watch her daughter go through this [insert all traumas] again and again, it's so heartbreaking, why me? Daughter is so brave and strong!"" while telling me none of that. As I thought the following sentence in my head I'm starting to realize how bad this really is: At least it's not like the first time; when I told her, she blamed, shamed, and 'one upped' me. That I deserved it, FM was raped everyday since she was 4, so it was nothing what happened to me. [Mom did later apologize, to everyone's surprise.]  

I love Mom, and i know and it's evident that she has genuinely tried to change but we keep coming back to this ""It's always about you!"" crap which turns into past abuse stories. For example, my entire life I've been sick and in pain 24/7. I begged for help. Doctors said it was all in my head, Mom believed them, told my gigantic extended family that I'm a hypochondriac, spoiled brat, just acting out, crazy etc. Well by the time I was proved to be 100% not making it up, with three super serious issues that ""could have avoided possibly a decade of pain had it been caught in childhood"" the damage was overdone. She had thrown the wrong kind of pitty party, isolated me from my entire extended family and family friends, who cannot unbelieve what she told them. I even had to recently sit Sibling down and explain that I truly do have health issues and undo alot of lies Sibling was told and had no reason not to believe. If Mom had not been in the room when I was diagnosed, she would not have either. She made/has made me out to be a liar and that I enjoy being the victim. 

Her poison even affected life-long friendships eventually, as my childhood friends witnessed her verbal abuse as a kid/preteen/teen, and then she would go on to manipulate them into getting me to try and see her side. Shes charmimg, you want to believe her. I've always felt isolated and alone, with only her in my corner, despite her putting me there. 

But I FORGAVE Mom. I have tried to move-on and I'm mostly doing a good job. We just keep coming back to this stupid sentence everytime something horrible happens to me, another thing to claim victim about/get attention. Like shes mad im once again needing some comfort and it's such a hassle. No amount of trying has changed this one part otherwise. The last thing I want in the world is attention [says the lady making a public post]. I just want a hug and a everything's going to be okay, you dont have to be mom/friend of the year to do that. I know she needs mental health help, but she refuses to go. I know that if I cut her out for good I'd be better off, eventually. But for 1000 reasons I can't. But the biggest one is guilt. Not for her but for me. If I cut her out, it will eat me alive, and i do have mental health issues that could result in selfharm if I took that path. I've tried to let her go, but I love her and need her too much. That's how I ended up here. 

So I decided that it's better to live with that occasional abuse, than the guilt driving me to more madness/more than likely selfharm. I feel like if I had my own family, I could break free. That's all I ever wanted, my own family, just so I could treat them how you're supposed to treat people you love. Or even just a SO or hell a BFF that I could trust to have my back. But that's not, at present, an option. 

With that being said, I know that no aspect of this healthy, but I can't see the forest for the trees.

Is there a third option I am missing?",JUSTNOMIL
"TL:DR is the title...

My MIL wants me and my kids a son and a daughter dead... 

When i was pregnant with my daughter, my MIL pushed me down the stairs and said it was better if me and the baby dies and also if my son 7yo would die too.. my daughter is born with gery eyes (me, husband and son all have different shades of brown... all our families have brown or black eyes) my MIL hates it and wants to buy lenses to match my baby coz my baby can't have grey eyes and so she can tell everyone my baby got grey eyes from ""grandma"" 

Also she wanted to see my babies privates... i denied ofcourse and she became so mad at me.. she said i can look at my daughters privates... i told her No... she is my daughter and i've seen whatever i wanted.. and now she complains to whoever listens to her how bad i am and i wouldn't let her hold my baby or have alone time with her... 

Also she is a chain smoker and smokes with the kids around... and did i forgot to mention her hygiene... she goes to the toilet and never washes her hands and reeks of smoke... and then gets angry when my son wouldn't go to her with how she smells..a nd she takes bath once a month... make it once in 2 months during winter... 

Also if you might ask.. in our country its a system where we live in the house with the parents... and my FIL is on deathbed so my husband doesn't wanna disappoint him so we live in the same house... seperate floors ofcourse but still the same house... 
 
Our own house is under construction and it will be ready by october so can't wait to get out of this shithole... 

My MIL's daughter was pregnant with a girl and she asked her to abort the baby because she already had a girl.. she aborted and got pregnant the next time... the baby BOY died at birth... she got pregnant again and it was a girl and was aborted again and then she gave birth to a boy with a super complicated pregnancy... so now she have a teen girl and a 3yo boy... she gave bith via c-sect due to medical complications... 

When i gave birth via c-sect... i took the easy way out.. as per my MIL

My husbands elder bro wife had first baby daughter... she got pregnant again.. twin girls... aborted as per MIL's command coz they already had a girl... she gave birth to a boy later... 

I had given birth 6 months ago and got pregnant again... happy and all... MIL wanted me to abort coz it was too early.... we never listend to her (so i am a witch, slut, whore, prostitute and more that you can even think of) when i started bleeding heavily with so much pain that i had to be rushed to ER... i miscarried the baby... MIL was super happy, that even though i didn't listen to her, in the end it happened they was she wanted... 

The worst part is because the other women in the family doesn't have a backbone and listen to whatever MIL says and i am Supposed to listen to her too and when i wouldn't, i am the worst human being and i must die and my kids too coz my MIL is superior.... 

Yup my husbands family is pretty fucked up...

Edit: i do have more stories from my Inlaws... not this much fucked up but still pretty bad... let me know if you want some more...

Edit2: when me and husband were working outside the country, we sent all our money to build this house we are currently living in so we have zero savings... we moved back last year and it all happened within this year... so basically we can't even move out... the house in under my FILs name so we can't really prove we build it coz we don't have all the receipts for the money we sent to build this house for over 3 to 4 years...

EDIT3: Guys thanks a lot for all your kind words and concerns... 
For those asking us to move out, if we do move out paying more rent coz apparently my In-laws have asked for just half the amount from the market rate, we would just be paying rent and will never be able to complete our house.. but if we just stick here giving in to their demands for time being we can move to our own house my october max.. the construction guy just this morning said mid september...",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi all,

I’ve posted here before, but it was under a different account and about a specific problem with my mom. This is about our relationship in general, and what I believe is the heart of our conflict. Sorry this is a little long, just recently figured this out and I’m still trying to process.

I was recently reading an AITA post that mentioned different parenting styles, and some people mentioned how their parents treated them like roommates instead of children. And that got me thinking about my own mother, and she could never decide if we were equals or if I was her daughter.

For some brief background, my parents divorced when I was five, and shortly thereafter my mother, myself, and my brother moved across the country. My brother is two years younger than I am. My father hasn’t been in the picture since the divorce. Last day I saw him was the day we moved, by his choice.

Early on, my mom would tell me how mature I was was, especially after the divorce and the move. I think because of this (and because she lacked other adults to talk to and consult), she turned to me. She would ask me for advice and help. She would entrust me with responsibilities beyond my age, such as supervising people that came to our house (for example, if someone came to repair something, I would answer the door, show them the problem, answer their questions). Even if my mother was home, she would only appear if an adult was requested. Beyond this, she would ask me to help her write emails, to people ranging from teachers and principals to her coworkers to the HOA. She would ask me for advice in situations with others, as I would be calmer and less emotional than she would be. She tasked me with generally watching my brother - for a while, she would work overtime in the evenings and I would feed us, help him with homework, and sometimes even put him to put. Additionally, when he was older and began to get in trouble more, she would ask me for advice on punishments and how to help him. (This in turn created a very weird sibling-parental relationship with my brother, but that’s a whole other thing)

Despite, in many ways, treating me as an equal - or even more - my mom would also try to treat me like a child. This really only became a problem when I reached sixteen and began earning money and driving. Now that I was no longer constantly under her roof and control, we began to struggle for power. I would insist I was nearly an adult, capable of making my own decisions and spending my own money and going where I chose. She would insist I was her child and thus subject to her rules.

Since so much of our relationship conflicted with this point of view, I didn’t feel that way. I never really felt like her child, like someone who had to obey her and do as she said. I felt like I could make decisions and do what I wanted. I felt like her roommate in our home, like an equal with my mother. But to her, this only went one way - I was an equal when she wanted or needed me to be. But when I wanted to be treated as such, I was not. Because of this, when we aligned life was great. When it wasn’t, our home became the grounds of world war three.

And I only came to this realization a couple days ago. It explains a lot to me. Until that point, I’d never been able to put my finger on why things with my brother have always been so tense, or why my mom and I would argue so much when I was at home. I recall once, in the heat of an argument, saying she seemed to have multiple personalities, constantly changing her mind about me and what I was doing. Obviously I was wrong, but I see why I would think that - we had two totally different relationships at play, one where we were equals and one where I was her child. This shift in her behavior was so drastic that it seemed like she was a totally different person. And it also explains why things have mellowed with time, especially after I turned 18 - once I really could make my own decisions, with her having no legal input, she started treating me like an equal again. And since, our only arguments since then are when she has tried to “parent” me.

Ultimately I don’t know where to go from this. I’m only 20 now, so still barely out of the house. I suppose I’m thankful our relationship has improved, but knowing this dynamic exists between us is weird, because I still don’t know when she’ll decide to be a mom. And I don’t know if I should try to discuss it with her, or if I should leave things and see where it goes. I suppose some advice would be great, but just generally I needed to get this out. I’ve been turning it over and over in my mind the past few days, and so much had just made sense.

Anyway, sorry this is all so long. While I’m looking for advice, part of this is just my attempt at figuring all of this out. Very much still trying to wrap my head around this revelation, as I’m sure is clear by how confusing this all is. I can try to clear up any questions if y’all have them. Thanks.",JUSTNOMIL
"So no advice needed, as this isn’t really a problem that needs a solution per say, more of a piece of my personal puzzle that I just started to understand, and I’m curious if anyone else has a similar experience:

Does anyone else have a MIL (or other justno, I suppose) who’s jealous of what assortment of kids you or anyone else has? 
Background: my MIL overall struggles with the concept of “you get what you get and you don’t get upset”. She very often decides she wants something, or wants something to go or be a certain way and is upset when that’s not how it plays out. Her being jealous of what kids the universe gave others really came apparent recently as one of her sons (she has 4) announced that he &amp; his wife are having twins! She has often said she always thought she’d have identical twin girls. Not sure why, she has a massive extended family and there’s nary a set of twins in sight. But she has expressed genuine disappointment that she never had these twins, numerous times, especially when someone else does have them (case in point, her own son &amp; DIL. “I can’t believe DIL gets twins and I didn’t!”). She also has only sons herself, and her first few grandchildren were boys, so the girl specific baby rabies is strong. Never once have I heard her express any appreciation for the family she does have, versus the one she didn’t get. (Ie: personally, I’m totally content with my all boys tribe)
Other examples include:

- Being irritated &amp; bitter when someone who doesn’t “need” a girl has one (ie:  “She didn’t need to have a girl, she already has one!” , “It’s not fair that my sister has so many granddaughters , she got a girl herself the first time around!”)

- Complaining that my mom &amp; my SILs moms have daughters and she doesn’t, it’s not fair! And if she ever has a granddaughter (she does now), she’ll have to share with these daughter having women, which is doubly unfair.

- “I always thought I’d have a kid with X hair/eye colour, so and so did, but I never got to have one!” 

- To me: You’re so lucky your kids look like you, I wish I’d had/you’d had at least one who looked just like me! (My kids do all look exactly like me. Many levels of jealousy there)

-  I have two relatives that have red haired kids, and had girls after having many boys. My MIL loves to talk about both (she barely knows either) how they have all the luck, how’d they get to be so lucky, why did they deserve a girl and red heads and she didn’t?

- We were told one of our sons was going to be a girl, but surprise! He wasn’t! She told she felt bittersweet- sad she wasn’t getting a granddaughter, but glad, too, because she’d have been upset if I got to have a girl when she never did.

- When SIL found out she was expecting a girl, MIL told me that it was unjust that SIL was getting a girl on her first try, she should have had to have atleast one boy first! No dice MIL, I’m happy with being on team boy mom!

It’s just kind of come into focus for me that my MIL is jealous of other people’s kids, which isn’t something that’s occurred to me before. Anyone else have a similar experience?",JUSTNOMIL
"I've posted about my own mother before and I may again, but y'all...du fuq.

MIL had to put her own (wretched) mother into hospice yesterday. She said she needs to get away. We live on the lake in a pretty touristy area in our state. She hasn't seen the kids since Xmas. I figured I'd extend an olive branch and let her come up for a couple of days.

She got here this afternoon and it started off fine. Little digs that I ignored. Then, she decided she wants to watch the last GoT on our only TV, in the living room where my children play, and expected silence. Wut? No, bitch, I will not keep my kids quiet in THEIR space. And NO, their bedtime is whenever I fucking feel like putting them to bed. I worked insane hours this week and needed some snuggle time with my kids, not that I need to explain myself.

I know this is more of a death by a thousand papercuts thing, but seriously. 🤦",JUSTNOMIL
"Welp, guess who's got a lil bun in the oven. Actually-two buns. 

I'm having twins.

And FKH is not happy.

DH and I announced the pregnancy via facebook, nothing special, just a picture of the scan. FKH is already being racist. Came round to visit the other week, her first reaction being ""immigrants...They really do breed like rabbits.""

I'm *half* Chinese. Fucking hell, lady. Not that racism is accepted in any way, shape or form, but it's not like I even did come here from China. I was born here in the UK.

(Speaking of racism...DD has similar ethnic features to mine, FKH has decided to tell her that ""you're so cute, it's such a shame you don't have big pretty eyes"" and DH has told me that FKH has had the nerve to ask him ""does she have an eye infection? She's so squinty"". We are now trying everything in our power to ensure she does not come over unsupervised any more.)",JUSTNOMIL
"My mind loves to play tricks with me. If you're not familiar with my posting history, my JNM guilt trips me about packing up our 16 m.o. and making a 6 hour trip so she can see our baby. However,  she doesn't reciprocate, and doesn't make an effort to see our child. I however blame myself though. I do miss her and hate that she is missing out on her grandchild's life. Maybe the cancer really did wreck her body to where she is unable to visit. Maybe I'm just an ungrateful bitch of a daughter. I am writing this as I am at my inlaws' house (she has no idea we are here and if she did, she'd explode with rage). I feel like I could be better to her at least. I feel like I should be there visiting instead of here. But we are on a visiting strike to teach her a lesson that we're not jumping to her whims. I just have a lot of complicated emotions right now. Ugh.",JUSTNOMIL
"We (D(ear)H, DS3, DD1) just spent 6 days with the in-laws in the sunniest of states.  In-laws have a pool with basically nothing keeping anyone out of it.  JYfil decides to turn around the locks so we’re able to lock the door from the inside and remove the key - brilliant idea and really helped me sleep better knowing the kiddos couldn’t accidentally sneak out.  He also turns on the alarm chime so every time a door opens we know.  

Day 3: Dog Lover starts asking when we can turn off the chime.  Umm when we leave??? It’s for safety.  Thankfully DH over hears and shuts her down immediately.  It doesn’t stop her from asking multiple more times.   

Day 4: We had some friends over and the moms were outside and the dads were inside with the babes.   DS is sad he can’t get to mommy, DH is distracting him, it’s fine.  Dog Lover decides to get DS, shows him where the key is.  She then proceeds to teach him how to put the key into the door, turn it, unlock it, and get outside to the pool.  What the actual f-ck?!?!?  

How about we just let the kid outside alone to fend for himself.  I was beyond speechless all I could come up with was “the door was obviously locked for a reason” and then she just goes Oh and walks back inside.  

The only positive is that DH has finally seen the light.  I jokingly apologized to him for that but hopefully this is the beginning of the end of our arguments about Dog Lover.   Her &amp; I barely spoke the whole visit and It was honestly one of the better ones for me.  No desire to see her anytime soon &amp; will be keeping up the NC until our next forced family time, which will be nowhere near their house.",JUSTNOMIL
"
I am very angry if someone ever mention about his ex, it has happening quite often, it could be his mom, his best friend. They only talked about how bad she was but I couldn’t stand it.. I just don’t like her whatsoever if she is good or bad... Me and my fh would fight over it, he thinks it isn’t his fault not to control what people saying and I think it is not fair to me that nobody in my family will mention about my last relationship and why would I have to get through this crap myself? 

I know his ex is not good, I just don’t want to dig into it because I feel painful, jealous, and angry, that sounds crazy but the more I know how bad she was the more I got mad and the more I feel I turned into her. I heard his MIL said she was crazy and yelled at him, then I would yelled at him when I was mad... I don’t know that women, never see her picture, I just know her name bc my MIL “told” me. I told MIL I don’t want to talk about that person, my fh told her not to mention about that person, MIL apologized and she promised us that she would never mentioned about her again, and yet she did again, just now. saying that the ex was pushing my FH to buy this house while I was saying that we wanted to sell this house. Well, it triggers me again because he told me he bought this house himself and now I got a different information. Was he lie to me? Do I need to dig into that even though I know it would just make things worst...? MIL has a very bad memory, she can ask me one question over and over again. So I guess, it could be because of her bad memories, but she knows we don’t like this topic then why?..? Overall I can tell she loves me but I am very confused. I just don’t know what is the whole point of mentioning about someone you don’t like that much to your FDIL?? Do you want to ruin your son relationship? 


I really had an issue with his ex, and I don’t know why. I don’t like to hear her name, or anything relating to her, it just pissed me off. My ex had a bad relationship too but I wasn’t that angry if he ever mentioned about his ex but Idk why this current relationship I’m angry just to hear about her name.

I know the most important thing is I need to work on my self esteem and to be cool about someone past, but it is so hard, it drives me crazy that tbh I thought about it so many time to end this relationship , I know it wasn’t his fault but I am just so sick of feeling upset and ruining my feeling about our relationship every time like this. My FH is a very nice man, he is very honest and we are perfect together except something like this happened. He knows this topic is bother me and our relationship, I even have to see therapist to talk about it, but I don’t feel any better, still irritated. Is anything wrong with me? Why I am so harsh in this kind of topic? 

I don’t talk to my FH yet about what his mom said today, I was just crying and feeling upset, we are very moody now. Should I tell him about it or should I just let it go? He knows I am crying he already came to hug me and asked if everything was ok. I didn’t say anything yet, I just said I wasn’t feeling ok obviously. I think he knows what happened bc his parents just left. I think he is scared now to touch about this topic again. Am I too much to him and to his mom?",JUSTNOMIL
"I’m at my FDH’s house on my one weekend off. We had plans to go to the ren fair closer to his house, so it made sense. As I got to his house last night, they were wrapping up a birthday dinner for my FBIL. I stopped and said hello/goodbye to everyone who was leaving as I was walking in the door. 

As I was, I saw MIL walk over, throw her arms around her other two DILs, and give them each a kiss on the cheek, then made eye contact with me. I thought, “No fucking way is she going to do this shit. Not after everything that happened.” 

But of fucking course, she threw her arms around my shoulders so I couldn’t push her away, and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I am livid. You can see my post history for the screaming match we got into over the last time she tried to kiss me, but tl;dr, she thinks because I’m marrying her husba- sorry, her son, she thinks she can kiss me. Also, I should get over my sexual assault. 

FDH got into a massive fight immediately afterwards, over boundaries, how I’m tired of his family, etc etc. I’m exhausted, he’s upset, I’m furious, he’s on thin ice, you get the idea. My weekend is already probably fucked. The only good thing that came out of the argument is he admitted that he’s been trying to change himself and my relationship with his family to make everyone happy. It’s making him miserable, he needs therapy, and we’re going to move away after we get married in December. 

As far as FMIL, can I call her Mono?? Is that name taken? I feel like she really is the kissing disease at this point lmao. 

I’m going to send her a text after I leave town tomorrow evening. I don’t feel like confronting her head on after the last time. Here’s my draft. 

“MIL. The other night at BIL’s party, you kissed me, after I had made it incredibly clear I do NOT like being kissed by anyone except FDH. I am incredibly upset by your clear dismissal of my boundaries. I had been trying to meet you in the middle and make an effort to give hugs voluntarily, despite the fact I ordinarily dislike physical affection. I made an effort because I could see how upset you were at being unable to use your particular love language. However, I have decided to stop giving and accepting physical affection until you can decide to respect the boundary I have in place. My own parents do not kiss me, as I am an adult, and they respect me. I still care for you very much, but I do not like being kissed, by anyone except FDH. I hope you have a great rest of your day, and understand where I’m coming from.” 

How does that sound? Is it even a good idea sending a text, or is there another angle I should go for? I’ve never been more pissed about something. I’ve had two major panic attacks since and I’m tired of wasting emotional energy on her. 

Advice please!! But give it without talking down on my SO, please. You can see his family is abusive, and he’s doing an amazing job at taking steps towards healing.",JUSTNOMIL
"DH suggested naming his mother Amtrack because she keeps moving in whichever direction she pleases disregarding any obstacles, and ""she's old, just like Amtrack"". See my previous posts for background.

Today DH and DD were video chatting with JYFIL when Amtrack came on the screen and said ""Hi DD, Nana *first name* loves you!"" DH quickly ended the video and was very upset. When we discussed what happened, DH observed that even if the name Nana wasn't important to me, we would have gotten to this point eventually because of her lack of respect for our parenting decisions. He is understandably upset that Amtrack continues with her lobby for Nana even after three months of NC, and says he can't ever trust her again.

"Dear god in heaven how can someone honestly be this horrible. So, my oldest son just graduated valedictorian from high school. We had a small get together and almost all his closest family came. But lots of people including SSS. She of course does not leave until tomorrow. It was better when My JYBIL was here with her but he has to go home, so here I am. 

DS1 is busy having fun with friends so that leaves us where we are. With an amazingly rude woman complaining all day. Fortunately, they are staying in a hotel. But still.........
So, this morning I was given the horrible habits of my JYBIL and JYSIL. All of which were lies. Really stupid lies. Which I called her on it ignored. 

I got to hear fun stories about camping trips from 40’years ago where they were rude to their camping neighbors which is always awesome.  I then escaped with DD to Costco. Because Costco at lunchtime is still better than hanging with SSS. Even to a 15 year old girl. Seriously Saturday Costco runs belong in the seventh ring of hell, so you know it has been awful.  

I refuse to cook for her since she insulted my cooking two years ago. So, DH was supposed to grill. But shockingly after the rude comments today and just mean stories, he was done. So he decided to take them out to dinner. (My Chinese food will be delivered shortly). Thursday before graduation I had a taco feast catered because that is DS1’s fave. SSS, “At least it is not from family favorite restaurant. I hate eating there. “ 

Yesterday, when SSS has to take whole family out to nice dinner because she must. “Do not make reservation at family favorite restaurant. I hate it there. “

Tonight, when DH says he is taking them out. Guess what she said. “As long as we do not go to family favorite restaurant. I hate it there.”  

Now we love this favorite restaurant. And we are not stupid. We get the hint. Although, I wanted him to go there. But after the third time, I look at her and say, “We know. You hate this restaurant. You do not have to tell us every time. We won’t take you there. We get it.”

DH agrees. Tells her not to be rude. FIL says that she does not need to repeat herself. Because she said it one more time for good measure. FIL also said she is being rude because he knows it is our family favorite.

She is then super butthurt because we call her out. She promptly says we should ignore what she says instead of calling her out on it. Just because she is rude, we should not be rude back. Ughhhhhh. This woman. There are so many more stories from this weekend. But this one literally just happened. 

She is paying for college for the kids, so we are somewhat held hostage. But even sometimes JYFIL (although he is getting better all the time) is getting frustrated with her nastiness. So, there we go. She is only person who can get butthurt like this.",JUSTNOMIL
"Thank you to everyone on tbis sub for all your support. Im sorry that im terrible at replying to things but I read every comment and really appreciate them. 

So this month is very busy for me and my little family. Its my birthday month, we have a big vacation planned at the end of the month, and I have 2 craft shows that I was selling at for some extra income. 

We have an arangment with my fmil (and unfortunately landlord) that she has to let us know at least 24 hours in advance when theyre coming over, and to let us know what they're coming over to work on. 

So we were told they were coming to fix our AC, (thats been broken since september but thats beside the point). Okay sure, we make sure someones home. I have a craft fair tomorrow, younger sister is grounded and currently doing all of the chores due to said grounding, gf and brother and family friend are heading to a craft fair thing theyve been really excited for. 

As I may have said before both me and gf work 3rds, I worked until 6am last night, we both typically sleep until at least noon if not later. 

So apparently we had been called around 8-9ish (when were both asleep). With ffil saying that he needed to come in and shut the air conditioning off to work on the ac. No problem.

1pm rolls around, and both fmil and ffil come out and say theyre doing yard work and, ""can we get some help out here.""

No. You can't. 

So me and gf (who is developing the nicest spine) go out to talk to them about how this is a problem. They can't just come over and do whatever, we need to know what they're doing so we can make sure we can plan our days accordingly. 

Ontop of that we tried to convey that just calling and not getting an answer was not acceptable. She kept on about ""well whats the problem this is the day that worked for us"" with us continuing to try and explain that the lack of communication and not telling us you were doing this is a fucking problem. Yes you own the property but we deserve know whats happening around our house and if you're doing yard work. We have a dog who hasent been able to go outside yet because ffil is mowing and he's line agressive due to previous abuse while he was on a line. Them being out there is a PROBLEM. So is the assumption that just because you TRIED to call us means that you dont need to hear back from us. 

Any advice on how to explain this to a narc? This is so fucking frustrating and of course just what I wanted to deal with on low sleep.",JUSTNOMIL
"We are NC with MIL „Übermutter“ and her shitty family, for several months now and it’s so, so relaxing and freeing to not have her drama around... (thanks to this community and my wonderful mom who looks through our mailbox on typical occasions for MIL-spam!)

A little old story and a recent update below... 

When I was pregnant with DD I was in need of a car „out of the blue“ due to an university project I really wanted to participate in. Übermutter’s boyfriend, at that point identified as mildly annoying but harmless and really wealthy, wanted to sell his old middle-class car.

DH liked the car, we figured a car in general might be helpful with the expected child even though we didn’t need a car (except for this project, 3.5h away with public transport one way, on a regular basis) as we were living in an apartment in the center of a big city.

As I mentioned, I was finishing my studies and didn’t earn a lot money. DH works hard and earns well, but with saving for the baby‘s arrival, we couldn’t afford this car and that‘s what we told Übermutter’s bf. Both of them texted later „Don’t worry about the money, you can pay it back after maternity leave.“ and „As soon as bluesharkwithstars found a job after university.“

Oh well, we were young... and so, so stupid and accepted to pay 50% then and 50% after I‘d start a full-time job.

In between all the MIL batshit-craziness comes up, we marry, have a healthy child, bla bla bla, NC with the option to restart contact as soon as Übermutter stops contacting us on her own. (That‘s seems to not happen ever. She is so dumb.) See my post history for the past drama.

Now to the fun-part of the UPDATE (Episode „Whoops! Who dis?“):

My awesome FIL, divorced for several years, texts DH to inform him that Übermutter texted him a love-bombing message adressed to DH. They never texted before (FIL is NC as well), his profile picture is totally different, their names are not similar at all. You get it. I can not believe how stupid Übermutter is to think this would make us react in any way. We ignored it and had a good laugh together...

Sadly now comes the not-so-fun part of the Update...

On a lovely, sunny Sunday morning we are walking our new pup when Übermutters bf sees us in the town and shouts small-talk from a distance and then follows us by bike as we didn’t react but just kept leaving this place. 

This dickhead gets angry and screams that he wants his money back, as he realized we won’t be stopping and people started to wave their heads around. Pure white trash style!

The same day we transferred the money to his account, even though we have close to zero money liquid now and I am still on maternity leave and do not earn ANY money. But damn, it felt so good! No more money-guilt on my shoulders!

But I am angry as well, because 1) I feel like this money situation was a weapon to control us, 2) they broke their promise and we wouldn’t have accepted the deal if we could have known they will break their promise, 3) Übermutter and her pack of FM starts to get other people worried about us (FIL, people we know on the street, just so embarrassing,...)

To end this update, a meta-question concerning our NC-situation: What do you think? Is it slowly escalating and we should prepare for war with a lawyer or was this her „last“ rational possibility to put us under pressure? (DH and I do not agree about the interpretation of the current events, so your outside opinion might help us considering our future strategy!)",JUSTNOMIL
"Again!  It happened again at dinner last night with old friends that are in from out of town.  I don't even know how the conversation steered in that direction but next thing I know my mother is praising us for how great we turned out because they weren't scared to use the paddle and dad is agreeing and giving out examples.  Like it wasn't embarrassing enough when it was happening, now she has to keep bringing it up and I've had enough.  It was painful, humiliating and not something that should be discussed over dinner.  Ugh!",JUSTNOMIL
"FDH went to his niece's piano recital with his whole family on Monday. I was working; I wasn't invited. Just like I'm never invited to the house or any other family activities. I have been invited to attend Catholic Mass on Sundays --if I want to take the day off work to do so. FMIL is a born again Catholic and has learned through DH that I'm a born again pagan.

Any opportunity to exclude me and have her darling baby boy near her is a win. 

So tonight he's going to his niece's dance recital with the family. I'm staying home. I wasn't invited. Call me old fashioned, but I don't show up unannounced and uninvited. It's rude. FDH offered to take me along and just let them choke on it, but tonight is about his niece. I don't want to make a battle or statement out of a 4 year old little girl showcasing her accomplishments. 

I'm a virtual stranger to his niece because of FMIL. FSIL and niecelet live in the family compound, and only Shelob (is that name taken?) says who goes where and does what. Like a spider in a web, pulling the strings of each of her family member's lives. Even 33 y/o FSIL can't go out with a friend without Shelob texting FDH to try to get to her/text her/call her if she doesn't pick up the phone.

FDH has skipped holidays (Niece's birthday, both sister's birthdays, parents' anniversary, mother's day) to make his point about inclusion, and just to avoid the toxicity and fallout of going ""home."" But when his niece asks him to be there, he doesn't know how to explain why he's not. 

Monday she asked why he likes his ""other home"" better. WHO do we think told her he *prefers* living elsewhere? 

My BFF keeps saying I need to just go along. To the house, to family events, to anything FDH is invited to, and let them squawk or throw me out. I honestly just don't know how to handle it when my gut says that's the WRONG thing to do. But I feel terribly excluded and spat upon by a gently smirking spider when FDH leaves to go over there, even though he doesn't want to see them, either. I sit home and seethe that she's ""winning"" because he's forced to comply with what she wants, including leaving me home alone, or giving up his relationship with his niece.",JUSTNOMIL
"So my JUSTNOMIL aka The Red Queen has been causing me near-constant stress for the past decade and I am really at my wits end. I love my Husband dearly but he really has no sack when it comes to his Mother despite him acknowledging her down right awful antics and behavior towards me. And I really don’t know what to do anymore. 

In the beginning we got along great and had a lot in common. But somewhere along the line she decided I was ENEMY #1 most likely because I pointed out she was swindling few extra hindered dollars a month from my husband and he put a stop to it. Since then and for as long as I can remember now she’s been causing constant stress, anxiety and has gotten other family members wrapped up in the drama. I used to talk to and socialize with my other two sister in-laws (both married to Husbands older brothers) frequently then one day they stopped responding, stopped liking posts on FB or sending me invites to family events. And when it came to the invites my Husband actually suprised me and called them out on it he got the oh we thought you would just tell her. Yet they still sent invites to the others spouses. I know petty but still kinda like wtf but it wasn’t enough for me to think something was seriously up. Until my birthday last year. Me and the two SIL all have birthdays within a week of each other. I’m last though. We all used to wish each other a happy birthday on Facebook so much to my surprise when they didn’t say a single word or send a message. Yet they posted on each others walls big long drawn out posts along with a post for each of them from The Red Queen detailing how much she loves them etc But me? Nadda! And it’s not like they forgot, they’ve remembered every year for the past decade and it’s kinda hard when all 3 of our BDs land in the same week. 
We have no idea what was said to them but they’ve just made it very obvious in the last year they have an issue. 

In the mean time we have The Red Queens antics- 
- Sending me and only me scatter bomb messages at 1-2 am about rent (yes we rent from them FML) which we don’t fall behind on too often but when we do it’s WW3 and I’m often on the brunt end of her warpath.
- Sending my Husband messages about the same topics but in a much nicer tone and full of no worries and I love yous! 
- Randomly announcing she is on her way up to the house to do an inspection.
- Randomly asking us to drop everything and meet her somewhere to drop off items from her storage here at the house.
- Randomly showing up and letting herself in and then stands at the foot of our bed and start screaming like a banshee about the dishes in the sink and the house being a little messy. Sorry but I had worked a 14 hour day and then slept for 2 hours before waking up to go get Husband at work at 7 am and then go back to sleep and wake up to that shit! Ugh! 
- Making asshole comments about my before and after weight loss photos. She said she thought I stretched out the second one and made it as a joke.
- About 3 years into my Husband and I dating she convinced him to do a fake proposal to me with one of her fake costume rings that looked real. Long story short he did it and kept it going for 15 min before yelling JUST KIDDING. Clearly I love his ass as I am married to him now but that went down in the books as our first HUGE FIGHT
- Any time she shares a photo of my husband and myself she will pick the worst possible one. My Husband always looks handsome in photos but me? Not so much. And she doesn’t have to do that because she will send us copies of the good ones so why not use one of those? 

This is just the tip of the iceberg. I’d literally be here all night writing a 30 chapter novel. I just don’t know how to deal with this anymore especially with little back up from my Husband. Yes we know we need to get out of her house but right now we aren’t in a good place financially to move and just getting out of the hole we fell into a few months ago. But are there any tips for combatting her antics and keeping the peace?",JUSTNOMIL
"My apologies if this is not the appropriate sub. My aunt recently died from cancer. 2 of her 3 children were NC because she was emotionally and sometimes physically abusive. Despite their upbringing, her children (my cousins ) turned out fantastic. The oldest who bore the brunt of their mother is extremely family oriented and a phenomenal mother.

"Today is my birthday, and it also makes 2 years of NC with my Just No mother, Manic Mollusk. She’s been dialing up the unsolicited packages over the past few months, and it’s clear she’s still getting info from someone in the family. I assume it’s my JustYes, but fairly old and forgetful, grandma. 

DS3 was diagnosed with autism earlier this year.  Most recently, MM has been sending a barrage of Amazon packages to DS, with things designed for autistic children, such as weighted blankets and sensory toys. We’ve been returning everything we can, and donating what we can’t. 

She’s always continued to send packages to our son, with notes typed in all caps about how MM LOVES YOU!!!!!, and they always make me sick to my stomach. I can’t even read the bullshit “grandma” name she gave herself, which literally no other living person calls her, without getting sick to my stomach. 

Anyway... the packages have significantly increased. We are getting one every week or so, and it gives me extreme anxiety even dealing with them. We sometimes just drop off the whole box unopened at a donation center, but even just the act of finding one of her boxes on our porch is rage inducing. She will never just leave us alone, and it’s exhausting. 

We’ve notified his daycare and the local police that the rate of her contact has increased, and they are all on board, but I just want it to stop. DS has 0 idea she even exists, though he’s now old enough to understand and we are teaching him “safety” games (hide in the closet, quiet as a mouse!) and he knows where the police station (across the street) is.   It’s so difficult not to feel defeated every time she sends another box.  A Cease and Desist order would only provoke her into a dangerous extinction burst. I don’t know what else to do.",JUSTNOMIL
"LTL, FTP and mobile yadda yadda , etc etc.  Hopefully I formatted correctly , if not apologies and feel free to roast me accordingly. Also sorry if it’s long and rambling, I’m a little peeved. 


Okay so since joining this sub I have long suspected my mother of being a JustNo , but also AITA in this situation. Anyways let’s get on with it. 


Let’s start off with my mother is a realtor. And my parents finally divorced a few years ago [25F] and I’ve known they should have gotten divorced since I was about 12 but that’s another long story. 


And ever since I’ve gotten my own bank account at around 19, my mother has asked me to randomly send her bank statements so that they can do some photoshop work and change some things around so her clients can have some legit bank statements for her realtor stuff ?? I don’t actually know what she does, all I know is she has assured me that they have changed all my info. 


I’m a naturally paranoid person , so this has never sat well with me. However ,  she managed to get me a 1 bed condo completely paid off with a good tenant who pays cash and on time. At this time I still lived with dad, because he’s just awesome. He gave me access to his bank account for gas and food and the money I got from my condo was about $600 after paying HOA and saving some money. And I was going to school at this time so that extra money for books really helped out. 


So I ultimately felt like I owed her giving her  my statements and stuff. It was like once a year or so at most. So not often , but often enough that I’m still uncomfortable with it. This was when I was 19. 


Recently , I have sold my old condo to get one in a better neighborhood that’s closer to dads and everything else that’s familiar. Now I couldn’t completely pay this one off as it’s in a more expensive area. So I had to get a loan and as a result I have a good chunk of money in my bank account. Which I am gonna use to pay off a good part of the loan and then refinance to lower my monthly rent. 


Now like yesterday she had called and asked to get another copy of my bank statement. Apparently she needs it for a client. She had told me that they wanna get loan docs and that they were gonna say that the client is getting gifted this money so that they can be able to get the loan. And I am not comfortable doing this any more so I just didn’t reply and practically ghosted her. And she practically spammed my phone trying to get my statement. 


So AITA for not wanting to send the bank statement or is it just a sketchy thing to do ? 


Now this morning, my bro [18] and I were supposed to have breakfast with mom. However he had texted me at 2 am and asked to wake him up for breakfast at 9. So naturally he wasn’t gonna wake up on time. He still lives with dad while he goes to college. So he’s not exactly close enough for me to go and wake him up. And as soon as I woke up I found out that my monthly curse has begun. 


Seeing as how it’s 930 and my bro still hadn’t woke up I messaged saying we should reschedule. 


Mother “Have a little respect for me guys, you could have said something earlier instead of me waiting for half an hour.” 


Now under normal circumstances I would agree and apologize. However , my mother is late to everything. I can wait on average 15-45 min, and this is to things she has agreed to meet me with well in advance. At the most extreme cases I’ve waited an hour. And this is for breakfast or lunch or just meeting up for a quick catch up. And this isn’t very once in a while , this is to almost every meeting. I haven’t had to wait only a few times. 


So I messaged her “Talking about respect , I have waited way more hours in a car for you and waited way more times. This is just once that you've had to wait” 


Mother “Ok OP don't worry.. we don't need to reschedule.. it is ok.. I won't bother u guys anymore.. “ 


Any advice ? 


Oh and another random bit. Mother bought bro a new car December 2018. Yes she bought a new driver a new car as opposed to giving him my old car that I am currently driving. I am not really upset at the fact that he got a new car, just that dad and I discussed having him drive my old Toyota Corolla 2006 because it’s got a few bumps already so it wouldn’t really matter if he bumped it some more. But she didn’t even ask us and just told bro she’s buy him a new car. And yes he did bump his new car.  However , when all 3 of us went to buy the car , I didn’t know that she wanted to do it in my name. She agreed to give me the money and I just send the payment in. So now I am the one sending in the payments and my mom almost never gives me the cash on time. In fact , she hasn’t given me one payment this year for my bros car. I’ve been making the payments myself since January of this year.",JUSTNOMIL

"My grandma died a few years ago. We saw her occasionally as kids, but we did not have a very close relationship. I never thought much about it as a kid. It wasn’t until I was almost 30 years old that I recognized her JustNo behavior and understood why my parents didn’t spend tons of time with her. 

I just love one of my dad’s stories. His mom was always trying to be manipulative. He even warned me before my wedding that she’d probably have some “crisis” during or right before our big day. She would drop not-so-subtle hints to try to get her kids or grandkids to take her out to restaurants. My parents aren’t exactly rich, but they have worked very hard for many years and have been careful with their money. He says she used to frequently say some form of “it must be nice to have so much money,” until finally he responded with: “Yeah, it’s awesome! I can do whatever I want, and I never have to worry about where the money will come from. I love it!”

Hahaha, love you dad.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hey all.

So, today, HH and FFIL stopped by to drop things off. My lovely (said through gritted teeth right now) GF told them to just drop things and go- and they did! So I didn't have to see head nor hide of Holiday this time around. Happy news.

Not-so-happy news... Holiday apparently provided GF with half of their damn house. I'm talking FIVE bags of silverware (I already bought some) eight new glasses (we already have them) a full set of pots and pans (we. already. have. them). Like... On the one hand I am grateful, and it's nice to have some new pots... On the other we are a family of two and now have enough towels for an army.

I am aware that I am pissed far more than I should be. Really, I do know that. What kind of person gets mad at being given a bunch of free shit? Probably the kind of person who has sunk well over $500 into buying all of the shit was just provided to me, for free... Gf says she doesn't know what she was being given, and she apparently stopped them from giving her *even more shit*. We're sending back the bags of silverware (none of which matches our stuff by the way), and I am replacing the glasses I had (which I don't really like, I got them two years ago) with the new stuff. So some good, sure.

But IDK- I feel like they just... Assume GF has nothing here? We've only been here a few days, sure, but we are more than comfortable. IDK- I feel like HH and FFIL assume that we cannot support ourselves or survive without them dumping a bunch of shit on us. My parents gave me some stuff, but only what I asked for and only what I knew I would need. Fuck, HH gave GF a teapot, when she knows full well that GF has here the tea set I bought her for her birthday right when we started dating!

Maybe I just need to deflate my ego a little, and I KNOW some of this is coming from my past issues and resentment of HH... But hell, I don't even know where we are going to PUT all of this stuff! We have more storage space, sure, but not enough for all of this. And I'm a bit pissed at GF too- not enough for JustNo SO, but enough that I'm irritated... She just lets her parents hand her things like this. Ugh. Wish me luck in organizing.

UPDATE: We are filling a bag with things to send back. GF and I talked and we agree that this was a little ridiculous and boundary-stompy. Veto-ing future parent gifts (that goes for both of us) and anything from parents in the future will be discussed beforehand.",JUSTNOMIL

So about 2 weeks ago things came to a head, I got out and am safe living with a friend until I can find a place of my own. I’m only 19. I’ve spoken to my sister and she said mum thinks she’s on good terms with me despite our massive argument (she is a master rug sweeper). I have received exactly 3 messages since leaving. One to see if I was on the streets (that would look bad for her), another to see if I was coming home and another today that read: “Your work shirts and some of the other washing is washed and dried if you want to pick it up or I could drop it off if you like love Mum”.

I haven’t heard ‘love you’ from either of my parents ever since I can remember. I’ve already accepted the fact that neither of my parents care about me. But I need to make it very clear to her that I was abused by her too and she can’t just make this go away, and I don’t want to have contact until she’s going to take responsibility for everything that she let happen and everything she did as well. Can you guys help me craft a message to her so she can’t argue with it or rugsweep? Thanks to any and all advice in advance",JUSTNOMIL
"I travel to Europe often for work, and for many years now my mother has been contacting me before each trip to discuss her concerns about me being a potential victim of terrorism in France, Germany, etc. She's not just saying she's worried (as any mom tends to worry when their kids are far away)-- she insists on *discussing* the dangers with me, frequently expressing exasperation about why I'd ""endanger"" myself like this. 


If this happened just one or two times, I would laugh it off or even find it kind of sweet, but it happens *every* time, and this has been going on for *years*. I've tried everything to stop it. Reassurances, getting mad, asking her to stop, begging her to stop, hard data on how being killed in a car accident is much more likely, etc. etc. I've told her that I would no longer be able to inform her about my foreign trips if she keeps this up, but that didn't help. Reason, pleading, and hard data don't work. I have a feeling this is simply a ""ritual"" for her. 

And since my mom lives nearby, it's hard to go overseas for 2-3 weeks at a time without her knowing I'm gone. I've thought about lying to her about *where* I'm going, but then my wife and I would both need to maintain that lie for the entire trip (and afterwards), which is very awkward. More to the point, I feel like I shouldn't *have* to lie constantly about my whereabouts to my own mom just because she won't stop.

"At her best she is a walking pity party's worth of self depreciating misery, and at her worst she's a puddle of self victimized passive aggression, entitlement, and subconscious manipulation. 

**(""TLDR"" listed version is in bold below...)**

FMIL is also not the brightest bulb in the box, which she's either smart enough to use to her advantage, or dumb enough that nobody questions her motives...probably both. I don't know that she's malicious, but I do feel like she is a mean girl. 

Which I've learned the hard way.

She constantly uses triangulation to pit the people in her life against each other, so that when one of us upsets her, she can sick the rest on them. She's an expert at weaponizing ""support"". 

She did this for YEARS with FD(ear)H and JNFFIL, so then when I came along she created the same dynamic between FFIL and me. 

She gets her kids or whoever else she can, to fight her battles against her abusive SO for her... 
Then when FFIL gets upset after she relays to him that SOMEONE ELSE doesn't like his behavior, FMIL blames it on the people she recruited... resulting in a confrontation /lecture/ generally unpleasant interaction between him and whatever poor fool fell for her damsel in distress act. While she gets to be a totally innocent bystander /victim. 

For a long time her tactics worked flawlessly on me, mix in some FOG and it was usually a win win for her... until the one time she tried to pit FDH and I against each other and failed miserably.

Things have never been the same since.

At this point she's mostly been a BEC/mean girl... The common theme is a complete and utter lack of boundaries, no matter how (or how many times) we try to set them... 

**Ways I feel FMIL is a boundary stomping mean girl: she...**

**gives me the ""friendly"" advice that if I don't put out to my husband, someone else will.**

**ominously asks me if I'm sure if marrying her son is what I want for my life, while she compares him to his dad (they're actually more different than not).**

**tells me she doesn't love FFIL, but got back together with him ""because he knows how to please a woman"".**

**asks me if her son satisfies me sexually.**

**tells me she feels sorry for me when her son was diagnosed bipolar.**

**rounds up the half used beauty products in her bathroom, and throws them in old dirty/wet bags, then forces them on me as a ""gag gift"" (nearly everything this woman gives me, she calls a gag gift).**

**tries to give me an awesome zit cream she doesn't need but thought I could use for my acne ( I get 1-2 zits max usually, but I'm really sensitive when someone points them out after years of my JNM humiliating me over nothing).**

**buys me clothes, from the children's section of Walmart.**

**gets us matching dresses, both in her size. (she's L I'm XS)**

**constantly comments on my weight, saying I'm tiny, like it's a bad thing and I'm just withering away.**

**takes pictures at my wedding dress fitting that she somehow managed to give me a double chin in, from every single unflattering angle she could.**

**sends me a side by side comparison from before and after I lost weight, with two candid photos of me in a bathing suit that she for some reason has saved on her phone. Then tells me I look like two different people, and sends me some more of the most unflattering photos of me that I have ever seen. Then refuses to delete said photos that she insists on taking without my permission.**

**asks if I lost more weight, because she noticed how baggy my clothes were.**

**And possibly worst of all... tells me I ""lost my womanly figure"", but ""hopefully kids will fix that""... when I had to start taking antidepressants, and was working towards recovering from an eating disorder.**

I could go on, but I'd probably end up writing a book. 

I've always been self conscious and hyper critical of my appearance (I have pretty much zero self esteem thanks to my JNM- who makes FMIL look like a saint), but FMIL has just been making it that much worse. 

This week particularly. 

Tip of iceberg:

Monday she kept sending me pics of old used eyeshadows she thought I'd want (I don't), along with some half empty tubes of lipstick that I also wouldn't touch with a 10' pole. 

I didn't answer, 

1. because I don't want them but hate disappointing people (even people who are bothering me, and especially MIL who will use it as an excuse to melt into another puddle). 

2. I woke up with what I'm pretty sure was food poisoning, and was horribly nauseous all day. Which I made the mistake of telling MIL after her third text in a row.

This was my text verbatim:

*Hey, sorry I haven't gotten a chance to get back to you today. I  woke up this morning at 6am having to puke so I've been really nauseous and tired all day* 😕

This was hers:

*Did you eat too much &amp; then go to bed shortly after? I see what you mean about cutting dairy out of your diet.
Make note: if w/child, saltines @ bedside for morning sickness.
Which, I had none of. Well, I was on my hands &amp; knees , scrubbing the tile w/ ammonia &amp; started feeling nauseous &amp; knew for sure I was pregnant.
I loved every minute of pregnancy! To feel blessed to form this little creature growing inside, that you're creating &amp; your heart will swell with love &amp; pride.
I gained 40+ lbs w/DH &amp; rubbed coconut butter stick, all day to prevent stretch marks &amp; I have none.
And never worry, that you're gaining weight during pregnancy &amp; women use excuses to remain heavy after, but I was back in 34 Levis.*

First of all, this is a par for the course as far as how all over the place she is. Second of all, it's extremely irritating that literally EVERY SINGLE TIME I feel nauseous, the next immediate topic of conversation is pregnancy. 

I have severe anxiety/PTSD, and I get nauseous when I'm overwhelmed (which she knows). 

I'm not pregnant, I actually might not even be able to have kids (which makes it sting that much more when people bring it up). 

Then she just had to top it off with more comments about weight... 

There have been some SERIOUS transgressions in the past on BOTH my inlaws end, that were flat out traumatic and would justify permanent NC. Which I was for almost 6mo last year, until FMIL roped us back into feeling guilty for ""abandoning"" her (SO MUCH FOG). We stay LC, because FDH seriously believes if we don't, she'll kill herself...

But I'm struggling with how to move on from how much damage my inlaws have done with their just no bullshit, and it doesn't help that it looks like I'm not going to get to stop dealing with that bullshit anytime soon. 

Any advice anyone has to offer on how I might deal/cope with all this better, would be more than welcome and appreciated. If not, thank you for reading this far, and at least letting me get all this out instead of just stewing in it.",JUSTNOMIL

"So, **big surprise** \- the saga with Obliviouranus is not over yet.  I'd already made my decision to go NC before she sent this response yesterday.  I didn't even look at it for 2 days because I thought ""why bother?"".  It'll only be full of bullshit and manipulation  - guess what gang?  I was right!!

&amp;#x200B;

Here's her response to my email.  Please feel very welcome to tear it to shreds and if you have advice to give beyond NC which I'm already doing then please feel free to share!  If nothing else, get a giggle at the levels of delusion and denial she is capable of.  Honestly folks, we might just have the second coming of Christ right here - she's a perfect human!  


EDIT: For the record,  DH didn't agree to forget about my initial email and move on. Obliviouranus is trying to pull the rug sweeping manoeuvre. The same one I already shut down with my response to SIL a week ago.


\------------------------

  

Dear cptsdthrownaway,

Your email of 16 May 2019 to me (received 17 May 2019) is extremely distressing because it is untrue. My family and friends know me and would not agree with your accusations either.

&amp;#x200B;

For the sake of completeness, I deny your allegations and am shocked that you would accuse me of such conduct and, in particular, of “sexually abusive behaviours” towards DD, which is simply false.

&amp;#x200B;

I was also hurt and distressed at your allegations about GMIL’s care, in which I follow the recommendations and advice of GMIL’s medical practitioners to ensure she is looked after to the best of our ability. GMIL’s medical practitioners have confirmed their satisfaction with her well-being in my care.

&amp;#x200B;

From the time you have been with DH, I have sought to have a respectful relationship with you and to include you in our wider family.  It saddens me that we have reached such a state as I value DD’s relationship with me as her grandmother. I feel it is vital for DD to maintain and develop close and loving relationships with her grandparents and wider family and I will continue to do what I can to ensure that DD is secure in our family.

&amp;#x200B;

I discussed your email with DH and we have agreed that our best course is to try to move on from this point and to make a new start between us. For this reason, DH and I have agreed that I will accept your “boundaries” while denying your allegations. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am also willing, if you wish, to participate in family counselling to seek a more harmonious relationship with you.  However, if you do not wish to do so, I am more than happy to direct all communications through DH and, if any issues arise, I would be obliged if DH would discuss them with me rather than yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully this compromise will enable us to reach a more amicable and respectful relationship in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

Kind regards,

&amp;#x200B;

Oblviouranus

"I thought everyone in DH’s family understood just how serious this all is. I thought they knew the full story and agreed she was a danger to us. But she’s wormed her way into DH’s cousins family and essentially made herself at home. And they are falling for it.

I found out cousin and his wife have been letting her over with Aunt for the last 3 weeks. Cousins wife (CW) ‘worried she would upset me’ so kept it all a big secret. Hmmm, I wonder why it would upset me? Maybe because the government has actually agreed she’s a danger and gave me a restraining order to keep her away from me and baby? Maybe because I poured my heart out to CW about how bad things were leading up to my son being born? She knows FentaMIL stole from us, KNOWS she’s been hanging around junkies and doing drugs again. She knows everything and STILL invites her into her home, lets her play with her kids and has been giving her info on us. I don’t think she’s done it maliciously but getting cozy with FentaMIL IS malicious to us and I’m treating it that way. I’ve already removed her from having access to any photos of son and have changed all social media to prevent showing her anything I post no matter how mundane it is.

The reason i found out was again, thanks to my little brother. He screencapped FentaMIL’s newest insta pic of her holding CW’s child, captioning “now we need my baby Clyde and my family is complete.” ‘Clyde’ was her fathers name and a name she wanted my son to be called. Because he was an abusive POS and committed horrible acts of abuse on FentaMIL, Aunt and their other siblings, the name was immediately on the top of “names to never use no matter what” list. FentaMIL has built up a bizarre image of him, 25 years after his death, into this god like figure who could do no wrong and of course naming my son after him would have been an “honor”. She started many squabbles about naming my son Clyde and referred to him as Clyde in utero. 

I confronted CW about the pic and she admitted that Aunt has been bringing FentaMIL over for the last few weeks. Enough time has passed that they’ve forgiven her for things she did to Aunt. Because if aunt forgives her, everyone else should. I didn’t want to accuse FentaMIL of inserting herself in CW’s life to get closer to us because it sounds crazy. DH just thinks she has no one else since she’s destroyed every other relationship she’s had. I’m keeping my paranoid thoughts to myself because she probably IS lonely and needs her narc supply. But I can’t help but feel nervous about her suddenly getting close with the only family we have contact with. I told cousins wife the caption was weird and didn’t *she* think it was weird she referred to my 9 month old son by her fathers name and not his actual name? She completely dismissed my concerns. I made it very clear FentaMIL didn’t know him or anything about him and to keep it that way, I’ll be putting some space in between us. Hence my title which is a little click bait but it’s how I feel. I told her it was nothing to do with her or cousin themselves. If my cousins let FentaMIL into their home to play with their kids and didn’t take the situation seriously, I’d be doing the same thing to them. She acted like it was silly which confirms they truly don’t care. I told CW if Aunt had done everything to her that FentaMIL had done to me, she’d be a lot less understanding than I was. i told her she was metaphorically smacking me in the face and telling me she didn’t care about mine or my sons safety and we will be distancing ourselves from them again. She told me I was “making” her pick sides. I said absolutely not. There were no sides. They had no contact with FentaMIL long before I came along because of the way she treated aunt and made things difficult for her and her husband. And Fenta had flat out lied to them about what kind of person I was and I’d proven these past few months exactly what kind of person I am. I’m not going to do anything to betray or hurt them but it’s only a matter of time before FentaMIL screws them over. I told her it was a ticking time bomb to have Fenta in her life. I warned her as much as I could and said I’d see her soon but I’m not feeling being in her life anymore.

I just found the acceptable level of Fentas involvement in my life and having her connected by DH is enough. I can’t be around people who actively invite her in and make excuses for her actions. I’m looking through it all with a new lens and I am biased. But it’s kept us safe so far so I’m sticking to it. Really disappointed though. Am I always going to have to do this with everyone I know?

Edited to add, I don’t hold it against anyone that they want to see Fenta. It’s their choice. It just feels really exhausting to have to make major adjustments every few months because of her and I need to rant.",JUSTNOMIL
"I have been working in therapy hard and have pulled away from mil.  I only contact or respond when necessary and I do so politely and brief. I don't give any info that's too in depth. It's helped quite a bit.  There's a trip coming up which requires me to be with all his family in one house for a weekend and I'm stressed pretty bad understandably.  I asked him today if he knows there is behavior that shouldn't happen, if he thinks it's me or them that's the problem and then I asked if he expects me to just deal with everything thrown at me if he could be better at mentally caring for me and being understanding after because it's so draining and hard on me.  There's been so much and I'm tired of pretending it doesn't happen.  Right now my anxiety is peaking it's horrible and I'm cycling.  He said he knows how they are, knows it's not me, but also knows what would happen if we said anything(I do too I dealt with it first hand before and they get ugly). His dad is sick and he doesn't want to cause any tiff right now trying to right the wrongs(his dad isn't a huge issue, only when he gets sent in to defend then it's not good).  I'm an adult and I can see that.  I respect the trip he's planning but I will not go on another one after this one with them. If he chooses to that's his decision.  Any advice on how to be supportive but also not get walked all over and how to emotionally detach from the entire situation?  I have a therapy appt next Thursday so even any key points you think would be beneficial to talk about for coping or really in general to really dig and get the most out of the only appointment before this trip would be appreciated.  Your advice is appreciated too.  In Jan is when I pulled away so I'm still fresh and there is still a lot of work to be done on this side of it. I felt strong for a few months but with things piling up I back tracked unfortunately.  

Also wanted to thank this sub for ongoing support and generally feeling like people somewhere understand the frustration behind this kind of situation and are nice enough to try to help others.  It's really been a catalyst for me to try to make changes moving forward so I'm not a door mat.  Thank you.",JUSTNOMIL
"TD:LR - I said I didn’t like spinach salad. This is apparently an unacceptable position to hold because I’ve eaten spinach salad before. JNMom doesn’t speak to me for 2 weeks. 

This is an older story, so advice isn’t needed, however commiseration is always appreciated. 

So we’re standing in the kitchen discussing dinner plans and she mentions she’s making salad with baby spinach. I casually mention that I don’t really care for raw spinach. She retorts that this is impossible, I’ve eaten spinach salad before. I clarify that yes, I have eaten it, and also that I AM WILLING TO EAT THE SALAD SHE WANTS TO MAKE THAT EVENING, but spinach salad is not my salad of choice. This is apparently the wrong thing to say. 

Folks, what happen next can only be described as a tantrum of massive proportions. She slammed doors. She called me ungrateful. She swore. I told her she was being ridiculous, and was told to get out, so I did. I did not attend dinner that night, and she did not speak to me for two (glorious) weeks. 

To this day she continues to make the same spinach salad (with mandarin oranges, candied nuts, and rice wine vinegar... it’s okay, just full of sugar and not my cup of tea) for every holiday, and I ALWAYS get a comment about how much I must have enjoyed it since I ate it. TBH, I just really like eating. 

Bonus tidbit: she also makes rosemary potatoes. These are just cut potatoes with rosemary on them. FutureDH (Oct’19!) doesn’t like rosemary, but will tolerate a bit out of politeness. She DOUSES them in rosemary. They’re almost inedible at points. She knows he doesn’t like them, and yet still... every meal.

Edit for clarification: DH doesn’t eat the potatoes. He just says, “I don’t like rosemary,” and moves on. This news shocks her every time, and inevitably leads to the comment, “i didn’t put that much on there.” 

I only eat the salad on holidays, because it’s often the “fresh thing” on the table. It’s also not that I HATE spinach salad, I just don’t particularly love it. Her reaction to my opinion of spinach was the real news here.",JUSTNOMIL
"Trigger warning, mention of suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never made a post on Reddit before but have been a longtime lurker on this sub because of my JustNoMom. I wasn't sure what Flair to use and think this is largely handled, but I allow advice if anyone wants to comment. I'm mildly inebriated right now and my FDH finds this amusing and is making another drink for me in support of me posting here (he also reads this sub). I'd also really appreciate nickname suggestions for her. We have our own nickname for her that is pretty good, but it's too close to her real name so I don't want to use it here.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a woman who just turned 26. The backstory here is that my JNM and I have been VLC for a few months ever since she wouldn't give up the topic of suicide. A young daughter of her church friend tried to kill herself, and out of nowhere I got an email from JNM with the subject line ""no suicide"".

&amp;#x200B;

This would obviously be jarring for anyone, whether or not they were in a bad spot... and the necessary context is I was once suicidal, as a teenager, and took a lot of pills after a situation with an abusive ex. I'm not in that situation at all anymore and bringing up the past like that is only a slap in the face and a harsh reminder of what happened literally 6+ years ago. I'm not at all suicidal and am in a very happy and supportive relationship with FDH now. The email itself was just a rant about how she's always ""here for me"" if I ""need to talk"" and how she's concerned about my wellbeing and that I should never hurt myself again... I swear it was really just a way for her to feel better about our relationship since she was probably feeling guilty about how shitty she has been to me. It was laughable considering I don't open up to her about problems, like ever.

&amp;#x200B;

She's a low key narcissist, mostly with her religious beliefs since she is a conservative fundamentalist Christian who thinks her beliefs should be forced down everyone else's throats and that she is the authority on morality. Although this post doesn't have anything to do with her religious nutjob characteristics, note that this is core to her identity. I don't mind when people are religious as long as they don't try to convert others and don't think they're automatically better than ""unenlightened"" people who don't believe. I openly don't believe and am also bisexual (something despicable to her), and JNM can't get over this, consistently brings up her beliefs and why my life choices are wrong, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I texted her that this topic was inappropriate and to not bring it up, and hoped that would be the end of it. The email was par for the course for her, and FDH thought it was ridiculous but I could understand this was her way of reaching out and trying to somehow make us closer even though our relationship has been on the fritz. Only months before, I was NC for about two months after she was incredibly unsupportive and started screaming at me like a banshee on the phone after I said something catty. Well, then she sent a second email with the subject line ""I wasn't being inappropriate"" and that was enough for me because I have a shiny spine. It was a justification of why she was only trying to help, and why I should be glad to have her support. I wasn't buying it because her emails were totally about her, and she wasn't respecting my boundaries.

&amp;#x200B;

She then texted me a few days later asking when we could talk on the phone about my ""anxiety"" since she knew I was seeking out therapy. I texted her back, this is word for word: ""I'm not willing to engage with you until you're ready to respect my boundaries. You don't get to decide what is and is not ""inappropriate"" when I am calling the shots."" Thankfully no reply. Later that week, I called my dad and he told me he was disappointed with me for upsetting my mother. Apparently, they were on their way to a dinner with some family friends when she got my text, and she started bawling and screaming in the car and refused to go in the restaurant when they arrived, which effectively caused a scene with the friends. It was then when I began getting hints that my dad was a JustNo too, even though in the past he's largely stayed out of the arguments between us.

&amp;#x200B;

This all happened about a month or so before my birthday, and I had no contact with JNM during that time. On my birthday, FDH and I were having a nice dinner in when he was cooking for me at our apartment, then I looked at the mail for the day. Oh boy, a birthday card from her. I also got one from my grandmother, her mom. I opened grandma's card first, and it was standard, perfectly pleasant and also contained a check. My JNM handles her finances for her and is a rep payee, so she signed the check for my grandma's account.

&amp;#x200B;

I opened the card from JNM, expecting the worst. It was even worse than that. It said ""happy birthday Sharpaga, we love you very much"" and then devolved from there. She handwrote a rant about how she didn't understand why I wouldn't talk to her and that she only had my ""best interests"" in mind. She literally wrote the word ""suicide"" in the card twice, totally not understanding the point of me not wanting to talk to her and what my boundary was. The real kicker for me was that there was no check in the card, whereas she has always sent me a check with birthday cards in the past. The fact that she signed a check for my grandma and wrote ""Happy birthday!"" in the memo line but didn't send her own daughter a check amused me greatly. I didn't care about the money, just the thought process that went into these actions.

&amp;#x200B;

I texted my dad a picture of the food FDH was making for me without mentioning the card, and he texted back asking if I got the birthday card. Oh man. I said I did, and that she should not have written any of that. He texted back saying that I was ""nitpicking"" and ""wanting to hate my mother"" and that she was trying to get along and repair our relationship. I stopped responding at that point and was incredibly disappointed he was taking her side. This was only reiterated when he called a few weeks later when I was out during the weekend, and almost immediately brought this all up when asking why they never hear from me anymore and said ""you shouldn't have boundaries with family"". Mostly, I'm just disappointed to know I have a bit of a JustNoDad too, as he was usually the supportive one when I was a kid/teen.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been NC with both parents since that phone call, although I have gotten texts from JNM that I haven't responded to. I'm expecting more drama since I have talked with my younger brother on the phone recently, who asked if FDH and I are engaged. The answer is not officially, but we have plans to be and a rough timeline for getting married, hence I consider him my fiance despite not yet having a ring. I imagine it will get back to her somehow and she'll be upset I didn't inform her myself (even though we're not talking about anything at all, not just important things). Any advice from people who have dealt with serial boundary crossers and family members who support JustNos?",JUSTNOMIL
"So my GMom (Dad's Mom) has always been a bit of a JustNo. Old British Lady who lived through WWII in England and moved to Canada she has always been very opinionated. Because of this style of old British thinking there was nobody who would ever be good enough for any of her children (my Dad being the youngest.). This has led to hilarious moments in finding out it extends to us, her grandchildren, as well. For reference to this I'm currently 25 and the oldest of my parents children.

To set the stage we start with a sad fact which is that in November 2017 my Mother died after a years fight with cancer. During one of the family gatherings after her passing my DW and I (who had only just gotten married not 3 months before), noticed something interesting. My GMom had not once talked to DW at all. Not even acknowledged her. Well of course I pointed this out to my younger siblings and we quickly turned it into a game of ""how long will it take for her to talk to my DW.""

During this she continually talked to and spent time with my YB1's GF but never mine. Pointing this out made YB1 rather uncomfortable and he has officially been acknowledged as the GGC in all aspects but that's another story for another time. 

Well at the the end of all this just as she was leaving she did stop to say goodbye to me and I very quickly mentioned ""Oh I'm so happy you came, I don't think you've said bye to DW yet though so let me just go grab her so you can."" Needless to say the CBF was *glorious* and I am probably at the bottom of her favourites totem pole.

After everyone had left and it was just us there all my siblings and I (plus YB1's GF) started laughing and talking about how this was just hilarious that it took me pointing it out and blatantly making it obvious to her that I knew what she was doing for her to even talk to my DW. My Dad asked what we were doing so after a quick explanation he laughed, took a drink and said.

""Oh yeah we played that game all the time as kids with her. Started putting bets on it before people would come over actually."" 

So yeah. Turns out it really is a generational thing. She's too old to really worry about it and we honestly never see them cause they live on the other side of the neighbouring Province so it's more just a funny story for us all than anything.",JUSTNOMIL
"My MIL lives with me currently. She's basically trying to take over running the household for me. Extremely overbearing, does not respect my parenting, etc... WITHOUT FAIL whenever I say a complaint to someone, the response is ""well she's probably just trying to help.""

&amp;#x200B;

UGH.

&amp;#x200B;


So sick of it. If she wanted to help she would do things my way!

&amp;#x200B;

My toddler was not listening to me (doing a typical toddler thing) when I left the room for one second to set something down so I could pick her up to stop her from doing the thing I didn't like, my MIL swooped in and started shouting to discipline her, making her cry (I do not discipline my kids like this!!!!) and I heard the ending of it which was ""...this is mommy's house too.""

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to figure out who else's house it is that she is referring to??

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like a gray cloud is just hovering over me.

&amp;#x200B;

My SO is working out of town and he is contributing to the problem.  He is constantly getting on me about this issue or that issue with the kids, instead of just letting me deal with things my way.  Not only does his mom see that and feed into it by ""tattling"" on me to him but his mom then causes further division between us by arguing that my way is always wrong and basically demanding things done her way. She has said ""I just can't live with that."" or ""I'm not comfortable allowing that."" wtc... why are her feelings more important??!

&amp;#x200B;

He doesn't get it.

&amp;#x200B;

I do the majority of the emotional labor of the household:

planning the budget

paying the bills

planning meals

purchasing necessities etc...

I cook 95% of the meals.

&amp;#x200B;

I do all the tidying/organization in the house and I have to keep it up as no one else will put things away.

&amp;#x200B;

I work full time.

&amp;#x200B;

I just had a baby 2 months ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that this situation is causing me to develop PPD. I felt amazing before my MIL came back to our home two weeks ago. I felt like I had so much energy. Now I feel exhausted, powerless, weak etc..

&amp;#x200B;

I hate it.

&amp;#x200B;

Today she told me that your mother will always be #1, not your spouse. WTF

My SO came home for the weekend and started a big fight with me because he is disappointed about something that happened as a result of his own actions but he's blaming on me.

"Here’s a post about our wedding day. The day which is meant to be the happiest in someone’s life. Well....

Woke up to my two best friends bringing me coffee and cake in our hotel room. Putting on an “about to get married” playlist. Absolute sweethearts. Couldn’t love them more, couldn’t be more thankful. Told me I looked beautiful, cried and told me they loved me. 

My JNMom stayed in the same hotel as me, despite not talking to me for 4 months prior to the wedding. Morning of, walks past me in the hotel lobby and her only words are “see you there”. Great, thanks mom.

Get multiple calls from my husband saying that he will be late to the wedding because his family are taking too long getting ready. My SIL was the officiant. Apparently she was doing her hair, as we’re all his aunts and my JNMIL (almost all female family). Literally our wedding was postponed by 45 minutes because his family wanted to curl their hair. Ok. I cried. 

Get to the beach, the entire plan of me walking down the beach ‘aisle’ had been changed without my (nor my bridesmaid’s) knowledge. There is no longer an ‘aisle’ for me to walk down. I actually had to walk down the side of a public toilet in full view of our wedding party to get to my groom. We only figured this out when we pulled up in the car and nothing was how it was meant to be. 

Prior to this, while parked in the beach parking lot a friend of ours, belligerently drunk, tries to climb through the window of the car, yanking my veil off. Bridesmaid #1 takes him away and walks toward the wedding party. He then decides to yell that I need someone to walk me down the aisle (this has never been something I wanted) and insinuates my mother should be the one to do it. Very awkward considering.

I get there, ceremony is nice. Beautiful. Our song is played by strangers by accident - actually magical.

Then.... JNMIL’s first words to me are “you’re wearing the ring the wrong way round” then grabs it off my finger and changes the position. Ok. (I changed it back as she turned away). Nothing was said about how happy she was, or how nice me and my husband looked. Nothing. My mom was worse. Whole other kettle of fish.

We planned to stay at the beach and enjoy each other’s company, get to know one another as we are from different countries and this was the first time most of us had met (small wedding of 14). JNMIL convinced everyone to hang out at her fancy hotel. Mostly the guests were the grooms and they wanted to go so I felt I couldn’t say no. 

We get to the hotel and go straight to my JMIL’s room. Spend half an hour there. WE LITERALLY JUST GOT MARRIED WHY ARE WE IN HERE I scream inside, politely telling my husband I want to leave FOR HALF AN HOUR WHILE HIS MOM LAYS ON HER BED talking to us about herself. 

We finally leave. Get a drink, spend 5 minutes alone before his aunts join us, JNMIL doesn’t join us. He leaves to get a drink from his moms hotel room FOR HALF AN HOUR AND DOESNT ANSWER HIS PHONE. 

Cut to... we get to our reception - a cool local brewery where we spent A LOT of money for 14 people to eat (separate local caterers, not that it matters). His mom assumed we hadn’t thought of feeding people. Ok. His mother didn’t say ONE WORD to me the entire evening and according to my friends did not make them feel welcome. I also spent half an hour consoling my 10yo nephew because JNMIL made him cry. She made her grandchild cry at her sons wedding. 

At the cake cutting part... she tried to cut up the cake before we arrived, my SIL stopped her. When it was time for my husband and I to feed each other the first bite of cake, she literally shoved me out the way and tried to feed him his first bite. Ok. 

His 65 year old aunt then does cocaine with our friend all night, stole 2 bottles of my bridesmaids champagne and drops it on the foot of this ‘friend’ causing him to bleed everywhere. Back at the hotel room shared by two AuntIL’s, SIL, MIL and 10yo nephew, Cocaine AIL strips COMPLETELY NAKED in front of everyone and tries to fuck our friend. IN FRONT OF ALL HER RELATIVES. 

The rest of our honeymoon was spent with my MIL calling and texting my husband, especially in the mornings (morning wood blocking much?!). Like chill. We’re only gonna be gone for a week. 

So yeah, that’s the story of my Jocasta JNMIL and her flying monkeys at our wedding. I’ll save the story of my terrible JNMom for another sub....",JUSTNOMIL
"First I'm on mobile and cant figure out how to flair. This would be probably Gentle Advice Wanted and Am I The Asshole.

RQ had her brain surgery. It was very successful. Older sisters did a lot of the transportation/visiting/organising. I dont have a car and cant drive so I wasnt much use when it came to logistics. I did visit though.

Ever since RQ has been singing my sisters' praises because they were so supportive and went above and beyond!!!! (They did. I can admit that.) They dropped shifts at work etc. All good things.

On getting home RQ asked me to ""subtley"" find out how much money my sisters had lost in dropped work days/petrol costs etc. She didn't want anyone to be out of pocket. Nice! Honourable, even.

I did some guestimates and all that. Now, my expenditure was a fraction of my siblings. Negligible really. I dont need the money back, but part of me is really rankled over the principle of it. Because who didnt get paid back for travel expenses? 

Me.

My mum is all about money and ""fairness"". She uses it as a mechanism of manipulation and control and I HATE that she seems to spend her whole damn time totting up the value of her offspring and finding me wanting because I'm not useful. Or earning. Or whatever.

If it was a one-off incident I would shrug it off, but it's one of many times where mum has promised to pay me back and then didn't while falling over herself to make sure she kept her financial promises to my sisters.

Add that to the whole: oldest sister will get a bigger chunk of inheritance because she looks after us"" and ""middle sister will get a bigger chunk of inheritance because we owe her."" And I'm left feeling a bit crap.

And it's really not about the money. It's about the fact that mother uses money to show how much she values others, and it turns out I'm not even worth ten quid of train fare.",JUSTNOMIL

"So this is an old story, but I was reading a wedding one on here this am and we're expecting a visit from Gran-trum on Sunday (update on that later). 

So DH is an only child. I'm the eldest of 3. We got engaged after 5 years, decided to get married 5 months later. DH is not a big crowd person, I'm Scrooge. We decide a small wedding.

Up until this point Gran-trum has been all ""oh whatever you decide will be wonderful!""

So, we decide on a wedding with two witnesses (think courthouse) with a large reception party afterwards. 

Not. Acceptable.

CBF from space and crying because she ""won't be able to see her boy get married""
'actually, you're the witness so you world be able to see it'
""Oh. No. That's not appropriate""
Me: okay, see you at the party!
""Party?""
'yes, we're having a party afterwards to celebrate'
""As the reception?!?""
Me: yes
""Oh no! That might be how *your* people do things, but that's not how you do it""
Me: look what's the problem?
""I won't be at the wedding and it just hurts my to know I'll be sitting 3 miles away KNOWING my baby's getting married and I'm not there""
Me: but I've told you can be there. The only way you'll be getting any closer is if you may him yourself
""No. It's not right""
Me: okay, well we're going to get married in a destination wedding, get a honeymoon at the same time. We'll catch up with you when we're back

She then sulked for days. We were living there at the time. DH still deep in the fog and feeling it, starts getting really stressed. I tell him, I'm not happy about this, but we'll change the wedding to include more people (only an additional £50 or so to change the room), I'm not happy the way his mother's acting. He assures me he'll talk to her (he tries) and things go back to 'normal' and now she's so 'excited about the wedding'

So. She then starts shouting me through to her room over the next few weeks to show me wedding dresses she thinks I should buy. I hard no all of them. She keeps on at it. I tell her to stop, I don't want her picking a wedding dress for me after she's already got her own way about everything fucking else. She starts crying. I don't care. She starts the mega sulk again. DH starts to get stressed. I refuse to back down, instead going on dress strike and end up not buying a dress until 3 weeks before the wedding because I don't care by this point about anything.

Fast forward to day of the wedding. We've booked a hotel for the reception with a buffet option, because we both at this stage are exhausted from living with her and just want to get the wedding party over with and go home to our house which has finished renovation.

The ceremony goes okay, my mum as my witness tells his mum what an honour it was to be chosen and how proud it made her. CBF. 

Get to reception. Gran-trum sets up in corner of the room, hubs and I mingling about in the middle. Anytime a guest turns up to reception, guess who starts waving and immediately shouts them over? ""Jean! Mary! Come see me!""

My mum takes Gran-trum to introduce her to her side of the family. Gran-trum does not return the favour instead returning to her corner to hold court.

The cake is ready for cutting. We cut the cake. The buffet is served, DH goes to start his speech saying thank you here's the food (big deal for him) meanwhile Gran-trum has clicked the foods out and is happily digging in whilst the room of 50+ folk are just staring.

""Gran-trum, what are you doing?""
'oh I thought the food was out'
""No. Sit down please""

The revolution wraps up, me DH and a few friends move to the garden bar for a few drinks before heading home. Gran-trum remains. She's drunk. Decides she's getting a taxi home. Magic.

Taxi arrives mud glass of wine. Slaps my friend on arm ""is that my taxi? Go get him to wait""
Friend: I don't think he will wait
""He certainly will if he wants his money, go tell him now""
Me: go tell him yourself and get your arse home whilst you're at it, you're being rude.

CBF but she leaves. 

The woman has tried to ride over every major event in our life. Buying a house (2 drama stories for that, seperate purchases), baby name, smoking around the kids (I enforced a strict no contact for a year), work, everything. DH is now done.",JUSTNOMIL
"A bit long, TL;DR at the bottom.

I’ve been with my husband (34M) for 12 years. We got married two years ago abroad to simplify our migratory status there. No family was present. We moved back to our country (Mexico) in December.

My MIL and SIL (28) insisted we needed to have a “real wedding” (reception). For months my SIL said she would plan it and do everything (my FIL is very well off so he would pay for it). I never wanted a wedding and find formal events and being on the spotlight stressful, husband also didn’t want one. We eventually agreed to do it. I wanted to make them happy and to bring our families together.

The reception would be planned by SIL and in their city (we live 3 hours away).

Planning was simple enough, SIL looked at 2 venues, we chose 1, and it was a package deal so she only had to find vendors for flowers and cake elsewhere. My mom is providing all the alcohol. Of course, MIL and SIL are acting like it’s been a huge inconvenience. We’ve been appreciative all the way regardless.

I made the mistake of trying to make the best of it and enjoy the party. Looking back, I shouldn’t have invited anybody from my side other than my parents and made it clear this was THEIR thing and we were doing it for them.

Well the party is 3 weeks from now and yesterday MIL called husband out of the blue and unloaded all of this:

* Why was I not doing more to plan the wedding (everything is done). Repeating that they are paying for it.
* She found out we put a bank account along with the gift registry in the invitation: How dare we? It’s incredibly tacky and that’s not how he was raised! Also, why was is it my account instead of husband’s? (We added the account because some guests asked for it, SIL was the first to suggest it but I doubt MIL knows that).
* Why was I not doing more to find a job?? (Haven’t found one since moving back, but I’m not worried nor in need, I have enough savings, I’ve always supported myself. She has never worked and doesn’t have a degree).
* Why was he letting himself be “bossed around” by me? (Husband thinks this goes back to the move abroad, since we moved because I got a scholarship for a Masters. Maybe also she thinks I made him add the bank account to the invitations, but who knows!)

The craziest and most hurtful ones:

* Why have I never done anything to fit in with his family and for them to like me? (Apparently, they don’t like me? I never knew!). I’ve been nothing but warm and respectful towards all of them. I’m a little introverted and don’t have a bunch in common with them but I do make conversation and I’m in on every family joke and quirk. We traveled with FIL and SIL 1000 miles and back by car to go to a concert in February. SIL came to see us abroad and we traveled together for 24 days! We were over at their house for mother’s days and brought MIL a present. (She has never wanted to come to our home). It makes no sense. We already have gifts for all of them to thank them for throwing us the party.
* She hates that I call her “by her first name” (I actually very rarely use her first name but I do use the informal “tú”). She now wants to be addressed as Mrs. (señora) and I guess the formal “usted”. She even said that if I ever call her by her first name again she will call me by a nickname that she knows I hate (yes, that childish). After TWELVE years of knowing each other! After last Christmas she told me I was now her daughter! In case you are thinking it makes sense in our culture: it really doesn’t. Even the friends of husband and SIL address her informally. Husband calls my mom by her first name.

Anyway, I wish I never agreed to this stupid party and then I could just not see her for the foreseeable future. I’m now worried about her hate spreading to my family when they get together at the party. I also have to decide if I’ll just suddenly address her formally. Should I tell her she needs to address me by my degree? (jk... kind of).

I know canceling will just make everything worse since they’ll lose a lot of money and then they’ll have good reason to hate me. But I really dread the prospect of being there and having to be incredibly thankful while knowing she doesn’t even like me.

Any advice?

Additional info:

* SIL has been dating a guy since December and MIL LOVES him. I don’t know him well but I know he calls them Mr. and Mrs. and he’s extroverted.
* Also, SIL just started a very good job with good pay (she finished a Masters last year and was also unemployed for months supported by dad).

Our theory is that now in comparison I’m not good enough and MIL has decided to dislike me retroactively. Thoughts?

TL;DR: My in-laws are planning and paying for a wedding reception for my husband and I even though we didn’t want one. Now MIL has suddenly unleashed anger and complaints about me, saying that I’ve never done anything to earn the family’s approval and that I should now address her as Mrs. instead of by her first name. The reception is in 3 weeks and I don’t know how to act around her anymore.",JUSTNOMIL
"So GMIL has apologized for snapping the other day. We had a short talk where she explained to me and DH that she was stressed because we had come come later than expected and she'd been afraid something had happened to us.

She did say something similar to the comment that kicked all of this off, but her attitude about it was much different. She remarked that ""when you're old, you worry a lot about your family"" and made another comment about her help with DH and Kiddo but this time it was that she ""treated them like they were her own."" She said they were her ""babies"" but in a way that you could tell she was joking. Overall the conversation was less ""I RAISED THEM THEY'RE MINE"" and more ""sorry if I seem like I worry too much but I have a soft spot for you guys.""

DH and I have talked about it since. We believe the truth of the situation is that GMIL is/was only trying to help and (whether because of her stroke or because this is just how she is) did not realize how she was coming across, and worded things poorly/in a way that could be easily misunderstood. DH said that in the past when Kiddo was very young there was some concern because Kiddo's mom at times felt like GMIL was trying to make her do things her way. But looking back on it now DH feels that GMIL was just trying to offer advice and KM interpreted this as ""GMIL is trying to take over and force me to do it her way."" (Which fits with KM's personality.)

DH said when he was growing up GMIL would sometimes talk to him about her helping him out, but the focus then was on his mother, not on him. He said GMIL's comment was ""Your mother and I haven't always gotten along but I'm glad I could be there for her to help out with you."" Which at least in my interpretation doesn't have any implications in it of GMIL ""raising"" DH or anything like that.

So as kind of a tl;dr: DH and I talked and we think GMIL didn't/doesn't have any malicious intent or any desire to take over, but rather that she is bad at wording things and doesn't always realize how she's coming across. All of which has not been helped by the stroke. We believe she only wanted/wants to help and that a lot of this can be chalked up to poor wording, we also suspect some of the ""weird"" things she has said are things she doesn't actually even believe but the result of the stroke and declining health. We also believe this kind of thing has amped up, so to speak, because her health has sharply declined and we think this may sadly be the beginning of the end.",JUSTNOMIL

I have just rationalized for years to avoid stress every time. I face the trouble because I have hated complicated work and situation. So I have reminded that “it would be alright” or “everything would be ok” like this without any efforts. 

I have been considering right way to be in a positive but I realized that it is wrong ideas in mind. It was just to purge my bad feeling and just wanted to run away from present situation. I have found out that I had to work hard in order to get times to be done. I had been avoided these actions before because it was very stressful.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am getting to know if I keep this way stressful. I will stay only this spot and thinking spectrum will be restricted. 

So I am doing all my best to solve in something happened(it might be a bad situation) no matter what the result is. 

I wanna be a generous person in a bad situation. Need more flexibility to face problem with less stress. Anyone has experience on it or any tips for me! It will be very helpful for me in the future.",JUSTNOMIL
"I posted about this before but just got some updates. To summarize, MIL said she'd help with 30k for a down payment, then reneged saying it was too much of a hassle. I was thinking she might have a cash flow issue. Then she made a copy of my house key without my permission and kept it.

Anyway, she just sent a bunch of pictures of her new luxury car #7 (they have 7 cars for 2 old people, all of them are luxury cars) which cost probably 80k...so turns out it wasn't a cash flow issue.  She has spent close to 200k on cars this year alone.

I haven't responded because I don't even know what to say. I personally would not buy this car as I don't like the look, but I'm just not sure what she's trying to achieve here....why send a bunch of pictures of your new car after reneging on a financial promise and making a copy of my house key without asking me?",JUSTNOMIL

Small update on the Montalvo Family. 

Baby is doing well, as is My wife and daughter. After the whole episode with them showing up at our house uninvited, my wife eventually decided that she wanted to speak with her father again. They have been communicating recently, but things honestly aren't going great in terms of making progress to repair their relationship. FIL still tries to shoehorn MIL into every conversation, won't speak in depth about any of the issues that my wife brings up, and just seems to continuously not listen to what she has to say. I'd say I'm surprised but I'd be lying, this has been his MO ever since I've known him. He's not a man in touch with his feelings and is the definition of a flying monkey for MIL. I'm probably going to have to dip my toes into the just no FIL subreddit coming up soon. My wife invited him to see our son at one point and he came down and did it. I told my wife I would be fine with it, but it turns out I wasn't. After he left I told my wife about how not OK with it I ended up being and we had a great talk about it. We decided until further notice he would not come back. My wife relayed this to her father and now, apparently, he wants to have a conversation with me. I'm looking forward to that one personally. But this update isn't about him, it's about MIL. 

My SIL had her baby a month after we had ours. Her kid is doing great, they're great, everything's great. MIL offered to watch their new son while my SIL finished up her master's degree so she has been down in our area regularly taking care of my nephew. She has still managed to flake on them, much like she did with our first child, but not nearly as much. So MIL would stay with them starting Sunday mornings, stay the whole week to help with the baby, then leave Saturday morning. One weekend, after the weather finally warmed up, we planned on driving over to finally meet the little guy. 

My wife, being the ever so caring person that she is, reached out to her mother and asked if she wanted to meet her other grandson, her FIRST grandson, for the first time that weekend by staying a little later and heading back home Saturday afternoon instead of the morning. She said no. 

Her reason? 

She had a hair appointment. 

The woman neglected meeting her first grandson in order to get her hair done. 

Obviously my wife was hurt and pissed, I was more pissed than anything. In all the talks my wife would have with her father, he would always shoehorn how my wife just needs to meet her mother halfway and then they can move forward. Welp, offering to allow her to meet her grandson for the first time was a hell of an olive branch, and it was a hell of a halfway point in my eyes. She spat on it to get her hair done. Fuck her, I'm beyond done with this shit. At least I want to be.

Why am I telling you guys this now? Well tomorrow is my SIL's wedding reception They got courthouse married on Friday and Saturday are having a gathering of family to celebrate their nuptials. Of course, MIL and FIL are going to be there. They're going to want to see their grandkids. I've been stewing about this for over a month ever since she neglected to see my son and I am honestly not well equipped emotionally to deal with this. I do not plan on making a scene at SIL's celebration, that would be a huge dick move. But guys, I'm absolutely livid that I have to interact with these people. I am disgusted by their behavior and want nothing to do with them, but I have to put on a fake smile tomorrow afternoon and watch them put on a show and pretend like they're actually interested and involved in their ""other"" grandchildren's lives. 

I'm not happy and just need to vent I guess. Either way, any and all advice is always welcome.",JUSTNOMIL
"My bf called my MIL to tell her we found a home (and my boyfriend didn't ask for her input, after the big problem we had had in the past with her regarding houses haha). She didn't take the news well and was already asking tons of things about it because she has to know every detail and she was like ""well you will use my sofa and my chandelier"" and so on (yes, they are orders, not favours). My boyfriend didn't answer. And then she began saying in a very sad tone ""well I guess my opinion doesn't matter for you anymore. I guess I'll just shut up with all my worries and love for you so that I'm not seen as boring"". Clearly baiting and trying to emotionally manipulate him so that he said something like ""oh you're my mother, say everything you want and we will do everything"" as he used to say in the past. But no. My man, without missing a beat, replied ""yea that's good, thanks. We're all different people with different tastes so just let us be and live our life"". Oh my God.

"TW-trouble conceiving mentioned 

So I posted the other day about my mother who hijacked my wedding so I thought I'd tell you about the time when I was 14 and she told multiple people I had breast reduction surgery and had had an interracial baby (her words not mine)

So one night I was walking through Walmart with my dad step mom and little brothers and my cousin called me.
C:""so I my new boyfriend told me something very interesting your mom told him about you""
M:""oh God what did she say-wait who's your boyfriend""
C:""guy your mom used to date""
M:""aw you guys would be cute together so what has she gone telling people now?""
Cousins boyfriend comes on the phone
BF:""Well.....she told me you had breast reduction surgery and I just thought you should know""
C:""she also told me that you had a baby who is biracial with guy who harrassed you at the dance last year""
M:""Well I can assure you both that my boobs are still just as big as ever and I have never had a baby.As a matter of fact I just found out the other day that I have PCOS and will have trouble conceiving""
C:""We knew it wasnt true we just thought you should know so people dont catch you off guard with questions""
M:""thanks well I'll talk to you guys later we're heading to dinner now love you guys""

I got off the phone and proceeded to laugh hysterically while recounting what was said to my dad who had been giving me weird looks hearing my end of the conversation.I proceeded to be asked by almost every family member I ran into after that about both things.She of course tried to deny but coincidentally just a week earlier she had called to pester me to get said breast reduction surgery because the insurance she had on me would cover it.I promptly laughed her off the phone and then everyone in my grandfather's hospital room had a nice laugh at her-including the nurses",JUSTNOMIL
"So, I'm getting ahead of the curve a bit and my anxiety has been in overdrive already... My sweetheart lands here this time next month (yay!) and we've planned so much fun stuff so he can the as much as possible (double yay!) before I fly back with him for the rest of the summer (so much yay, I might die!!!!!!!)

However, it isn't all sunshine and rainbows. How can it be. After a year and a half, this is the first time he's been able to visit me and so it the worst time he is meeting my parents. This includes my mother.

I have posted about her before... Don't want to go too much into that. She won't be apartheid to put me down in front of him, or passive aggressively point out that I never visit and it's been months since she last saw me (I'm snowed under with work so even if I wanted to, I couldn't). She always calls me out on my weight and my anxiety and anything 'not normal' like everything I like to do that's very solo...

She also, will likely be delightful to his face, even if being insulting at the same time. She makes it so that any insult doesn't sound like one until you realise what she just said... And she is the sort of person to lay into me afterwards in private about how his no god and all the opinions (she did this with my now exH... Which she feels proved her right all along. She wasn't... Different reasons).

My heart isn't one to be very passive, but I have forewarned him. He already dislikes them from my background but I've asked that he not judge them before meeting them. He's said he will keep the peace. I just need advice on how to handle her...

I will always defend him, but I don't want to cause more drama and don't always see what's happening in the moment. I don't want to make things awkward. I don't need her approval, but I know she would try to make things difficult for me... And she will probably bring up that I've seen him more in the last year than her and he's in a different country. She has already said that a few times to me...",JUSTNOMIL
"Bit of background - My mother is one of those ppl who is sweet to your face but as soon as you're gone and the door is shut, she will bitch about you to whomever is listening and if you don't agree or give her sympathy, she turns on you. She's also very jealous of everyone and every thing. So we don't have a ""special"" mother/daughter bond. We can get along but I didn't have any qualms about choosing my Wedding Dress without her present.

It started when my SO and myself were doing Wedding arrangements several years ago; we were having difficulty choosing a song for me to walk down the aisle to, took me till about one month before we said ""I Do"" to find one that really spoke to me. So when I found it and SO heard it we both got a little bleary eyed and mushy over it before agreeing that this was defiantly the song. At the time I was on Facebook with my FFIL and FBIL online too, so (it being OUR choice and really excited) we sent them a link on YouTube and asked what they thought.

They both said it was very sweet and the best we'd suggested so far, so it was decided. FFIL asked us whether or not it could be shown to my husband's mother and Aunt who were due back from shopping later that day. We said yes of course as we were excited to find and share it with everyone. Long story short it reduced them both to tears of joy.

Now the good part; I went round to my parents house afew days later (as we'd been at work) to update them on our plans and tell them about my song. Dad had no issuess whatsoever and Mum liked it when I played it for her.  

Then I said that my SO's family liked it too.

As soon as those words left my mouth; I noticed my mother's face sink like a stone. Her brows went down, her eyes squinted and her lips drooped. I figured what was coming next as I'm so used to her bullshit but I was happy things were progressing and I could mark something else off my list.

Mother: Deadpan voice - ""FMIL and Aunty have heard it already?""

Me: Happy, excited - ""Yep! They cried apparently, bless them! And his Dad and brother like it too!""

I carried on talking regardless of her tone and face about this and that for the Wedding all whilst my mother looked like I had suggested we put out dog muck for our table decore.

It was two days later exactly when I next went round and talked to her about it again.

Mother: blunt tone - ""So, you're still happy to be getting married?""

Definate ulterior motive here. I smiled regardless. There was no way I was doing anything to change it now.

Me - ""Yep! So glad things are all nearly done and we can just enjoy ourselves on the day!""

...Silence...

Mother -""...Don't have 'that' song to walk down the aisle.""

I dropped my happy face and glared at her.

Me - ""Why not? You liked it when I played it for you.""

Mother - ""....It's too sad!""

Bullshit. She was just jealous that SO's family had heard it first and looking for any excuse to make me change my mind. It was now getting very close the day and I'd had enough.

Me - ""Too late. The ink's already dry on the paper, mother!""

Mother - ""But..!""

Me - ""I said NO, Mum! It's what WE have chosen! It is what WE want! End of story!""

She looked like I'd slapped her and didn't speak to me for the rest of the night. The next few times I went round I spoke to mainly my Dad and sister about everything when they asked about it, mum only put in small input when she realized I wasn't going to break. Fortunately, she didn't do anything else and our Wedding Day went very well with everyone enjoying themselves 😄.

EDIT: For those of you wishing to know the song, it was; Edwina Hayes - Feels Like Home. Maybe not the most romantic to some for a Wedding, but it struck all the right cords with me and my husband 😊.",JUSTNOMIL
"Title supposed to say ""gearing"" not getting, lol

On mobile, see post history, etc, etc, etc..

I've had no contact with Jack-Ass-Ta since the Christmas blow up. SO had had minimal contact, mainly through text.

SO went with BIL (who Jack-Ass-Ta dropped off at our house) to see their grandmother. While dropping BIL off Jack-Ass-Ta made a comment ""it sure would be nice to be invited in"". SO ignored her. Visit with Grandma went well.

Youngest daughter (YD) turned 7 this week. The day before her birthday, I was awakened by phone ringing.. it was her. Nope not answering that. She left a voicemail that she left gifts on the porch and had hoped to see YD.

Why in the ever loving fuck would she think coming over here without SO here would be a good idea? After she lied about our last encounter (""She and OD screamed in my face for ten minutes! How dare you tolerate them abusing me! "" 🙄)

I let SO know. He agreed it wasn't cool for her to just show up and he definitely would want to be present for any interaction. She left him a teary voicemail about ""well she tried"". Yeah, tried to trap me. Lol, no thanks.

I said I had no issue if she wanted to meet with him and the girls for ice cream the next day (YD actual birthday) and see how it went.

It went decent with only one borderline jab made.

I just.. feel it coming. Hopefully I'm wrong. Maybe she senses we've been discussing getting married and him adopting middle daughter and YD... We'll see.

I guess I'm anxious about actually seeing her face to face since the Xmas blow up.

"This is really just a vent, and it might not be very coherent so I apologize for that.

I mentioned this in passing before, but after my father died, he left us a good amount of money to live on. A few months later, some random distant cousin of my mom’s got in touch with her claiming her husband was abusing her and their daughter. Mom let them come stay with us, and we all lived together for about a year.

The cousin slowly made my mom dependent on her, at which point her husband showed up, the two having ‘miraculously’ made up. Then they convinced my mom to move several states away with them for this big oil deal they had going on or something like that. Mom fell for it and we moved. Almost immediately after, they started stealing large amounts of money. In addition to everything else, they convinced my mom to make Cousin power of attorney over her accounts.

I bring this up not only because of how awful and deceitful it was, but because this event is, in my opinion, what truly destroyed the woman I had known to be my mother. My dad’s death dealt her a blow, don’t get me wrong, but getting scammed so blatantly by family (distant relation aside) absolutely broke her. She never recovered, and would only go on to get scammed two more times by people she trusted (including more family…).

Around the time Mom was figuring this out, we were getting settled into our new house. I was eleven and had never lived anywhere other than my childhood home. Add that to the still fairly recent loss of my father, and I was pretty overwhelmed by all the changes. Mom let me sleep in her room for a few nights as comfort, and I decided to stay with her during the day for a little while, too. At least until I was feeling better and ready to go get my room unpacked.

That took over a year.

Not because of me, mind you, but Mom.

Once it became clear what was really going on with this so-called ‘oil business’, she completely collapsed. We had my grandparents with us (Mom’s dad and stepmom), but they were both extremely old and not much help. She turned to me for emotional support, by which I mean I had to literally stay in bed with her all day every day unless I was in school. I had to sit there and watch TV with her or read or listen to her sob and cry. The latter she did countless times every day.

I hated it almost immediately. This was not the kind of life I wanted to have. I had no privacy, no personal space, nothing. There were nights where she wouldn’t let me sleep because she was so miserable she needed me to stay up and comfort her.

Eventually, I put my foot down and demanded my own room. We lived in that house for two years, and I only spent the second in my own bedroom. Mom more or less accepted it at first. Some nights, she slept on her own without issue. Others, I’d literally have to barricade the door with my body to keep her from getting in and physically dragging me back to her room. Once, she did get ahold of me and pulled me screaming across the house to her room. We lived in the middle of nowhere on a cul-de-sac, otherwise, I imagine someone would’ve heard and called the cops.

This behavior continued even after we moved back to our home state. This time, she guilted me into staying with her for several months, giving me a date when I could go back to my room. Of course, once that date rolled around, she begged me to stay longer. She’d scream and cry and grab me and refuse to let go. Once again, I had to tell her to knock it off and take back my own room.

Years later, it happened again. I was having a rough time and not feeling too well. She used that to get me into her room again and I was never able to leave until we moved out of that house. Every night, I would sleep in her bed, and every day, I’d sit up at the computer until it was time for bed again. At this point, I’d graduated high school and wasn’t in college yet, so there was nowhere I could go anymore. I had to be with her 24/7. She’d beg me to lay in bed with her during the day because she was ‘scared’. I always refused. I knew if I did it once, she’d never let me get up again.

Before anyone asks, she never touched me or anything like that. Looking back, I think she was using me more like a stuffed animal you cuddle with when you’re scared. I was her security blanket of a sort. She even told me once that it was my ‘lot in life’ to take care of her and I just had to accept it. I was around twenty at that point, reading articles about how great it is to be that age and finally independent. I just wanted to cry my eyes out reading that.

I do want to ask, as I have said before that my mom was bipolar and a lot of her issues stemmed from that, including probably this, does any of this count as abuse? Am I justified in being angry about this? I’m never sure what to think because I always tell myself ‘well she just did it because she was scared. She never actually hurt you, she just wanted comfort.’

But then I think, this started when I was eleven years old. I was not equipped to be her emotional crutch at that age. I barely knew what was going on. That wasn’t right or fair to me.

It was to the point where, when she’d go to the psych ward (and that happened many many times) for a few days, I wouldn’t want her to come back. I’ve never admitted that to anyone, but I did not want her to come back. Because as soon as she did, everything started up again.

Oh, and when we moved out of our third house? We hotel-hopped for three years. We were always in the same room together for three years every single day.

At least I had my own bed.

EDIT: Just to quickly add, because it's come up in past posts, my mom is now dead and this is all in the past. None of it is currently happening.",JUSTNOMIL
"I put no advice wanted but if anyone has anything helpful to add it is always appreciated. I’m not sure how to link a post so you can check my post history, but the short version is LSP  came over to talk to kid#1 and left before we knew she even was there. DH wanted me to rugsweep everything and just let this go because she is “going through a hard time”. I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who commented and gave advice. I can’t tell you how much I appreciate it and how your words helped me get through to my husband. 

So after this happened DH and I were on pretty opposite pages. We had a pretty big argument and basically, I had to rehash everything that happened and what we went through for months because of his parents. I think bringing those feelings back up helped him have an “oh shit” moment and realize that his mom is only trying to manipulate him. I have been asking him to talk to them for months and set these boundaries, but when confronted with LSP directly asking to come over, he would make an excuse like we were busy or already had plans. 

He originally told me that I can say something to her but he didn’t want to. After the argument we were able to discuss things better and we decided on writing something to send to LSP from both of us to let her know what boundaries we wanted to set. This way she can’t twist our words to other people, and she can’t say she didn’t hear us say something (which is her go-to method). We set the boundaries we wanted to make and we did make some compromises, like we’re not completely cutting contact, but she can’t have unsupervised visits with them, she can’t bring FIL around them, and she can’t show up to our house uninvited. We could set up meetings in public places and take things from there. 

So we came up with what we needed to say and DH called her to tell her we were sending her a message. She asked about what and he told her about her just coming over our house without us knowing and other things that have been needing to be discussed. She tried to play it off and ask what he meant by that. He told her that kid#1 told us she came over. So of course she denied it and then he told her that he knows she’s lying and cousin also verified what kid#1 said. She backed down and said she would read it a little later. As soon as she read it she started blowing up our phones. We were in the car so DH texted her that he would call her later but we were in the car with the kids now. She replied “No this is something that needs to be discussed face to face not over the phone or text. I’ll come over tomorrow so we can talk about this”. Like this is literally one of the boundaries we set, you don’t decide when you come to our house we do. Ughhh. 

DH didn’t reply to her text, he wanted to have her come over to discuss everything the next day but I shut that down. I told him that there’s nothing to discuss, she wants to meet face to face because she wants to manipulate him into changing his mind and when that doesn’t happen she’s going to blow up. At first he thought I was being mean but I told him exactly what she would say and how it was all manipulation tactics. 

He ended up having a half day at work the next day so he called her. Immediately she started with the “I don’t understand where this is coming from”, “why are you doing this to me”, “FIL loves them too and he should be able to see them” etc. literally everything I said she would say. This set the lightbulb off that maybe I’m right and his mom is a manipulative asshole. Who knew? So he started to shut her down. He told her that there won’t be a discussion because there’s nothing  to discuss, what we said is what’s going to happen. Again she kept repeating where is this coming from and all that. 

Eventually when he could get a word in he said that we still haven’t forgiven them for what happened and that we’re doing this to protect our kids. So then the blow up started to happen. She flipped out and started cursing, blaming me because of course this is my fault, her own son would never do this to her. She said that I am miss perfect and never make mistakes, and that she can’t believe he married such a rude person. DH said that was his tipping point and he started yelling back that of course it’s both of our decision, he still can’t believe they did what they did, I’m a great wife and mother and she should be happy that he married someone like me, and basically shut all of her bull shit down. 

This pissed her off so she hung up and DH didn’t call her back again. He said they were on the phone for a while and she was just going in circles and switching back and forth between yelling and crying. DH has been pretty mopey since this all happened and he’s feeling guilty about it, but he’s also realized just how manipulative she can be. I keep reminding him that her feelings don’t come before our kids and that we’re doing what we need to do to protect them. He says he knows and he agrees but it still sucks having to do that to your parents, which I get. So anyway I feel an extinction burst coming pretty soon. I’m ordering cameras this weekend and we’re discussing our next steps in case she tries anything, because honestly this bitch is crazy and she comes up with half thought out schemes all the time. Wish me luck!",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi all. I’m still up with my best friend, chilling on her couch while I play some video games. I’ll be home soon, though. I’m not really looking forward to it. I miss my dad and Mr. Snuggles dearly, but... yeah.

I got my nips pierced, and I’m honestly kinda scared about going home. I’m going to be home alone with my mom and relative five days a week for eight hours (or whenever they decide to come home) while dad works and I’m scared they’re going to try shit with me while I’m sleeping or not paying attention. Relative has “joked” about slapping my boobs or hurting me when I’m home, and I’m kind of worried she’s being serious. She’s done shit like that before with sunburns, where she slaps you or scratches you and asks if it hurts. :( Dad says if that happens to beat the shit out of her (his exact words, also said, “put her ass in the ground”). However, I’m worried my mom won’t do anything if my relative tries anything like that. Like, I’m scared she’ll say, “Well, this wouldn’t have happened if you hadn’t gotten them pierced” or something, putting all the blame on me. I love my piercings and I think they’re one of the best decisions I’ve ever made, as I’m much more comfortable with my body now (also because I’m losing weight :D. went from size 31 to size 14 jeans!).

Anyways, I’ve explained my fears to my dad, and he said if my relative tries anything that I have full permission to ruin her life, and that if my mom does nothing about it, two people will be kicked out of the house (his name on the bills and lease). I’m worried to sleep with relative in the house because I kinda snitched on her.

Basically, she went out drinking with friends about a week ago, and drove home while under the influence, and admitted this all to me. My mom knew about it, too. Dad asked me if she drank that night and I was honest, he asked how she got home, and I told him. He confronted her about it (left me out) and she denied driving home but said something like, “I don’t appreciate whoever told you-“ but dad cut her off, saying, “Okay, this isn’t about them, this is about you.” The only people who could have told him are me and my mom. I think she knows it was me, but I’m not going to lie to my dad about it. She not only puts herself in danger while driving under the influence, but endangers other drivers that are on the road. You really think I want to cover that behavior up when somebody could get her to think reasonably and NOT drink and drive?

I’m worried because I feel that if she knows it’s me, she’ll try to get revenge by messing with my piercings somehow, either by hitting them, slapping them, or worse: trying to tug on them. If she does any of these, I will call the police for assault and press charges. I don’t care if it’s family. Assault is assault. However, I think she’d need to worry more about my dad than the cops if that were to happen. 

Maybe I’m overreacting, overthinking. However, due to her past with people having injuries and her odd... infatuation with slapping them, I don’t think I’m being unreasonable for thinking of these possibilities concerning her and my body. Considering her past, I think I’m being smart about it. Unfortunately, I can’t put a lock on my door, because my mom will more than likely think I’m doing drugs (because I have piercings, lol) or doing something illegal. Dad will probably say no and to stop being paranoid, but as I stated before... I think I’m being smart about thinking of the possibilities my future holds back home. That sounds pretty ominous, haha.

I say all of this about my relative because I honest to god feel like my mom would defend her in all of this. She has the belief that family is family and no matter what they do, you rugsweep and move on. I do not share that belief. I feel that she’ll blame it all on me and then argue with my dad about how he’s enabling me to act out and defile my body and shit.

I needed some more money while I was up here and my mom wasn’t happy and went on about how I need to be an adult and be responsible and get a job and license... Ma’am, I’m all the way up here. I cannot do any of that unless I move here, lol. Dad gave me the money but he wasn’t happy about it because my mom was being a bitch, and he chewed my mom out for saying all that stuff. Sorry that everything up here is so expensive. It’s not like I wanted to spend so much. I got things for myself (rarely do I ever shop for myself) and some groceries for the household I’m in and lunch for my friend and I. Shit is mad expensive. Funny, she didn’t say anything about my brother spending over $1000 on a smart watch. 🙄 Oh yeah, it was a gift for her. Why would she complain?

I’m rambling at this point. Sorry. I’m just worried about going home. Relative is moving out soon, but not soon enough, in my opinion. I just want it to be me, my parents, and Mr. Snuggles again. I miss my privacy (the tiny shred of it whenever my mom’s home). I miss not hearing frustrated rants every single day because people want to be disrespectful towards my dad. I just want it to be quiet. I want to rest.

Moving out isn’t quite an option yet. I have a place to go, but I need my license first and some money. Then I’ll be okay.",JUSTNOMIL
"So for context I am a 24 years old female(SG) and my brother is 39 years old(GC). He has a wife and 2 kids age 5 and 2, he lives in his MIL's house rent free and barely works enough hours to support his family ""because he doesnt want to work more hours."" Me and him have drifted apart due to him stealing money from me (its a long story.)  When he started having kids he kept trying to ask me to babysit for them, which I told him I would only do so if he paid me. He stated that he will pay me in the money he owes me (essentially he wanted to pay me little by little the money he stole from me, and then I would work for free.) which I refused. He told my mother this and this is where this damn problem started.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother at this point AT LEAST once a week tells my brother that she'll take care of the kids for a few hours. The reason why I say at least is because at some points we have the kids 3 or 4 days EACH WEEK.  However whenever she picks up the kids, she pretty much dumps them on me. From 6-10 hours each day I am forced to play games and watch both kids while my mom makes food, my grandmother watches tv in her room and my father watches the tv or sleeps the whole day. Our house isnt baby/child proof so I literally have to run after each kid to make sure they aren't getting into/ touching dangerous shit. Also I can not REPRIMAND OR PUNISH THE KIDS. Like say for an example  one of the kids broke a TV (which actually happened) I was screamed at for putting the kid into time out. TIME OUT. I will never beat a kid for punishment, I refuse to do such a thing, but what I try to do is time outs, and thats it. But nope these kids can break my things whenever they feel like it and I'm not allowed to say ANYTHING. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mother before each of these damn kids were even born, loved talking to my brother (while I was in the room) about how much she hopes his kids are nothing like me. Yet now that these kids are actually here and not inside their mother, my mother still doesn't want them anything like me, but she wants me to TEACH THEM all of my skills such as my singing and art skills. The real kicker here is **she doesnt tell me when she's bringing the kids over.**  Say I've been working on a school project thats worth 70% of my grade thats due in 2 days,  HA nope I'm forced to babysit. Got plans with friends? If she knows ahead of time she will make it on the days I have plans and she tells me ""oh you don't need friends. Just cancel and spend time with your nephews."" Am I working that day? **I have to call out to spend time with them.**  I was even sick at one point where I had a sinus infection and bacterial pink eye with my lungs filled with flem, I was forced to take care of these kids up until I got the pink eye because my mother didnt want me to infect them with pink eye. I got injured while working out a work out my family are forcing me to do), can barely walk due to said injury and the rest of my body sore from working out, nope gotta take care of them.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that had ticked me off the most is gifts for the kids and me. Every time the kids are over my mother buys them toys. Now the only reason why this bothers me is because this family can barely afford the bills we have and all of our spare money goes to toys for the kids or goes to my brother ""because he needs help with money."" What really fucking gets me in that all of my gifts over the past 5 years that wasnt clothing or gift cards, are all meant for the kids. For an example for YEARS I wanted a PS4 and never got it. in December of 2018 I finally got one and I was so happy until I turned on it on and saw the games. When I finally turned it on, all my mom could ever say was ""oh this is such a great way to bond with your nephews. You're going to have so much fun with your nephews."" When I saw the games I was even more livid, now don't get me wrong I love Sonic Mania and Spiderman (been watching playthroughs online) but my mother only got those game because my nephews likes Sonic and Spiderman. Right out of the gate 2 out of the 4 games for my PS4 were meant for my nephews instead. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I'm just at such a fucking breaking point that I honestly wish I could kill myself. There are a whole bunch of things going on with my family but this is the thing that is just boiling my blood the most. I am 24 years old and trying to finish my college degree, yet my mom just believes ""hey your brother had kids and you have to take care of them"" and no matter what I say, no matter if I'm calm, mad, in tears from pain and suffering, have school or work I have to take care of them. My mother is trying to make my life revolve around these kids and I honestly just cant stand it anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

TL, DR: My mother forces me to take care of my brother's kid and I am not allowed to say no or punish the kids if they do something wrong. Doesn't matter if I have college stuff, plans with friends, work, medically compromised or anything else, I am forced  leave behind everything just to take care of my brother's kids because he wants me to take care of them 1-4 days a week.",JUSTNOMIL
"Obligatory this happened earlier today so, a bit of back story. I live with my girlfriend and her mom in a 2 bedroom apartment. Some may think its weird, but I don't mind it. My girlfriend is also out of town at the moment for a few days so its just me and my girlfriends mom.
I came home from work today, took the dog out, took a shower, and played some videogames, as I have a very high stress job, and that's how I relieve some stress. That's pretty much the standard protocol for me. Well after a bit of time being home 3-4 hrs the dog started barking at something so I go to see what it is, and make sure the mom is OK, because she has some health problems, and upon leaving my room I'm greeted with ""Go the f**k back to your room I'm (insert age here) I can do what the f**k I want stop being nosey"". I went back to my room and texted my girlfriend and she said that her mom was ""uncomfortable from what happened last night"" and wouldn't say what did happen, so I decided that my best option was to stay in my room and not leave. (as a side note incidents similar to this have happened twice before) I've been in here for 3 hrs now. Now that's what confused me though because last night I got back from work helped the mom unload groceries, made some usual small talk, played some games and went to sleep, so now I'm just worried and stressed about the strain that this is putting on my relationship with my girlfriend, as well as the stress and distress this is causing me mentally not knowing what I did if anything and being worried for the fate of my relationship with a girl that I really really love.
TLDR: My girlfriends mom is mad at me because I don't know why and its causing me loads of stress and anxiety.
(UPDATE) MIL claimed that I was watching porn and standing outside of her bedroom door while her and her bf were banging, and she's uncomfortable that I'm here, and nearly called the cops on me last night because she thought I was up to something while I was in my room playing CSGO. I'm planing on packing my shit telling my gf I love her and going back to my parents house until I can get my shit situated.",JUSTNOMIL
"Shoot me. Lady B is coming to my city because she needs to get a) her wedding dress (for the wedding that is a month after mine), b) her dress for my wedding, and c) bridesmaid's dresses for me and her other two bridesmaids. She sprung it on me that she needed to stay with me for one night (tomorrow night) and like an idiot I followed my knee jerk reaction and said yes. FDH was not super happy but he said we could deal for one night. She called me a couple days ago to say that she hadn't found a hotel yet, which makes me think she's going to try to stay for more than one night.

&amp;#x200B;

She's got another think coming. FDH hates her anyway, but she didn't help matters when she asked whether the wedding rings were made of gold, and upon confirmation, said that was good because that meant they'd hold their resale value. She's made quite a few comments like that: she's been trying to manipulate me into not marrying him/telling me that we're going to get divorced/telling me that he's not mature enough. I've been ignoring them after I had words with her about it because honestly it's just not worth it to react to them? But he's v/pissed off. I have a bad habit of knee-jerk reacting to her expecting at me super hard but not this time. This time she's not paying my rent and she's got no actual control over me so the only repercussion would be her temper tantrum which, while exhausting to deal with, isn't anything like as stressful as being threatened with eviction through lack of rent money. Still. This is going to be exhausting. She's in town until Wednesday. I've made myself unavailable on Monday so at least I'll get a break.

&amp;#x200B;

Any tips on a) making sure you don't immediately react to buttons being pushed and b) how to enforce that one night boundary without expending a whole lot of energy?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: my suspicions were correct: she just called to let me know she was on her way (I was on speakerphone because it was her and her MOH+fam). I asked her where she was staying and she said ""we'll work that out tonight."" I asked her why she hadn't called one of the hotels I sent her and she was saying that she couldn't get them on the phone until her MOH cut in to say that she didn't even try. So she absolutely was planning to just not leave. Bitch has another think coming. I feel a bit sick right now to be honest: this is going to be a fight and a half.",JUSTNOMIL

Home state is currently flooding thanks to a huge amount of rainfall in a very short time frame.  It's also tornado season.  The local schools have issues cancelling classes, postponing/canceling final exams, etc.  During an inlaw family meetup, we were discussing how back in the 80s and 90s, we were told to take a heavy textbook, place it over the back of our heads and necks, and duck down in the hallway.  I suppose the thinking was it would protect us somewhat from flying debris?

Hathor chose this time to pipe up, ""That's exactly what we did for the holocaust!""

I gave her a confused look and asked her, laughing to myself, for clarification.   She sputtered and said that during storms, all the students would protect themselves with books from the holocaust.

"I told another Redditor that I will update on my situation. Last I wrote, I was dreading Christmas. Christmas was drama-filled as usual but lucky for us, we stayed at a different apartment than my JustnoMIL. She was very moody and didn't interact with me much. But according to my SILs, she kept asking them why I've been so distant from her. My SILs encouraged me to talk to my JustnoMIL to explain why I've been so upset with her.
Not long after Christmas, the reigning queen of toxicity (RQT for short), sent a stupid snail mail to my husband. She said how sad she was that we were distant and accused my husband of being a bad son and how she's a victim or what not because all she wants is to be a good mother and MIL. Bullshit. I was really annoyed by this so I wrote her a letter too. I started with thanking her and saying how I appreciated how generous and kind she was in the first four years of knowing her but then I wrote an essay about why I was distant. I explained all the shit she did that I wasn't okay with. At one point, I got really angry in the letter and I wrote 'shame on you'. I wrote it because my husband is an excellent son but she always puts him down and treat him like shit. She was due to visit our city so I asked my husband to give the letter to her. She asked if we wanted her to stay at our apartment or elsewhere because she would understand if we needed space (since I was pregnant at the time). My husband said, yes please, please stay somewhere else. Well guess what, she was pissed. Surprise surprise. During dinner, my husband give the RQT my letter (she wanted to see it, luckily I wasn't there). My husband also gave her a cheque to cover the expenses that she would need to stay at another apartment. (I know, what a sweetie). After she read my letter, she screamed at my husband at the restaurant and ripped his cheque up. She has been angry at me ever since. Not only did she not understand one word I told her because of her self-absorbed personality, she made up stories in her head. Stories like how my husband was the one telling lies about her so that I wouldn't like her anymore. 

Ok. Fast forward to the birth of my child. I decided not to tell anyone, including my own family, when I gave birth because I knew that I needed to recover and focus on learning how to become a mom to my baby. I decided to tell everyone when I arrived home so that I can brace myself for the thousands of messages that I needed to reply to. I needed energy for that. The only person that knew I gave birth was my mother because she came to take care of me for my recovery. The RQT was the first to find out in my husband's family after we arrived home but she was pissed that she wasn't the first to know. Then, we told her that we needed her to take the whooping cough vaccine before visiting us because the doctors and midwives told us that it was mandatory and that family members are the closest to the newborn so the risk of the baby being sick from family members are higher. Of course the RQT refused. Not because she was an anti-vaxxer, but because she was crazy. She thought we didn't want her to visit that's why we told her to get a vaccine done. I know, STUPID right? So she still hasn't gotten it.

Anyway, we scheduled a visit for her anyway and I had a mask prepared. She CANCELED. Saying oh, she wasn't up for it, she wasn't in the mood. Ok. The night of, she sent us a message telling us she would arrive the next morning at 10 am. We didn't see the message because we were asleep. My husband finally saw the message at 9 in the morning the next day. Since the baby kept us up all night, my hubby suggested that she came at 4pm instead on the same day. My father was also due to arrive the same morning so it'd be busy for us. Of course RQT ignored that messaged and showed up unannounced. She came in, ignored everyone (including my parents) and just kept saying, I need to see my baby, I need to see my son. I need to take a photo with my son. My son as in MY FUCKING CHILD. I had never been so afraid in my life. I thought she was going to kidnap my child at some point. She was so unstable.  She came and screamed at my husband when he asked her to have a sit and have a tea with us. She said, bravo, you make me suffer the most. Then she tossed my baby's gift onto the table left without her jacket. She came back in 15 minutes and demanded for a photo with my baby. But I knew if I didn't let her take a photo with him, she would start screaming and it would scare my baby. She stayed for 5 minutes max and then left again without saying goodbye to everyone. The whole time she was there, she treated me as if I wasn't there. 

So my husband eventually called her out on it and told her that she better be zen the next time she visited. 

She did end up visiting again but with her sister next. I love this aunt because she is on our side. She doesn't want to get involved but she knew that it would help if she were to act as a buffer. My RQT behaved. She tried to provoke us by questioning our parenting skills but we just ignored her.
She went on a trip and came back and demanded to see our baby. This was a week after the visit with the aunt. We said no because we had a hectic week and we were tired and really needed the weekend to rest. She said ok, she will give me two days to recover and will arrive two days later. By the time we saw this message, it was the next morning and guess what, she came unannounced again. My husband told her that it's not acceptable. She then threatened to sue us for visitation rights. By then, I was shaking and crying. I didn't want to give her my baby to hold. But my husband thought that she would leave quicker if we gave her the baby. WRONG. I came out of the bedroom after crying and she was like is there a problem? I said yes, you didn't respect our wishes. Then she yelled at me, SHUT UP SHUT UP, while holding my baby. I said it wasn't okay that she was behaving this way. SHe then told my husband that his wife wasn't normal. My husband replied, no YOU'RE the one that's not normal. Then she started saying shit about us to my son, about how we're shitty parents. I then decided to film her crazy ass shit in case we need to use it in court. She behaved a bit after she knew I was filming her. My husband got into a fight with her because of her shitty behaviour. He also wrote in whatsapp to her and called her our on her toxicity and her abusive behaviour and that he will no longer tolerate her abuse towards his wife and son. She said she had nothing to say to this of course. She didn't acknowledge one thing she did. 

Not long after this, I made an appointment with a lawyer to know my rights here in this country and what to do. She suggested that we give her a 'shock', that is not to open the door when she shows up unannounced and also kick her out if she misbehaves. She told us to write to her first to let her know our boundaries. 

Anyway, she's due to visit again in June. (I know, you're all wondering why we have to bother with this crazy bitch.) In the country I live in, the children have rights to maintain a relationship with their grandparents. That means that we cannot forbid our child to see her. But we can give our boundaries and say no when it's absolutely necessary. My lawyer said that all of our whatsapp messages can be admissible in court. 

Anyway,that's that. Rant over. 

Sigh. Now I just need to keep functioning even though I'm sleep deprived. I need to focus on my baby. Ciao all. Thanks for listening.",JUSTNOMIL
"I appreciated all of the comments on my last post. They really pushed me to contact some local crisis outreach teams in my area. However, unfortunately as dad is seen as mentally sound and isn’t “old enough” to classify under elder abuse- the most I could do was send the police for a wellness check. Wanting that to be a last resort I tried to make plans to see him alone- and he bailed. He bailed the next day on female family member as well- but very vague as to why. 

I’ve reflected a lot in the past day or two and today after having a good talk with female family member it’s become incredibly apparent that my dad is 100% the enabler of WW’s behaviour.

He rugsweeps like none other- in a conversation with family he just shrugged off saying that “it wasn’t so bad” that she took his phone at night and midnight called family and sent text messages impersonating him.  He showed up at family members place of work to “ show her he’s still alive”. Obviously WW has caught wind of our concerns and is now more interested in saving face.

I reached out to ask him to do coffee with me and his response was “ I need some time- maybe in a few weeks”

It was definitely him texting- not her.  

I’m just sad I suppose. At this point, he is not the parent I deserve. He won’t stand up to her for me, his kid, and hasn’t in the past 10 years. I’m just done with the scenario. If he wants to continue to cling to her for dear life- that’s his choice and he has quite obviously made it.

I’m mourning that the amazing, great relationship we once had will never be the same. Even if he left her tomorrow I think that too much damage has been done to our relationship to ever be as close as we once were.  DH and I want to start trying to produce little minions soon and I’m sad that in order to protect them- he will never be able to have a relationship with them. 

On the bright side of things- it makes me so much more great ful for the extra parents I have. My stepdad is greater than great can be and we have really started connecting these last few years and he is super sweet with my niece. My FIL is also absolutely amazing and would bend over backwards for us and future minions and I adore hanging out with him.

It’s going to be an interesting time sorting out if this is LC, NC or if he even feigns to reach out ever. I know he likely will when WW goes on vacation without him- but I know he lies to her about where he is and frankly- I’m not interested in being a part of his lies to her- it only stokes her hellfire of hate towards me further.

Thanks for listening to my rambles- I likely won’t have any updates for a while ( or so I hope)",JUSTNOMIL
"Gah! MIL just visited and now this lady is trying to make me think I’m crazy.

I’ve been trying to give this lady the benefit of the doubt and invite her to see the grandbaby in small time allotments at least weekly. DD is 1 month old. 

If you read through my post history you can see the whole gamut of grievances she gave me during pregnancy, but basically it boils down to: she moved to town, has a whole room named “DD’s room” in her house, which we have yet to use, and basically acted like she was going to be a second mom to my daughter the whole pregnancy, with some power plays sprinkled in there too. Also she’s very codependent to my husbands alcoholic father, which is yet another reason why I’m limiting visits to small increments of time at my house. After 1 month I unfortunately have to say, it’s not really that much better. 

Last week she came over to watch the baby while I ran errands. I gave her 3 instructions and she followed exactly 0 of them. It wasn’t that big of a deal, but still like... annoying. 

When I got back she stayed and chatted. Things are obviously strained during our chat. I mention plans for this Sunday to celebrate DHs birthday where we will drive about 1.5 hours to the big city where my parents live to see a concert. I told her this so that she doesn’t make plans for DH on that day, and I didn’t think much else of it. 

This week she comes over to deliver some food she made which I did not ask her for and contains cabbage (which I told her dries up a mother’s milk supply). It was obviously a ploy to come see the baby but, I haven’t had her over this week so, I said OK.  We chat again: 

MIL: so what time are you dropping off DD on Sunday
Me: uh, we are going to City this weekend
MIL: yeah last week you asked me to watch her
Me: oh uh, I don’t think I did, I need to have her with me, she’s my little pump
MIL:  *recounting what I said last week* you said because visitors weren’t coming in town, you were going to City, you asked me to watch her
Me:  sorry you thought I was asking and you got excited, I didn’t mean to do that
*silence for 2 very long minutes, then changes the subject*

I’ve told this lady numerous times that there “won’t be overnight visits for a very long time”. She can’t possibly really think I was asking, by telling her our plans,  right? I’m the type of person that specifically outright asks for something I need. But the words “will you watch DD never left my mouth. If I had really intended to leave my daughter with her I’d have like made arrangements for drop off/pick up and like all the crap a newborn needs (diapers, food, etc), I’m that Type A kind of person. I would never just casually mention plans to someone then expect them to watch my newborn daughter. 

I think it was just an attempt to make me think I’m crazy, and then guilt me in to letting her watch my daughter more. 

Haven’t talked to DH yet. It may be my sleep deprived brain but, I think I warned him last week that I had a feeling this was going to happen. If it wasn’t about this, it was about something else because MIL does this shit all the time- make plans without really making plans. 

He really wants me to be fair to her, which I have been. But now that there is a guilt trip impending, I feel like “fair” is going to swing to “don’t hurt her feelings”. So I’m trying to prepare to show him that she can’t just make assumptions, get her “feelings hurt” and then force us into doing what she wants (cause that’s a guilt trip working out for imposing party). His family has operated this way for so many years that it’s pretty much engrained in him, until I point it out. 

Ok rant over. Tips on showing hubby how this is a guilt trip? Tips on handling MIL? Ways to avoid this next time? I suppose other than specifically saying “we don’t need child care, after every time I mention we have plans” 

At the end of the day, my kid isn’t staying there. She’s one month old and she needs me, and I need her. Also, Alcoholic in the house. MIL can’t follow 3 simple instructions. Yeah, just, no. And probably not for a very long time.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi! So this is actually about my own mother. My brother and his girlfriend have a beautiful baby daughter (only a few months old), who i just love very much.

My mom has been doing some babysitting and since I live at home I've been helping out too. My brother and his gf have been using reusable diapers instead of the normal ones. These diapers are a bit harder to put on than the normal ones, but not too hard to handle when you get the hang of it. 

Wednesday, during babysitting, my mom put the diaper on wrong and it resulted in me getting pooped under. No biggie for me, that's part of being an aunt right? Well after that accident we used an extra diaper and eventually we were short on diapers. My brother stopped by for a second and offered to get another one of those diapers, but my mom told him she would just get another pack of normal diapers from the store. 

Anyway after that my mom went on about how normal diapers are better and whatnot and she would've chosen normal diapers over the reusable ones. My brother told her it's not her choice to make so she should just stick to the reusable ones.

Later my brothers gf later came to pick her baby up. So ofcourse the subject of the other diaper came up. My mom said after explaining why she had a different diaper on ""well I will just give her the normal diapers when she's here"". After that I asked my brothers gf why she chose for the reusable ones, just so my mom would hear that too. 

My brother later told me his gf was kind of mad afterwards and said she wouldn't bring her daughter to my mother if this kind of behavior would go on.

How fast would you stop bringing your child to your mother in law? What kind if thing would stop you from bringing her? I need to know so my niece will still come to our house.

I really want my niece to keep coming to us, I already told my mom to just listen to my brother and his gf.",JUSTNOMIL
So my fabulous younger son's graduation is tonight-and his fiancee and his family are coming.  Justnotkaren threw a FIT-saying 'well I a coming and I dont want them there-its a SIN'. I reminded her she disowned all of us and isnt wanted there. I cant stop her from coming because our town is so small graduation is a public open event! THEN she had the nerve to get pissed I refused to watch my nieces so she dont have to bring them-because HER husband isnt allowed on school property. How do I handle this? Can i ask the principal to stop her from entering due to her behavior? BTW-the entire school supports my son and his fiancee-they think a gay couple is  'neat' LOL,JUSTNOMIL
"Biomom crossed a major line. 

I have a pernicious eating disorder and have struggled with body dysmorphia and on again off again major depression as a result since puberty. 

It may be my most deep seated issue and my fiancé isn’t at all unfamiliar at this point with my waking him up in the middle of night sobbing making him promise he’s actually attracted to me and not planning on leaving. 

He’s been so sweet and empathetic and patient and understanding. It’s truly a dream. He is my knight in shining armor. 

The doctor cautiously approved him to return to work, the plan being two hours a day for two days, then four hours a day for a couple days, etc. 

But he’s in a very cutthroat industry so the powers that be decided this clearance was good enough to use to send him on an out of state business trip. 

I was mad they were making him push his recovery so fast, but it’s not an uncommon sort of situation at all. 

He left very early in the morning for the trip. I slept and woke up to find a letter in the kitchen that, to summarize, read 

*-I’m not really on a business trip.* 

*I’m breaking off the engagement because I cannot be attracted to you at this weight. I love you as a friend but don’t want to commit to living an unfulfilling life. I thought I could love who were enough to get past what you look like but I’m not strong enough. Please forgive me.* 

*To make this as easy as possibly on both of us, I think it would be best if we don’t see each other for a while.* 

*Take these next couple days to pack your things and make living arrangements. Please respect my wishes and be gone before I return.* 

The really odd thing is he capped it all off with “I’ll always have a special place in my heart for our time together [distinct pet name].” It was not his writing style at all. 

Another red flag is letter was typed. He hates typing. He would never type a letter he could’ve at all possibly written by hand. 

Second, as mentioned, it was not his speaking style. It was very prosaic and factual and had a lot of precise instructions. 

Third, the night before he’d spent wedding planning and bitching about how I don’t ever buy enough boxes of pizza bagels when I go shopping. 

Nothing that signaled “emotional crisis leading to end of engagement.” 

But I didn’t write it off right away because 1, *it was inside my house.* And two, he only ever uses that pet name in private. It’s got a very intimate, personal meaning. 

So I just photographed it exactly as I found it and sent it to him and said “This was in the kitchen when I woke up. Explain.” 

Basically we figured out that biomom wrote the note and that somehow she’s obtained a copy of our house key. 

There was no plausible way for fiancé to leave this trip early so he arranged for me to go out there immediately. I’m here now. Seething and shuddering at her being in our house and what else she might’ve done in there. 

Stepmom and dad are very nicely getting our locks changed and reinforced for us while we’re away. 

Fiancé let biomom know her trick didn’t work and she is no longer welcome in any of our homes. (I can hear how many are probably thinking *go no contact* and I’m right there with you but for many reasons it’s just not a plausible option at this point in time.) 

Even though he didn’t write this letter or have anything to do with it at all it’s stirred up a lot of dormant insecurities and fears that I am now having to experience and fiancé is having to help cope with while busy on a job site and recovering from emergency surgery. 

I can’t believe the nerve of this woman. Fiancé called the cops so there’s a record of her breaking and entering at least but no neighboring cameras got her and we can’t prove she was inside the house so the police can’t charger her or anything. 

Does anyone have any other tips for keeping her out of our personal lives or any other ways she might’ve invaded our privacy that I’m not anticipating? 

I have no idea how she got a copy of our house key and neither does fiancé, who took the initiative to be sure all our keys were accounted for when he threw her out and banned overnights a while ago. 

We also figure she picked up my pet name by eavesdropping when we had no idea she was anywhere around. So, yah. That’s concerning. 

I don’t need any more surprises of this nature and if there’s anything else I should watch out for, besides a murder charge if I see her too soon, please let me know. Thank you very much in advance! 

*tl;dr Biomom broke into our house when my fiancé was away and left a forged engagement call off letter for me to find in our kitchen. She is no longer welcome in our or stepmom’s homes and can only see us when she is one many invited guests to a public function.*",JUSTNOMIL
"Gentle advice needed trigger warning

I’m afraid my mother is a justno. Since I have found this place and read some of other stories about justno moms and MIL, I’ve noticed that my mom exhibits a lot of the narcissistic self centered tendency as other justno moms. For a long time I new that my moms behavior is isn’t like normal mothers. Her are a few of the things of the top of my head.

I remember making her a Mother’s Day card and giving it to her while she was on the phone. She only looked at it and proceeded to talk on the phone. No thanks or anything. I was only 4 or 5 when this happened

She yells a lot for me to do things that she can do herself like to get her food or help find her phone or the remote. She wants me to cook for her and to do as she says.

She is a very my word is law lady. If she tells you to do something you do it, even when you don’t want to. I often just go with it because I know that no matter how much reasoning and logic I try to use she just ignores it and tells me to shut up and just do it.

She has no boundaries in the house. She doesn’t close the door when she uses the bathroom. ( this is more like something that bothers me since I have asked her multiple times to close the door when she’s in there)

She is irresponsible. One example of this is she got a new puppy and she’s cute as hell, but she doesn’t take care of her and has me do it for her. ( to be fair she does pay me $20 bucks a week to do it but her payments have been late and she owes me $120 now). She also didn’t get her vaccinated until she about 4 months after she got her and now she has some might problem that I have to take care of. She doesn’t schedule appointments for the dog and I have to remind her daily to do it. Which she gets mad for but I only do it because she puts it off or forgets. The appointments she does set up she misses. She expects me to wake her up for my game days. Now this may me just being petty but if you are going to FORCE ME TO PLAY WHEN I DONT WANT TO on A TEAM THAT ARGUES WITH EACH OTHER WHILE PLAYING don’t expect me to be jumping out of bed to go play with them. I have expressed how I don’t want to be on that team and want to be on a old team that has people I get along with and is better but she refused to let me even though I’m sure they would Take me with open arms. Her excuse was she didn’t have time to drive me to the games. The team I want to be on is in a city 30 mins. away which I now know is bullshit because she had time to do it when I was younger so why not now. I could also drive myself since I’ll be driving soon.

She puts on a mask in front of people being kind but at home is inconsiderate and loud and rude. Seeking admiration and approval from people she bearly knows.
 
She doesn’t take her children’s or husbands feelings into account and often makes decisions for us without telling us first. For me and my siblings it’s sports for my dad it’s dogs. She didn’t tell him about the dog until she brought her home.

My mother has also made me cry as a child and slapped me before. The slap was for calling her a bitch because she was bitching about to me to give back the scissors I borrowed from her. The making me cry is for not doing good in my sport. She is very set on making me play sports even though I don’t really want to and if I do play I want to do it because I want to not her. I have repeatedly told her I don’t want to play college ball even if I am offered a scholarship. We aren’t poor I know that with all of the expensive unnecessary Louis Voulton bags she buys, so she can afford to send me t college.

This morning I was talking to my niece who is 5 on our way to school and I noticed her breath smelled bad. So asked her if brushed her teeth to which she says no and when I try to tell her that she has to brush her teeth twice a day like a good aunt my mom tells me to be quiet. I tried to remind my niece again to which my mom interrupt with this: SHUT UP OP. HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

That right their is what made me realize how she has narcissistic tendencies,very often. I realized today that I have some of her problems as well. That I can get into peoples personal space sometimes and not thing much of it, not take someone’s feelings into regard, or being demanding mostly with my Bros. I’m not sure if it because I’m a teen that I think this way or heredity, but I’m afraid of becoming like her and I can’t open up to her or my dad about it because she refuses to acknowledge that she is at fault or has something wrong with her. I would sadly say that my dad is an enabler somewhat he does defend me when her behavior gets bad, but let’s her smaller things slide because he knows that he can’t get through to her. How do I keep myself from becoming like my mom, I still have a couple years until college so my only plan is to go through the motions until I leave and get therapy after to help me get rid of any justno tendencies I may/most likely have. I would really like advice from anyone who is willing to offer.",JUSTNOMIL
"Rant, advice needed. 
Long time lurker, first time poster. My boyfriend and I have been together for about a year. I love his mum and she loves me. However, his mum has always seemed a bit off, but I could never put my finger on it... Until tonight.

This morning I leave the house with a white skivy on under a green dress. My MIL bought me this dress and has the same. Red flag #1.
When I get home my MIL is wearing an identical outfit. Red flag #2.
A few hours later she's had a few scotches (read: many) and starts joking about how she knows how much me and my boyfriend bang. A little bit awkward, but moving on. An hour later she turns to my boyfriend and says ""how do you feel that I'm dressed like your girlfriend, especially since you have sex with her so much"".

Thanks for listening reddit, I expect you'll hear more from me.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the responses. Who knew all I needed to get traction on reddit was for my MIL to want to do my boyfriend. For those asking, neither of us commented when she made this statement. When she drinks she talks a lot and that's not an uncommon response. Once she went to bed I pointed out to my boyfriend how I interpreted her comment and to say he was disgusted is an understatement.

BF = boyfriend FMIL = future mother in law

&amp;#x200B;

My FMIL texted my boyfriend asking when he would be free next week to meet up and my BF replied that he doesn't want to yet as feelings are still hurt but maybe in the Summer holidays. She texted him back and said that she will be very sad not to see him.

She used to ask when she could see both of us but I noticed she only asked when she could see him and that along with comments on my original post made me realise that this isn't just someone in grief, this is someone who is actively showing they don't want me around and I am completely in agreement with my BF to cut contact un till she treats us and the relationship with respect so my BF chose not respond. This was the night time of BF's dad's birthday, today is the next day, I go onto Facebook and see a status from FMIL from a few minutes after the texts with my BF:

[https://imgur.com/k4SYmqm](https://imgur.com/k4SYmqm)

I interpret that to mean that life is shit for her and it seems to be linked with my BF, she posted this on her husbands birthday so obviously the comments where worried about her and what could of happened. This seems to be a thing that happens a lot, she posts how upset she is and an influx of comments about how amazing she is will pour in and she will post about her mum and there will be lots of comments about how it wasn't her fault but this behaviour is not something I am used to, is this a way to deal with grief? 

She doesn't know that I am aware about what she has said or felt about me and she also doesn't know that we have gone no contact and I'm getting worried. I don't know if we should tell her, I don't know if we just ignore her or I don't know if this is now a bad idea. If my BF's mum is really feeling this awful are we the bad ones for not giving in? I can't help but feel responsible and my BF feels bad too, he obviously cares for her and I care by extension of my BF but I feel like we made progress and now we're back peddling and now we're both stuck feeling guilt.

"So, I have been with my husband 11 years and married for 7 years. My MIL has always been a major source of contention in our relationship and a huge thorn in my side. But I always thought, “I’m marrying him, not his mom” and boyyyy was I ever wrong. 

If I am to start at the beginning of time, and I feel like I should just so everyone has a bit of backstory to understand that I just don’t hate her for no reason...  the first issue I ever had with her was that she was still taking his ex (let’s call her X) out to concerts and little excursions when she never did any of those things with me. (This was after we were engaged and had moved in together). When I finally got up the courage to confront her about it her reasoning was that she “didn’t know me like she knew X. And that X had lived with her for a period of time and she had washed her underwear.” Which I thought was weird but like, okay. Whatever. 

Fast forward, and I’m planning our bridal shower and wedding... both of which at her request I changed the dates because of her reasons... and then along cane baby and she requested I change the date of the baby shower. And also basically every single event I have planned since then. She even requested I change my daughters birthday party because “as you know we are always out of town that weekend.” (Her birthday is Labor Day weekend.) 

She also calls and expects me to do her hair on demand, work around her schedule (I’m in school finishing my bachelors degree, a part time hair dresser, and homemaker- legit do not have time for that business) 

And the two most damning things happened most recently. 

She booked a trip with my daughter to Florida for a week without my permission or my husbands permission, to Disney. “Oh by the way I’m taking M to Florida the first week of July.” Whut? Who said? She’s 5 and not your kid... she’s my kid. And she knew that I had already planned a Disney trip in December, but she decided that she had time off work so, ya know, whatever! 

Second- my husband will occasionally post cute things on MY Facebook and she comments back, “well thank you son!” Weird, some kind of strange attachment complex going on with her and him. 

He literally cannot say no to her, has no inkling of how to set boundaries with her, and I am the one left cleaning up the messes. I mean, there’s a ton more but I figured I’d introduce trainwreck to you guys being new and all.",JUSTNOMIL
"I thought I might feel liberated but I am sitting here a nervous wreck. I feel like ive gown through the stages of grief after just sending it. Anger denial bargaining but I also feel guilt. 

I keep fucking worrying about her and my dads damn feelings and I don’t know why. My letter was honest and open about how deeply I am hurt and staying that’s why I want low contact. 

They are actually visiting the step brother I told them I never want to speak to again right now. 

In the letter I told them they are blocked and to think verrrry carefully about their reply as it would have “lifelong ramnifications” and that I “cannot endure any stress during this pregnancy” very dramatic but I guess I felt I needed that. 

I also told them my husband and therapist would be filtering all emails. That should scare the shit out of them. I blocked them on iPhone, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram too. I disconnected my email from my phone so I can check it when ready. 

I am a anxious nervous wreck but better than If they were not blocked.
My husband took me for Chinese food right after I sent it cause it’s my fav. We then drove around and looked At houses cause we wanna move. I woke up at 3 am in panic and checked my phone thinking maybe they found some way to contact me, no messages and I calmed down. It doesn’t seem normal to be this afraid of my own parents. 

I went through extreme anger towards them to then guilt and awkward feelings. 

I just want peace. I don’t really wanna face them or their reaction or their email. I guess somehow I learnt in my family my feelings don’t matter and showing my “feelings” is the most awkward and uncomfortable thing I’ve ever done!!! I was always the happy conciencious daughter. 

I just have no clue how they’re gonna react. Anger? Pretend sympathy and caring? Hurt? Send me a huge long fake apology? And also how will each reaction make me feel? If their react poorly it might make it easier on me. Im actually scared of them trying to be nice.

"I’m pregnant! About 5-6 weeks along with my first doctor’s appointment next week to verify things are going as they should.

I’ve been in peaceful NC with Mess since the last time I went to her hoard AKA my childhood home. I have no problem shutting her down *hard* if need be. Once you earn my low opinion, you get it for life.

My problem is my MIL. She already suspects because we talked about names then I puked 2 weeks later. Can I just find names interesting like always?

I like my husband’s family most of the time (minus the odd SIL3 tantrum) but MIL has some mildly no tendencies. Hubs admits she’s rubbish at understanding other’s emotions or seeing from another person’s POV. It’s why she still asks if we’ve spoken to Mess occasionally. The bitch went around my wedding bring a miserable cankle speculating on when my marriage would fail but somehow that doesn’t register. 

MIL is empathizing with Mess as a mother forgetting what kind of person Mess is. And MIL knows enough about Mess’s actions that she shouldn’t be asking stupid questions about if and when I’ve talked to her. I’m over these questions but IDK if Hubs actually told her to stop asking me but it’s been a while.

Hubs and I are waiting to tell his immediate family my eggo is preggo until we’re out of the proverbial woods in July. I’m figuring the fifth thing out of MIL’s mouth will be about me fixing my relationship with Mess. Never mind that Mess broke it and is the reason it has stayed broken. I’m working on a prepared statement to hopefully end this 

&gt;My mother was and is an abusive and toxic person. She is manipulative, vindictive, petty, and selfish. She has tried to damage my relationship with your family several times over the years. She has done nothing to deal with that part of yourself and will happily be that version of herself to me, your son, and your future grandchild. 

&gt;You don’t know that side of her but it’s all I’ve known since 2016. The more you empathize with my abuser, the more destructive it is for *our* relationship. My relationship with my abuser should never be your concern, especially if you want us to have a good relationship.

&gt;I have told my mother to get professional help several times. That is the only condition I have laid down to have a relationship. If she cannot do that, she will not know her grandchild. This is the only time I plan on addressing this issue. You are not to tell her anything about our lives or my pregnancy. If you do, you will receive radio silence from the both of us for 2 weeks. These are the choices I’m making to protect my family and I need you to respect them.

I want to maintain a decent relationship with these people because they’re not bad, just clueless and dense that all families aren’t like theirs. They’re also my only real support network since my extended family isn’t worth much. Anyone who says ‘NC’ will be downvoted and ignored.

"TLDR at bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want note some stuff that shes has said before. Then Ill get to what happened about a week ago.

My boyfriend is filipino.My bf also has anger issues which he's learned to control but has trouble sometimes. His relationship with his mother isnt good ( this is important ) Were about a year into our relationship and his mother has had problems with me from our very first date. Me and bf used to work together at a local 7-11. He didnt have a car at the time and his mother usually picked him up from work. This extended to our first date and a couple of others until he bought a car.

After our first date when my bf got back into the car with his mom she told him that I wasnt pretty enough for him, that when I went to college I would cheat on him and that I was fat. I was hurt because I didnt know why she would say these things. I thought I gave a vibe off and well i am chubby but damn \*ouch\*  Anyway my bf doesnt have a good relationship with his mother. This is because when he was born she consistently left him with family that he barely knew in the filipines( he eventually got to know his family but at the time he would describe it as "" one day my mom was there the next she was gone for 2 weeks and I was with a random ""aunt"" "" .She would disappear and when he was 3 or 5 he made a present for her. A picture with a frame with glued on pasta noodles. She took it and said : ""what the hell am i soppoused to do with this"". To go on my bf and I eventually moved in together while I was in college . We had already discussed how we would want things to go when we moved in. Basically I would do everything and he just had to take the trash out, clean the dishes and sweep the floor and we would take turns cooking . Thats it!    

Well before she moved out I was consistently asked and nagged about why I wasnt cooking every day . Why I didnt just do the dishes and Why I didnt take the trash out. I always explained to her what the situation was but she always sighed and said I should just do it now. When bf tried to explain things to her she said that because im the girl I should be doing all of it and if he had just gotten a filipina girlfriend then she would do all of no questions asked.   At another point my SIL husband came by the house. Hes nice and is talking to my MIL. My mother told me to never interrupt people who are talking. Since they were talking I smiled at them as I passed by the kitchen table. When he left my MIL was annoyed that I didnt say. Hello to them when I walked in . I said I didnt want to interrupt them. She tells me I need to have proper manners. \*ouch\* I dont like spicy food . (yeah im latina but my dads name is greg and hes whiter that mayonnaise so idk) She bought some spicy salsa and wanted me to eat it. i say no that bf will enjoy it more. When bf comes home from work she says in tagalog \[native language\] what type of mexican doesnt like spicy.  If I wore makeup while he was at work she would give me a snide eye an would ask if I was going on date.         

Mind you when I lived with my mom I wore makeup everyday. Because of my MIL I now only wear makeup when I want to cheer myself up , am going out with my family or when bf is home . If I wore jeans, a crop top or just looked presentable she would give me the same look and ask if I was going on a date.   Now I just mostly stay in my pajamas.  Now I had a class in building in front of where we lived . And I would go in at 6 and come out at 8.  MIL would always tell bf that I was cheating on him and that the building was closed after 6 (bf later admits that he almost came to believe his mom but eventually realized that I did have a class there)  

Now she didnt like that I was Mexican. She always wanted her son to be with a filipina or a white person.  I met bf grandparents through fb video call they were sweet. Grandpa looks at me says he is happy im not as fat as he was told. \*ouch\* Now to add my bf was primarly raised by his sister who while raising him put her self through college. Admirable for sure! However shes now a stay at home mom who doesnt work or clean. She mostly volunteers at her daughters school. When I met his sister she was friendly but that was about it. I got the vibe she didnt like me or that she just didnt care about me.When she moved out she came by to pick some boxes up . When she saw me she said i didnt look so fat anymore and that I didnt have a stomach anymore. I kind of smiled and said thanks. \*Just to note ive never given her sass or stood up for myself because I never wanted to be rude\* Later that night when bf comes home I tell him that MIL was here I metion her comment and hes grown quite tired of just hearing about her. He basically sends her a bunch of messages calling her out and telling her to not talk to us again.  

 She then texts me and says I make everything difficult that her son hates her because of me that shes taught her soon good and what not.    Now to add I wasnt really bothered by the comment. When I mentioned it to bf I mentioned just because. I didnt know that it would upset him so much. He texts her back saying he thought it was impolite and that what about everything that she has about me.She yells at me to never talk to her again and that ive ruined her life. 

TLDR; MIL has made various racist comments about me and my weight. And blames me for the strained relationship of her and son. Meanwhile Ive never even thrown a sassy comment her way just because I dont want to cause a scene.",JUSTNOMIL
"Trigger warning: Disturbing tragedy and death

It's been a year, and as that is the case I am aware there have been some rule changes since I've last peeked at this sub. I have reread the rules to ensure I am doing my best to follow them, but if I have failed please kindly let me know and I will repost, edit, or whatever is necessary. I've tried my best to find a flair that I think fits, but if there is something else I haven't seen because I have the eyes of a mole I will change it.

Straight to the point, GlassCow, my MIL, passed away many months ago. It was not appropriate at the time to post about it. In fact, I don't think it even occurred to me as I haven't been on Reddit in a long, long while. My DW had a hard time for a while, but things have gotten better. A lot better, actually. 

As to how she died, that's what the trigger warning's for. If you don't want to know skip this next paragraph.

Now, if you travel along BitchBot's link journey or are familiar with my MIL, you will recall that she was a hoarder. Not of garbage or useless tat (in the general and assorted sense, anyway) but in glass figurines and items stacked in box after box until her home looked like a carpeted warehouse with cardboard walls. After we cut her out of our lives, the hoarding got worse. Windows and doors, the few important ones left unhindered were beginning to be filled. Another window didn't go, luckily, but they were covered nonetheless. Boxes were even shoved on top of her stove when she was found, a place she'd avoided before. Then there came a day when the boxes fell inward, but sadly not on top of her. I say sadly not because I wanted her to die, but because they blocked the remaining door instead. And she died, trapped in her house, with no longer quick access to her phone, any exits, or anyone left who would want to check on her out of love or worry, of starvation. This isn't how any of us wanted things to happen. It's not how things should have gone at all. In a long winding journey, it was debated as to whether or not DW, my BIL (her brother), and SIL (his wife) should be charged with elder neglect, but this was ultimately dropped one by one starting with my wife and ending with her brother. It was decided that she had given evidence of not being senile, had been offered the help obligated, and it was of her own volition that the hoard grew to that dangerous point. Even then, sometimes I feel maybe the police or a social worker should have gotten more involved, but they've both been contacted multiple times. 

Now, on a lighter note, some BEC from my mother.

As you might also recall or read in my history, my mother's a little donate happy but with *our* things. So now when she gives us gifts, we have a special box we put it in to donate since it's such a big deal. 

Thank you so much for reading this, and I hope you read something happier today.

TLDR; My MIL has died and my mother's gifts now get donated since she nags about us donating.",JUSTNOMIL
"My MIL (and lots of other family) are arriving today for my teen's graduation. We are hosting dinner tonight at 5pm. My MIL has been asking for months to come early to ""help"". Unfortunately, her idea of helping is... the opposite of helpful. She has tried various ways to sneak into coming early, so I texted her yesterday ""See you tomorrow at 5"". She tried one more time to ask if I needed her there earlier to help and I said that we would not be home earlier.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I  tell her when she shows up at my door early? I have severe social anxiety and I have to deal with her for three days, so it needs to be firm but super polite.

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking of saying ""Nice to see you. I'm heading out right now, see you at 5"" but that forces me to run out the door when she shows up and I may have stuff in the oven.

&amp;#x200B;

Do all y'all have any suggestions?

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\* UPDATE \*\*\*

YOU GUYS ROCK

I sent her a polite reminder email, ""Can't wait to see you at 5"" and then turned up the music and locked the front door. :-) She tried one more time over text and I politely shot her down again.

&amp;#x200B;

I have to run to the store and then I am getting into the shower... so there is no way she can show up early now.  :-)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to use some of your other advice for tomorrow, too. I need her not to show up until the BBQ so I am going to use my BIL to do a combination of wrangling her and sending her off on a wild goose chase. I'm sure I can think of a list of things that I will conveniently remember I need \*just\* as she almost gets here. Lol.",JUSTNOMIL
"I posted this to legal advice and they removed it pretty much immediately. For the last several months my mother has been progressively more unhinged, and picks fights constantly. She and I have never gotten along. Last month my boyfriend and I had a fight and he moved out, causing me to be unable to pay this months rent. All month she’s been more and more verbally abusive and angry over that, and tells me to get out every single day. We have nowhere else to go, so I told her that when she filed an eviction notice we would leave. She thought that was out of spite, when it is truly out of necessity. 

Last night she picked a fight specifically to cause a reaction in me, and when I didn’t bite, she left the house. 20 minutes later, the cops showed up and said that apparently I had thrown juice at her (she grabbed my hand while I was holding it) and that I stole her phone. None of that happened, which I told the police, and the cops left. Today I spent watching the kids and cleaning/cooking. She left around 11 am. 

Around 4:30 there was a knock on the door. It was a sheriff there to serve me with a Civil Protection Order. She wanted me out, so she told a number of lies (I have a copy of what she said) alleging my “abuse” towards her. Including that I stole her phone and deleted “incriminating recordings” and “constant verbal abuse” and that I “throw things” and “impeded her egress from room to room.” 

Only one of the things she said was actually true, and it was the culmination of a time she and I had a really long argument and I was begging her to please just listen to me. I was sobbing and I stood in front of her and she couldn’t get around me. I’m much larger than her. I expect she thinks that will go in her favor. 

Anyway, I’m currently homeless with my two kids, and I can’t find anything online pertaining to what I can do in this situation. All the info has to do with the person who filed the order. I can’t afford a lawyer, and since this is a civil case I don’t qualify for a public defender. This is wholly and completely false, and I’m terrified. I’m in Ohio. Please please help.",JUSTNOMIL
"I’ve been a long time lurker thanks to my bestie who sends a lot of these posts to me to help me deal.

So I am newly married (less than 1 year) but hubs and I have gone through a ton since we got together ~4 years ago. All told, we lost both our fathers to cancer (his after a 2+ year battle, mine after ~9 months), we bought a house, got a cat and a puppy, got married, faced mental health diagnoses and debilitating back injuries, you name it.

When we first got together I adored my MIL- she seemed like my biggest advocate and had a huge heart. She would stand up for me when she knew we were having problems, told me she’d love me even if I didn’t stay with him, etc.

However.

More recently I’ve begun to see her behavior as super problematic and begun to realize the ways in which she has gaslit me into not noticing until now (even though my friends noticed way before I did).

On the mild end of the spectrum, MIL “pops by” to our house, often a few times a week. She makes everything about her (when a cousin had a baby in her birthday month, she said it was her bday present; FB comments congratulating us on our new puppy are about how she got to hold him, etc.). She pays for everything all the time so she can get exactly what she wants but no one can get mad at her for controlling everything because of her “generosity”. Just annoying stuff.

The more recent and awful bullshit is that she got engaged and told my husband via text message. Text. A group text, at that. I didn’t even get to find out from her, I had to find out from him after he was devastated and hurt by the news. 

Context: husband and I were contributing to HOA fees for a vacation property that was supposed to be for “the family” but all of Husbands ideas were immediately shot down even though he gave her hundreds of dollars and hours of his time and effort fixing up the property. He does a lot for her, cleaning her gutters and doing work on her home that she is rarely grateful for. Also, the guy she is marrying is all sorts of problematic (gives me a real “Dirty John”-minus-the-murder vibe if you’re familiar with the podcast), but that’s not relevant to this story. Husband has told her his issues with the guy and her response is always, “How long do you expect me to be miserable and alone?!” (With lots of tears, I must add).

So, she gets engaged and doesn’t bother to do a signature “pop in” to at least tell us in person, or at the very least call us. We also had to find out from family that she bought a $300k vacation house (she does not have the money to support multiple homes) at the request of this new fiancé. Engagement and home purchase occurred within ~2 days of each other.

We initiated NC after she was blowing up our phones, trying to use me to find husband. Husband sent her a text reading, simply, “we don’t want to talk to you. Leave us alone”. He also told her that we are no longer interested in being a part of their vacation property and that we needed space.

She couldn’t respect that and continuously called him and kept popping by our house unannounced. The last time she did it (the Friday before Mother’s Day), I inserted myself into the conversation (usually I stay out of it) because I’m just fucking done.

She went on and on about how we hurt her by not congratulating her on her engagement, how it wasn’t fair for us to be mad about the house because she was thinking of us when she bought it, how she was upset that I didn’t contact her after Husband asked for space. I tried explaining boundaries to her and telling her how her actions were hurtful. It seemed positive at the time and like we made a good step forward but here’s the problem:

She won’t stop talking about having us out to the property to visit and stay. She wants us to come with our dog multiple weekends a month, and she’s stated that “when we have kids”, she’ll watch them at the property so we can have “breaks”.

We have no interest in the property and Husband and I have already privately agreed that IF we have kids, we will not let her take them for extended stays on the property (which is on an island only accessible by private ferry and has no medical/fire/police services in case of an emergency).

She clearly wants everything to go back to the way it was, but it can’t. She doesn’t respect our personal space. No one is allowed to criticize her or her choices but she is quick to criticize my Husband and to tell me that I “act like my mother sometimes”, which she well knows is deeply insulting given my life context. She is not content with us accepting her choices even if we disagree with them, she insists that we have to be happy about them.

How on earth do I (and Husband) navigate this space? Husband is lost, since he has always gone above and beyond to take care of everyone in his family. I want to protect him (and myself!) but I don’t know how to do that without her deciding I’m a bitch and the enemy and turning this into a bigger issue with the family.",JUSTNOMIL

Our first Mother’s Day as a family of three was a rousing success. The only sin of MIL was trying to “talk” to our 8 month old DD on speakerphone. Seeing her look back at me like that confused pug gif was a present in itself.

Well. This Sunday. It appears MIL wants to do a belated Mother’s Day brunch (gag).

"I recently discovered that an aunt that I really love and sought advice from during my son’s medical treatment after he was born has been sharing every detail (and photos) with my mother after I asked her not to. 

I have been no contact for a number of years but never discussed it with most of my family and friends.  After being betrayed by someone I thought I could trust, I decided I’m tired of basically covering for her bullshit by staying silent. 

“I really am not one to air family issues semi-publicly, unfortunately I feel the need to today. This message is only viewable by my family or friends who may have contact with my mother. 

I do not wish for her to have any information about my life or photos of my child. I have already limited contact with those I feel can’t respect this. 

I shouldn’t have to justify it, but I will because I care about my family a lot and it occurred to me that people just might not know. 

The short version is this: I cut contact with her in May 2015. She continues to be toxic and manipulative to get what she wants and make people feel sorry for her. She made terrible choices with lasting consequences when I was a child and takes no responsibility. She cannot be trusted with children which is why she cannot have contact with my son. 

On the day my baby was born she broke into my house and went through my mail to find out what hospital we were at. She then refused to leave the hospital lobby while I had an unplanned c-section and He had to be transferred for serious complications. We had to plan to take him out another door to transport because she refused to leave. 

I don’t think anything more needs to be said. I am not asking you to choose. She is charming and has been close with some of you, especially my cousins. I am okay if you want to avoid the drama and just unfriend me on Facebook. I will not hold it against you and I will be happy to see you and catch up at family functions. 

I hope you understand. Thank you for reading.”

"Hello, everyone. 

My Dad's wife feels like a MIL in that she didn't used to be my family, and I didnt choose her, but with a wedding, she was made into my family.  My MIL, although imperfect, is a kind woman with good boundaries.  My Dad's wife, however, is a source of frustration and sadness for me.

She is the complete opposite of my mother, who was a classy, intelligent, progressive, financially responsible woman who died 10 years ago.  She maniulated my Dad into cutting my sister and I out of his will (a story for another time - we've come to terms with it), and for a short while tried to keep him from seeing or talking to me.  After I publicly called her out over a racist post on the Book of Faces, and she unfriended me, we came to an unspoken agreement to avoid any topic we disagree about and keep our infrequent interactions polite and surface-level.  I feel like the relationship we have now is at its maximum potential.  

She and my Dad came to see me around Mother's Day, which coincides with my birthday, to take me to dinner and drop off their gifts for my upcoming baby shower, since she'll likely miss it due to a serious family matter.  At one point, she brought up my registry, and said that while they were shopping for the shower gifts, she noticed I'd included a breast pump.  She said that when she saw that, she couldn't help but exclaim to my Dad that ""this baby's going to starve!"" because I'm so tiny.

I was taken aback because although I've been told that people will shame you regardless of how you feed your baby, I've heard and read so many positive things about breastfeeding that I assumed it would be more likely that I'd get shamed for formula feeding.  I have prepared responses for a lot of the expected unsolicited advice and belly touching, but wasn't ready for this.  So, I just said ""well, if I'm not producing enough, I plan to supplement with formula,"" which I do intend to do if I'm struggling for whatever reason and lactation consultants can't help.  There are formula-related items on my registry as well.  She acted relieved to hear that and dropped the subject.

It's still bothering me weeks later, partly because it was ignorant - a woman's size doesn't affect milk production, and partly because it was invasive and inappropriate - how my husband and I feed our child is nobody's business but our own and that of our health care team, unless we explicitly ask for input.  I wish I had responded differently, in a way that didn't seem to validate her concerns.  On top of this, my normally JY Dad's response when I expressed how difficult pregnancy has been was to awkwardly laugh and say ""well, you got yourself into this.""  Ugh, cringe.  I'm hoping writing about this visit helps purge the negativity.",JUSTNOMIL

"Definitely some BEC, but just an intro to my nMom. This is an old story from when I was a kid, and just sort of illustrates her personality. Edit: advice is welcome, but it’s an old story. :)


My mother has a knack for making me feel personally responsible for her feelings. This was especially true when it came to my clothes. I’m an only child, and was essentially a doll for her when I was young. To be fair, I was a very cute kid. 

Things started going south when I turned 11/12, as they will for pre-teens. The week before the start of middle school, we went shopping for school clothes. If my mom picked something out and I didn’t like it, her response would be to take it as a personal attack on her taste, generosity, and general mothering. I was often called ungrateful and spoiled. (Side note: if I’m spoiled, and you’re my parent.... whose fault is it?) 

So we’re in JC Penney or some other department store where I never could find things I liked, and she picks out the UGLIEST sweater I’ve ever seen. It’s chenille, but that cheap plastic-y stretchy chenille that was popular in the late 90s/00s, and it was green. Now I like green, I’m wearing a green dress right now, but this is a neon-pea electric-vomit colored mess. I hated it, and begged her not to buy it, but she was adamant that I needed a sweater and THIS monstrosity was the one I’d be wearing. I would wear it, or she would return the rest of the clothes we had just spent the last torturous hours fighting over and she’d pick out ALL of my clothes for school. Of course, I folded, and off we went, ugly sweater in hand. 

Do you think she EVER forgot to make me wear it? Of course not, she made me wear it ALL the goddamn time, including for my birthday that year. The sweater was too short, too boxy, wickedly uncomfortable, and ugly as sin, just what you want to wear as you begin puberty. 

At some point that next summer I managed to “accidentally” rip the sleeve, and my not-crafty-at-all mother actually attempted to fix it before I pointed out that it didn’t fit (never fit) and certainly wouldn’t fit by next winter. 

She keeps the photo of me on my birthday in that damn sweater on the wall in her kitchen so I see it every time I’m there. I think she likes to remind me of how terrible she could make me look. Someday I’m going to find a perfect match and gift it to her for a holiday, just to be petty.",JUSTNOMIL

"Guess who's 39 weeks + 2 days pregnant....I am. Currently I show no signs of going into labor and my OBGYN isn't gonna induce me unless I get to 41 weeks or over without going into labor naturally. (I am miserable and also nesting super hard right now.)

So we're having a baby girl and I'll be honest picking out names has been super rough because we didn't find out I was pregnant until like 30 weeks because of medical issues masking my symptoms. Neither I or my SO have important female role models in our lives that we could name our daughter after. We've managed to kinda make a list of names that we've narrowed down over time, and we excitedly talked about said names in front of FMIL once or twice. 

One of those names which is like the #1 choice in my opinion just so happens to be the name of someone's child who FMIL is really good friends with. I've never met this best friend because she happens to reside in California and we're all the way over here in Ohio. So it's not like I knew she had a child with that name or that I'll ever even meet that child.

FMIL decided to tell this friend that we considered this name for our daughter and this women had the nerve to say we can't use that name, and that we need to find our ""own"" name. (As if any name these days is exactly original unless you literally create it yourself somehow. Also the name we like is literally the name of a few female celebrities. So it's not like it's uncommon or super unique.)

Anyway. FMIL brought up what this friend said to us just recently and this isn't the only time she's told us we can't use that name because this other child is named that. Also she won't stop saying we should use another name I had brought up as an option like once. Unfortunately I absolutely hate that name now because of how much she seems to like it and because of how often she brings it up.

All of this has put a damper on my excitement to meet my daughter soon because now I'm second guessing my name choice, and I don't have a lot of time left to figure out another name SO and I both are enthusiastic about. I was already kinda referring to my daughter as said name in my head and I even mentioned the name to my OBGYN who thought it was very lovely.

I'll be honest when FMIL brought up what this friend said to us I kinda snapped back with ""well I don't know this woman or her daughter so..."". The farther along I get the less I can deal with her bullshit and the harder it gets to hold my damn tongue.",JUSTNOMIL
"\*\*Update\*\*- Instadopt got in touch with me. Aunt-in-law is showing some positive progress. They think they can hold off on surgery and she can possibly make her flight back to our home state on Sunday. Instadopt is on her way to a luau. Also, apparently they had an earthquake in Hawaii today. It has certainly been a trip for the books. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my MIL Instadopt has actually been on very good behavior since my father died. I would actually label her a JustYes the last few months. I think she truly understands the magnitude of losses I have experienced and can actually see some things through my eyes.

Instadopt's Sister my Aunt-in-law, has a milestone birthday. Aunt-in-law has been a JustNo for the last few years. To summarize things, she had uncontrolled diabetes that she refused to work on, take medication for, or heed any medical warnings for. Aunt-in-law got a blood clot in her leg at 44 yo. This was tragic. She went to have an angioplasty done on her leg. The surgeon forgot to give her blood thinners and she ended up losing the leg at 44 years old after numerous surgeries. These surgeries elevated her blood sugar and her eyesight went also (she is legally blind in both eyes now). Since then her kidneys have given out and she is on dialysis due to stage 4 kidney failure.

I have tons of empathy for Aunt-in-law. It seemed like a horrible array of tragedies to happen to one person. However, throughout the entire process, she has been completely noncompliant in terms of eating foods she is not supposed to, refusal to take medication, refusal to attend support groups, and refusal to seek counseling or a psychiatrist for her now major depression. She managed to get her GP to proscribe her an antidepressant (she self-diagnosed and told them what she wanted to take) and has also gotten hooked on painkillers throughout this process. She was a psychology undergrad and therefore she feels she doesn't need to see a psychiatrist and can self-medicate.

Instadopt has been by her side this whole time- at every hospitalization, doctor's appointment, taking time off of work, spending a few hours once a week at her place, calling every day, taking her in to help her recuperate from a few major surgeries. Aunt-in-law has been very selfish throughout, expecting Instadopt to drop everything and wait on her hand and foot. (This has also fed into my decision to delay kids because Instadopt wants to help with babysitting full time and there is no way she could do such a thing if Aunt-in-law needs her at any point).

Anyway, Aunt-in-law hit a milestone birthday and Instadopt asks her what she wants to do. Aunt-in-law wants to go to Hawaii. To be fair, Instadopt has wanted to go to Hawaii for some time, but given Aunt-in-law's health issues, the distance, etc, it didn't seem wise. However Instadopt is willing to do anything for Aunt-in-law. So the trip gets booked with ravel insurance in case of Aunt-in-law's illness flaring up.

A week ago, one of Aunt-in-law's toes on her good leg turns black. Then she gets a boil in her groin. Not long after that her doctor notices gangrene on her finger of her dialysis arm. Instadopt's DH says maybe they shouldn't go and cash in travel insurance. Instadopt tries to convince Aunt-in-law to go back to her GP or hospital to have it checked out before flight. Aunt-in-law insists a course of oral antibiotics will clear it all up. They get on a plane to Hawaii last weekend (Saturday). They arrive. Sunday morning, Aunt-in-law is rushed to the ER in Hawaii. She has been in the hospital now since Sunday and the Dr's in Hawaii says it has progressed to Cellulitis and now it may mean a toe amputation too, in addition to a strong course of IV antibiotics and surgery on the cellulitis.

Instadopt is telling the Dr. she has to be on a plane to our home state (9 hour ride) by Sunday. Dr. isn't sure. Now Instadopt is calling travel insurance to see if they will reimburse if flights have to be changed. Instadopt planned to return to work Tuesday. That's not looking good. In any event when they do get back to our home state she will have to be immediately admitted to the hospital here. The last time this happened she was in the hospital and rehab facility for months. She has a birthday brunch planned for 2 weeks after her return.",JUSTNOMIL
"Never though BIL was a flying monkey. My bad. 

I feel like JNMIL and Just no any family member are fools bc they want unlimited access to their grand baby’s but the grand baby will know how they are and will always pick the mommy. 

In my case my mother had an abusive JNMIL my JNGM who I have seen 2xs in 20 years bc I can’t stand her. I know she was horrible to my mom and she was kind of a bitch to me as a kid so once I was old enough to tell her off I did. I am 35 have seen her 2 xs since I was 15. I told her off and have zero interest in her, she pretends not to be horrid but she is. We all know she is. But I’m an adult so I don’t have to see her. My daughter will never know her. For her safety and well being, NEVER won’t even know about her.

My mom re married and her knew MIl and in-laws suck. Are they abusive no, they are just BEC and mean girl nonsense. Her husband is great, my stepfather  an amazing human and excellent father, His siblings and their wives Just awful. So once again all of her kids (me and 3 brothers) know how they treat my mom so we don’t care for them much. Are we polite? Mostly, (I’m an adult now so sometimes I will drop a snarky comment on them like ¨ I know I don’t see you that often but I wonder why grandma tells everyone you have developmental issues, you seem perfectly fine to me” ) Do we go out of our way for them hell no.  Do we see them that much NOPE. Not even for holidays.

So what is the end game for my in-laws? To win my daughter over from me? That will never happen. Even though I never bad mouth them. (Just like my mom never bad mouthed hers) she will pick up my dislike of them. What do they think will happen by systematically ignoring my wishes that I will accommodate them? They are delusional. I will see them less and less which they know because I have been seeing them less and less.  You don’t want to listen fine then I don’t have to you. 

So we are out running errands and my husband is like can we stop by to see my brother for whatever reason. I was like ok it’s just him and only for a few min. Now his mom came over last night for her weekly visit bc they were going to Athens and won’t see baby for awhile so imagine my surprise when she came outside to see The baby.  Apparently they are leaving tonight so why the rush to see the baby yesterday? Our MGG manipulation. Another weird thing FIL drove MGG over to see the baby but didn’t come inside himself.  🤷🏻‍♀️

Pretty sure this sneaky move is more on my husband triggered by MGG who has been working on him. Cause he keep asking. I told him as long as he supervises her she can visit but I won’t be their. He is like but I work. Tough cookie then, Cause as I explained she my want to see The Baby But I NEED to be respected and listened to first. 

MGG says all sorts of moronic stuff to him to manipulate him. 40 years of his moms mind fuckery is hard to break all at once. “We’re gonna die soon you have to stay in Greece forever” both of them are healthy old but healthy. This got a laugh from me when he said that to me. Cause logically it’s a fail. 

Anyways so she is their and I am like huh really. Hubby wants to do a BBQ on Sunday but they already had their visit so nope. 🤷🏻‍♀️

So MGG  is shrinking nonsense in whatever language at the baby and BIL is holding her whispering to her in Greek and the baby looks appalled. 

Hubby is sitting next to me and I text him English so he says “could you both please speak to her in English”I follow it up with “please speak calmer to her, you can still use a nice voice but she gets agitated if you talk excitedly to her, also please use proper words it’s better for a child’s mental development” cause whatever MIL was saying to her wasn’t a word in any language. 


MIL gave me a look like yeah no and BIL was like “I’m speaking Greek. She needs to learn Greek.” 

I pushed back “no she doesn’t she will learn it in school we are focusing on English with her¨ (over my dead body will she go to school in Greece. you think American schools are bad Greece is like I can top that) he pushed back again and  flat out said well “I no longer care him she learns Greek or not.” 

Husband  interjects “Speak English my wife wants to be included I will take care of teaching baby Greek” 

BIL “it’s not like I was telling her secrets” me “ regardless they are in fact secrets from me” 

Whole time MGG complaining in Greek to my husband so yes they are in fact telling secrets. 

When I mean speak English I mean do not speak Greek at all, to anyone in my presence. What they have done for years is would speak English to me but Greek to each other which is so fucking rude.  Honestly I am shocked they think this is ok. No they know it’s bad but I haven’t given a fuck before bc we would see them 3 weeks a year. So 🤷🏻‍♀️. Then we moved to Greece for my husbands work. They still did it but I did not care because I am not close with them and did not care enough to correct that behavior. 

Now I have a baby MIL proved she couldn’t be trusted by saying shitty things about hubby and me to The baby in Greek. Now I fucking care. 

Also MGG then grabbed the baby from BIL and started walking awkwardly with her. Of course the baby started screaming. You have to hold her securely. I am glad my baby is old enough now to express her displeasure. 

The hubby instantly took the baby away from MGG. On the way home he was like I wonder why that happened. - dose he really? Cause I can provide the answers. I told him and he was like no that can’t be it. 🤷🏻‍♀️  


The hubby keeps pressuring me to let his mom come over and see the baby more. We are going to have a sit down about it tomorrow and I am trying to figure out what to say. Cause it’s not going to happen. 

I can not spend more time with that women the shrieking and disrespect I can’t. 

The funny thing is HE doesn’t even want to. 

She was over last night in which I went upstairs for some peace and quite. Leaving him to supervise and interact with her. He lasted 20 min. Why would he make me suffer her if he can’t even last 20 min with her. 

He keeps saying your parents did and refuses to see the difference between them.  

It is  not logical at this point. 

How do I address this so he understand?

I point out the unsafe behaviors she has done and he is like ok I have addressed them.

I am like but what about the next unsafe thing she does? She has proven her untrustworthiness and inability to respect even the most basic current safe parenting standards. 

And he says I am irrational one because I am blaming her for something she hasn’t done yet. 

I am like no I am holding her accountable for past behavior and protecting OUR child according. 

🤷🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🙄


Edit so I got 2 post on here from a Greek troll ranting about I was at fault and Greek is a beautiful language.... both accounts new... do you think it’s my in-laws stalking me because that would be so disturbing.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hello wonderful reddit friends! Today is a good day! Maybe it’s the start of a new adventure of telling my MIL back the F off! But I know it’s going to be an adjustment for my DH. Here’s the story. 

So my phone has been dead for about two hours. Couldn’t find the charger. When I finally found it and got my phone back on, the fun began. 15 freaking text messages from my MIL in a group text with my DH came flooding in. Apparently, she decided to take her vacation during my children’s 7th birthday in about a month and a half away. Not a big deal right. Well there’s more to it. She’s not just taking her vacation the week of my children’s birthday (we already made plans) but signed my DH and I up with our kids, to go 3 STATES AWAY, out of town, to my (The Queen bee of the fly monkeys) SIL’s. She said she already told my SIL we were coming. They already told her children too. So now they are all excited to see their cousins on their birthday and 4th of July week. So now they are in the process of planning my children’s Bday party (a day before 4th of July), 3 states away,  and a 4th of July party/ graduation party for her child competing kindergarten. Apparently she had already spent lots of money on the party and reserved a party clown and bouncy house too. 

So according to my MIL (even tho she NEVER asked us if we could go) we are going. My DH works during the week so she told him to take off work, telling his boss a out right lie, that someone died in the family. So, he has to go to a funeral out of town to be their for his mother who just lost her husband too (it will be a year ago, in a week). If that doesn’t work, then just my children and I can go. See, I don’t work. So I have no obligations to stay home. I can always come. Then she text us, what the plans are. She will be picking us up the week of my boys bday, Monday at 7am in the Morning to drive 10 hours down to my SIL’s for 5 days. 

The fucking balls of this woman!!!!!! On top of never asking us if we can go and the fact that she knows I HATE My SIL. She ignores all the damn plans we have already made with my friend and her kids, for my children’s bday. We have not even set a day in stone for the bday bc it’s still 7 weeks away. But we did tell their one cousin, who lives 10 minutes away, my friend, and two other children what we are doing. They all confirmed they can come. We are going to have a cook out, cake, and a day at the beach (only 10 minute walk away from my house). Then come home, have a fire and camp out in a tent, in the back yard for the kids FIRST sleep over party. Nothing crazy but that’s why we haven’t set a day yet. Bc we need to plan it around the 10 day weather forecast. But everyone is expecting it to happen around their bday week. 

My MIL KNEW alllll about this already. I told her 2 weeks ago when she asked what our plans are for my kids bday. But nope. She don’t care. We do what she wants. End of story. WRONG! I was going to flip the F out until my DH FINALLY grew a pair and stepped in. He told her the following:

“Speechless mom. I really don’t know what to say. Except I’m sorry. We will not be joining you. You should of talked to me first.  Its a nice thought but no. Would be nice to see my sister and my nieces but not at the expense of my children’s already planned birthday party. My job mom! It’s a career! I don’t take that shit Lightly. You know how hard I worked to get were I am. If you wanted to plan a family trip, you got to TALK with me and my wife FIRST! You don’t make plans for us, 10 fucking hours away. You know I do side work too. What if I had gigs planned already. I can’t cancel. That’s my professional reputation mom and telling me to LIE about a family members death is just messed up. How do you even know, we would even have the ability to miss a whole entire weeks worth of pay!? The boys will be in soccer and science camp this summer too. Remember I told you. You know how much it costs. I got twins mom. Two summer camps on one income. They will not miss one fucking day! You knew it’s the first year they’ve ever done a camp or a sport and it’s the new neighborhood. I want the kids to make friends this summer. I want them to have a good next year in their new school. YOU will have to break the news to my nieces we will not be coming. YOU will have to fix the mess you made with my sister and any money she spent on the party she is planning. I don’t care. She ripped me off anyways when she cried the blues she had no utilities so I gave her 700 dollars she never paid back. Yea but she’s broke planning 3 parties. Whatever. I have nothing to do with this shit. 

I love you mom. You know I do. I have tried my best to keep things under control with you since your weird controlling behavior started. I’ve been trying to juggle my wife’s feelings and yours. I’ve been trying to see both sides. I do but this is wrong. It’s your way or nothing. I’m not sure why you are acting this way but it’s not ok. All your going to do is push me away. Remember I’m the only one out of all of your kids who still lives under 2 hours away from you. Everyone else is a day drive or flying distance. And If you bring dads death up as an excuse...... don’t even try it.” 

He texted her all of this in a group text. WOW!!!! I was stunned and sooooooooooo freaking happy. She responded with, “A short no would of been fine and in private. I see what’s going on. We will talk more about this when we have some privacy. Did you forget we are in a group text? I’m very hurt. I’m very very disappointed in you. Remember you are the man of the family now that your father is gone. He asked one thing of you before he died and that was to take care of me and look out for your sisters. What would he think now😞 I understand you don’t have to come on the trip. But think about what I said bc you really hurt me son.”

He didn’t respond to her But he did text me.

“There..... are you happy!? I choose you and not her. I did what u wanted. Now I feel like shit. But at least we aren’t going on the trip.”",JUSTNOMIL
"So after reading some more of your stories, I decided to share a story of my MIL and wedding planning. Feel free to add your own to this.

I just don't understand people and the trying to invite/throw parties and their excuse is ""But they will get you gifts!""

I ended up not having a Bridal Shower because my MIL wanted to throw me one (my mom lives far away) and MIL didn't even ask if my MOH was throwing one for me instead. She just simply assumed she would throw me one and invite all of her society friends that I had never met before to it. No asking me, no discussing a guest list, NOTHING! So I shut it down and said no thank you. Out comes the ""But you will get lots of presents!"" ""I do not feel right having a party with a bunch of people I don't know just so I can get stuff"". Evidently this was completely foreign to her because this is what all of her society friends did and now it was her turn to cash in. I was just floored. 

So needless to say, I did not get a Bridal Shower because I refused to let MIL throw one for all her little friends (and in a JustNoSO moment, DH refused to let me have one from someone else as it would hurt his mommy's fee fees *eye roll* )",JUSTNOMIL
"When husband and I got married we were poor. We had lived together for three years. We didn't really need house stuff. So we decided not to register for gifts and just ask for cash/gift cards.

WELL. MIL found out about this and told husband that is TACKY. She can't go to her relatives and tell them we want cash! We have to have a registry. 

Ok fine. I created a registry at Macy's and Target. And I registered for so much random shit you guys. I can't remember all of it but it did include these items: a garden hose, a lawn gnome, power tools, window blinds, and an ice cream maker. Most of our friends knew we wanted cash and gave us money gifts. I did get the ice cream maker. Husband got power tools. We did not get the gnome 😪. 

Honestly, the registries for both places were obnoxiously long. 

So if your MIL is trying to fuck with your registry, troll her with your registry. Good luck!",JUSTNOMIL
"BF has been NC with MIL for about 7 months now. He has her number blocked and wants me to do the same. He is incredibly emotional about this and sees me refusing to block her number as me “being in contact with someone who kept me captive” (his exact words - I do not speak to her at all). 

I do not want to block her number because I want to be able to document any contact she tries to have with me. She very much blames me for BF going NC - I actually encouraged him to reach out to her on Christmas and he refused so she is wrong. So I am afraid that her anger will be directed at me if we experience an extinction burst. 

Another reason I don’t want to block her is so that we have a heads up if an extinction burst is coming. BF had 10+ voicemails (in a blocked folder) from her yesterday but I have nothing. If she is really serious about losing her mind I think I will at least get a text and then we will know something is up. 

BF is very emotional about this and I feel bad that I am making it worse, but I am also affected by her crazy and I feel like I have a right to do what I want to do in terms of my phone. He is so blinded by his rage towards her that he doesn’t get that I am scared too, and this is how I prefer to deal with it. AITA?

EDIT: thank you all for your responses - most were super helpful/gentle and I appreciate that. Just want to clear some things up: 1. I did block her number and BF agreed to split the cost of security cameras with me. 2. If I had not blocked her, if she were to text me I would not respond. We are not in contact whatsoever. 3. Maybe “encouraged” was the wrong word. I loathe MIL and wish BF would’ve cut contact years ago but tried not to push my opinion on him because I didn’t want to drive a wedge anywhere that wasn’t my business. He expressed his guilt about not planning to speak with MIL and I offered to change my plans to go with him so he didn’t have to go alone. It upsets me that anyone would think I pushed him towards his abuser because I don’t feel that was the case. We have both been abused by MIL and we are trying to navigate this together. I would appreciate it if the comments didn’t focus on my (admittedly wrong) actions around the holidays. Thank you.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi everyone! It’s been a rough couple of days, but I’m still here. I don’t know if I said this already, but I made it to the interview, and I got an offer for the job yesterday. I panicked, I wasn’t sure if I should take it or not (They offered me less money than I thought I’d be working for, and I’m a little worried my hours might have gotten mixed up, but I can always ask about that) but I think I’m going to.

But I’m really worried over what I’m gonna tell my mom and dad. Mom’s going to prod and ask a million questions, and then she’ll use Dad to tell me what I can and can’t do because she knows we don’t dare argue with him. I’m at a point right now where I just want to say “I’m going to work” and stay silent when she does the whole interrogation, or just respond to everything with, “You don’t like it when I talk about jobs.”

What I’m even more worried about is that they might refuse to let me use the car. I don’t know if that counts as refusing to let someone leave the house, so I don’t know what I’m going to do if that happens. (But that’s another reason I really should take this job, so I can at least start saving up for my own car.)

Does anyone have any advice as to what I should do if they ask? And what if they do refuse to let me use the car? If they find out I took the job behind their backs after they told me I shouldn’t, they’ll be furious. (And while we’re at it, what’s the minimum amount of money you should save up for a car, anyway? I’ve heard of saving at least $5,000 so you don’t have to spend a ton on repairs?)

Thank you for reading. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",JUSTNOMIL
"DH has now returned from his home town. 


The report on Obliviouranus (JNMIL) was completely unsurprising. She's in a ""flat spin"". Continuing to do the exact behaviours I cut her off for in the first place. I have enacted the consequences of no contact with a minimum period of 6 months.  This applies to Obliviouranus, BIL and SIL. FIL has kept the door open to talking to me and at some point I will talk to him. He is as much a victim of Obliviouranus as GMIL, DD, and me. I also dearly love him and want to have a relationship with him.


DH and I discussed how no contact can end. Taking all of your suggestions on board I said that an admittance of wrongdoing, genuine remorse for past actions, a sustained change in behaviour, and continued adherence to our boundaries for the next 6 months would be a good start. Professional help for what is looking like a textbook case of NPD would go a long way. That is unlikely given the nature of NPD and the narcissist lacking capacity for empathy and insight. I also put in a new boundary - I will not be taking on the role of scapegoat again. He wasn't even aware that's what it was and what I did at his request. I explained it in the framework of NPD and he understood. 


GMIL has finally reached a place of acceptance about going into care. DH and BIL have taken the lead with her consultation and approval. I think she understands that getting away from Obliviouranus is the right move. At least in that respect I feel as though I did all I could and we got a good outcome for GMIL.


I will continue my own therapeutic journey alone.  I have suggested to DH he does the same as he needs someone to talk to as well and I'm sick of talking about his mother with him.  He was profusely apologetic about making the call to separate our family on the faaaaaamily holiday. I politely informed him that me and DD will not be going on said holiday. Discussion ensued. DH also doesn't want to go on holiday with his faaaaaamily (quelle surprise). We will do something together, Just the 3 of us, instead.


When we tell the faaaaamily we're not going on holiday with them there will no doubt be more tantrums from Obliviouranus. Not my circus, not my monkey's. DH can tell them. It would only cause more headaches us being there than not. Let them enjoy their holiday and the consequences of their actions.


So, for now, it's over. Thank you again for all the supportive comments and DM's. I couldn't have taken out the trash without you all and now my part in this saga comes to an end.....I hope!!


EDIT: All y'all that said ""It ain't over"" have an updoot. Obliviouranus has finally emailed back. Did I read it? No. Didn't even open it. Moved it straight into the folder with all the other garbage I've collected about this saga. Her behaviour since sending the email, and the 9 days it took for her to reply, said more than whatever trash she's written to try and get her way on the faaaaaamily holiday. She doesn't even know we're not going yet lol. I'll wait till that bombshell drops and let DH deal with the fallout, then I might read it and laugh at her pathetically manipulative tactics. NC is NC. I'm not even interested.",JUSTNOMIL
"Hi y’all, back again for the second time today. If you look back at my post history, you’ll see that earlier I posted about how Margot (my now JNMom) was upset I posted a status on bookface about my baby without informing her first, as I’m not sure how to attach previous post from mobile. 

Little side note: I just hit 20 weeks Tuesday, had an OB visit that same day. Little girl is weighing in at 13 oz and right on track. Hubby and I are so excited! (This plays a role in this post)


Earlier today, I posted a status all excited about how baby girl was growing and how she refused to stop moving during the ultrasound. It was meant to be a happy post, and a happy time for everyone. Turns out, it wasn’t. 

Margot sends me a text stating that it would have been nice to hear the news first before posting it on Facebook. Asking why, she said because she had to find out when or after everyone else (This included my father). 
 
I made note to let her know that no one knew the information, including my father, before posting it. I made a comment stating that she found out just like everyone else on Facebook. She FLIPPED!! 

Margot said she wasn’t “everyone else” and should get to know before hand, because she believed we were closer than her finding out a different way. Margot went on to say how I had hurt her by saying she was just like everyone else, and how it wasn’t right that I didn’t tell her about MY baby before posting it for everyone to see. 

Margot decides to message my sister screenshots of our texts, but little known to her, I was with my sister helping out at her place. I explained my side to said sister, who agreed that I had done nothing wrong by posting without addressing my mother first. We’re both grown adults and moved away, yet Margot seems to believe she can still tell us what to do. She learned today she couldn’t. 

After hours of going back and forth, my JustNo step mother decides to jump in, messaging my sister and I in a group message. She begins by saying how she will not allow anyone to hurt Margot any longer, including us. Continues by saying how Margot is on the verge of hurting herself because of the drama going on and how it is strictly my fault. She made it a point that if anything were to happen to Margot, she would never forgive me. 

This is where I had enough (as if before wasn’t the breaking point). I let my step mother know that she is responsible for getting her spouse help, and if she refused and something happened to Margot, it would be strictly her fault and no one else’s. Of course, step mother tried to deny this, saying I pushed her to do it. So, I called the cops! 

Sheriff calls me to ask what’s going on after stopping by Margot’s home and she wasn’t there. Super nice guy, I explained it to him and said that I didn’t receive any direct threats from Margot, but from my step mother who was talking to her; Margot refused to answer me or my sister. Because Margot was still at work, this guy calls over to another city to have a unit sent to her work!! She was embarrassed to say the least. 

Furious about being embarrassed, Margot finally messages me and says never to do it again. I informed her that if she refused to get help, or step mother refused to get her help, than I would gladly call the cops again if it meant knowing she was safe. Margot must not have realized we knew this was her manipulation tactic, as she has used it before. Made a point to let me and my sister know she would never tell anyone before she hurt herself/committed suicide before doing so, not even step mother. 

Then the final breaking point of it all: Step mother sends a text to both me and my sister, stating that hers and Margot’s lives no longer concern us and not to get in contact with them. Uh, okay? 

Margot finds out about this in a group message between me, her and my sister. She tries to backtrack what step mother said by saying she never said that, she just wanted a break from us and that what she says goes. NOPE! Not going to work for me. I let her know that no matter how mad you may be at your children, you NEVER tell them you don’t want them apart of your lives anymore. Especially over nothing! Step mother (who has never had kids) made a comment about how I will learn when my little girl says that to me when she’s older. When asking what she meant, step mother said I told Margot she didn’t matter and was just like everyone else. The problem is, I never said either of those things. Step mother also made it a point to let us know that if anything happens to Margot, neither will text, call or email about her to let us know she is okay. 

We finally get down to the last few texts, and I made the clear decision to cut step mother out of my life completely, and Margot and I are taking a long break. Poor sister was dragged into this by Margot and step mother, wanting her to be on their side. Both frustrated when she refused to take sides and told Margot everything she didn’t want to hear. She didn’t do anything wrong, but had it taken out on her right along side me. 

Basically, Margot got upset I didn’t tell her the baby’s weight before posting it on bookface for everyone to see, threatened to hurt herself over it and then gets pissed off when I called the cops to check on her. Step mother will no longer be apart of my life, neither her nor Margot will be getting any updates on my little girl,  and Margot and I are on a long break from any sort of communication. 

What was supposed to be such an exciting time has turned miserable. Only my father will get to know anything going on with the baby from here on out, and DH and I decided to keep everything relating to our little girl off bookface entirely. 

That’s all for now! We will see how long Margot holds her silence towards me and my sister.",JUSTNOMIL
"First time poster, so here’s a bit of backstory... 

My MIL and I haven’t had the best relationship. She was dismissive and near silent the first time I met her, and she proceeded to tell my DH that I was using him for his money (we both worked retail and at the time I made more money than him) later that day after I had gone home. When my husband told his parents he was going to propose to me she wasn’t exactly supportive, and later that year when we informed them we would be moving our intended 2020 wedding date up two years (to save $400 a month in insurance as my husband was going to change jobs) her words were “this isn’t an invitation to have children.” She has not been supportive of our marriage and has called me his girlfriend time and time again, only truly acknowledging our marital status once. My husband worked for his uncle for a spell ((this was the job he went to that caused us to get married to save money)) before leaving that company to work for another; at a family dinner his uncle asked what the benefits of the new job were in comparison to those at his company and before my husband could answer MIL said “HE WOULDN’T KNOW, they decided “LETS GET MARRIED” instead of looking into it!!!!” It was loud and awkward and pissed me the hell off as NO ONE reacted. These are the most obvious examples of the strained relationship that are necessary to share.

Onto the point of this post...

Sometime last year MIL (who can’t be taller than 5’ 1”) got herself a brand new yee yee truck that’s entirely too large for her; she only drives herself around as two of her three children don’t live at home and the youngest has his own truck for transport and she never hauls anything anywhere. Early this year she left my (now mostly JustNo) FIL. A few months ago she signed a lease on a duplex before checking if the yee yee truck fit in her garage. It technically fits, but she is by no means a small woman and it’s not comfortable to get in and out. She also already damaged the back wall of the garage while backing in.

My husband and BIL took a few loads of things while she was moving in and MIL realized that his truck fit in her garage perfectly. So she propositioned husband... why don’t we swap trucks? They would continue to pay the same truck payments (hers is less as she put more money down) because they’re due to pay their trucks off at the same time, and then once they’re paid off in full my husband and I will begin to pay her the difference.

I said no.

My husband and I recently bought our first home. The neighborhood we live in is safe, though cars parked on the street are prone to being broken into. Especially if they’re brand new. My MIL’s giant truck likely won’t fit through our fence (my husband already has to pull in slowly to make sure he doesn’t do any damage) and I don’t want him parking on the street every night.

My husband relayed the message. About a week later she propositions him again. All the same details as before but this time we don’t pay a difference. I guess she thought that paying the difference was my big issue. I told husband no, again, for the same reasons as before. Only this time I tell him it’s neither of our fault that she chose to leave his father and rent a duplex before making sure her truck fit not is it our fault that she continues to choose such large vehicles. I suggest that she trade her truck in for a smaller vehicle and he says she’ll never do that. Annoyed, my response was “oh well 🤷🏽‍♀️” and I ended the conversation.

Today he informs me that she’s brought it al up again. Her “new idea” is that we don’t have to pay a difference for the truck... aka the last thing I said no to. I said no again, but he can’t seem to understand why I won’t try to help his mom out.

Am I overreacting by saying no? Is it justifiable that I’m so angry that she’s trying to play us by suggesting the same thing (twice!) and presenting it as a new, better for us plan a few months later as though she’s helping US? And why the fresh hell will she only ask him this, but never bring it up when I’m around (granted, this isn’t often as I’ve taken the opportunity to be LC with both of my in laws since they split.)",JUSTNOMIL
"LTL, Mobile so sorry for format, Rant but advice wanted, am I overreacting?

My mom was not always a JN, most of the time she was a JY but after being introduced to this group and recent events I’m not sure anymore. I know others have it way waaay worse than me but these are just the straws finally breaking backs. 

I am 23 and have lived with my boyfriend for over a year now. I’m a huge nerd and have always wanted to go to the big city comic on in my state; been something I’ve wanted to do and vocalized to both parents since middle school but I haven’t got to go yet due to financial stuff. My mom says it’s a waste of money, not fun, super crowded, etc etc. I was gonna go this year which I told her about but my Life happened and I couldn’t go and again she said it wouldn’t be fun and what not. Well get a picture and it’s my mom dressed as an Xman character that she chose due to the stripe in her hair (looked good not gonna lie) and asked how I liked her costume. I was like ok what’s it for? And she said “oh me and GC little sister are going to comic con in 2 wks. It was a spur of the moment thing.” 

Clearly the hell not if BOTH of you ordered costumes 2 MONTHS PRIOR to said event after I told you I couldn’t go and ridiculed me for wanting to go in the first place. “Oh we are going to a smaller comic event first and didn’t even think about comic con until just now and GC really REAALLY wanted to go!” So she says she orders the tickets for her, GC and brother but that I can come to; tickets are sold out and again no cash. Brother doesn’t wanna go so he says I can have his ticket. Crisis averted, I get to go right? 

Turns out she didn’t order the third ticket because she knew brother didn’t wanna go even though I offered to pay her back for the ticket once I got paid 4 days later. Apparently, she didn’t have the money to buy all three tickets but was going to pay for my brothers? 

And now I find out from a third party that she’s been planning this huge Disney trip but hasn’t said anything to me about it. Like am I overreacting? It just hurts being excluded and being the last to know.  Thanks for making it this far!",JUSTNOMIL
"I hate that title, but we have mostly good news! Every bit of tissue removed was precancerous, high-grade/severe dysplasia, so no treatment needed, everything has been removed, just close monitoring, regular blood tests and other unpleasantness to ensure it doesn’t reach that point again, spread or develop into cancer. His doctor is getting a big old bottle of booze for being the only one in nearly 20 years to take his family health history seriously. If I wasn’t married I’d kiss that man on the mouth.  Might still, Idk he’s pretty much given my spouse 60+ more years on this flying rock. Said if he had gotten this done a year from now it may well have been too late. 

We ended up telling one very dear friend and one of my siblings. Not (feeling like) having to tell SMIL, my NM, or AIL was the best decision. Not having to comfort other people or put their feelings first was absolutely the right choice. I feel so much lighter realizing that I don’t have to tell anyone anything, moments of guilt happen, but it’s worth the freedom to focus on my family than how others feel. 

We’re going to continue NC with SMIL since the trash took itself out there. My mom will remain on a strict info diet since she’s mostly BEC and we’re like 5,000 miles away and the JustNo moments really only happen in person and no bitch I will not be building a house on your dream cult like compound. AIL will remain on LC because I just don’t give a shit anymore. 

I’ve got my DH and our LOs, we’re healthy, happy, and planning more amazing trips just the 6 of us, further hammering the point home that WE are a family and everyone else is extended, and unnecessary in our every day life/ life choices. 

Thanks again to every who offered advice, [thoughts and prayers](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/uNchJ) crystals and whatever deity you believe in. It gave us a bit of a spine shine, and a lot of comfort these last few weeks.",JUSTNOMIL
"I've been reading through this sub for some day now and I realised I got myself a full grown JNMIL. So I decided to share some of the good stories - partially to finally heal and partially to give some of you out there that it is possible to transform a JNMIL to a slightly annoying MIL. 

I met my DH when i was 19 and about to move to another city 2h away to continue my study. It was the kind of meeting where you immediately know you met your soulmate, the person you are going to spend the rest of your life with. So we did the only logical thing and decided to move together after knowing each other for only a couple of months. My parents were excited for us and on board with the plan. 

His parents on the other hand.. well.. Let me tell you about first meeting my MIL. Before we moved in together I've seen her only once for a brief moment. She was close to her 60th birthday rocking long peroxide blonde hair, tight glittery jeans and a ""shirt"" I'd call a bra at best. She was nice I guess, but I was far too distracted by her looks to actually focus on the conversation. I won't talk too much about my FIL, just as a side note, he got the nickname Teletubbie from my parents - and that sums up his looks, attitude, behaviour and pure essence of his being. 

DH is a smart dude and over the years living with her he has became a master of avoiding triggering drama (no shiny spine was to be found there). So he never told her he is moving out, until the day he simply packed up his tings and left. Back then I thought it was an asshole move and gave him a hard time for it. I wanted a nice relationship with my MIL and was blaming him for ruining it. Boy, I was wrong. 

After some weeks of NC they decided to come and visit their son, to see how he lives and if he's doing ok. I did my absolute best, cleaning up for days, planing what we could do and how I'll apologise for DHs behaviour to put everything back in line. 

So the big day came, they walk into my house without as much as saying hello to me, just focusing on their baby boy, having a short look around the place, acting like it's the worst shithole they ever seen and asking DH to go out for lunch with them. DH said something like ""sure WE will go to lunch with you."", what made her decently unhappy(er). We sat down and had a long conversation about how my parents and family as a whole are horrible people for having some extra money, how my childhood must have been hell (my mom was putting down a pretty awesome career) and basically how everyone i ever knew was a shithed - she did her research. Then we went down the ""she is so amazing, and smart and pretty and ..."" road, followed by what i great mom she was. 4h of my life I'll never get back. But at least she talked to me, I thought. 

It was getting dark and that meant it was almost over, we were standing in front of our apartment building and saying goodbye, and I started slowly relaxing, she even went in for a fucking hug. I thought I made it. But then it came - she turned to DH, looked at him and ""You know we love you, no matter the people you decide to let close to you. I'm telling you this is not a safe place and money makes people ugly. You should go searching for love, not money. Whenever you decide it's time for you to come back home you're always welcome, just call whenever and me and daddy will come to pick you up."" And they left. We stood there, both, in shock. 

And that was the first of many JN my lovely MIL pulled. They got worse with time progressing and no one doing anything about it. But that's stories for another time. 

Also: I'm taking suggestions for a nickname since the ones given to her by my family are too harsh and NSFW.",JUSTNOMIL
"I'm not sure where to start on this, I'm 22F and my boyfriend (BF) is 23M and we have been together for 1 year and 3 months. We have lived together at my parents house for a year (fast I know but we knew each other before we got together officially) and we are smitten. My BF and I have discussed marriage and our future together in depth and are extremely excited about our lives. The only problem lies with my boyfriend's mum (FMIL = future mother in law) and by extension his close family (dad &amp; younger brother). A bit of background about FMIL is she lost her mother two years ago in a tragic way and has unfortunately not coped with it well at all, she is in deep, deep grief and is still very affected by what happened.

&amp;#x200B;

My BF works as a chef, if anyone knows about that trade then they understand the hard, unfriendly hours they work. He often works 7am-10pm shifts with a 30 min break in between. He can usually squeeze one day off a week and if he is very lucky he gets two days. This has been his life since he has been 18 and he hates it. He feels he was pushed into this trade by his parents and he his very stressed and emotionally drained, when he gets a day off he likes to catch up on sleep, relax and play some video games but we have still managed to see his family at least once a month since we moved in together.

&amp;#x200B;

My FMIL calls my BF and asks when his next day off is, he doesn't know as his schedule is never updated un till a day or two in advance and constantly changes but he says he will tell her when he knows. He rings her and tells her the day off when he finds out and she replied asking if we wanted to meet up in the city and he said maybe but he'll text her and tell her closer to the day. It turns out my BF's kitchen chef was on holiday so he had to pick up their jobs as well as his own so he was extra exhausted this day off and just wanted to sleep. He text his mum that he wasn't going to meet up and we didn't think much of it until 2pm the next day when his was phone was blowing up with phone calls and messages from his mum and brother. He answered and she said she was in the city, where was he? He said he text to say he wasn't coming and she said he didn't and she was waiting for him. My BF said he wasn't even dressed and the call ended. His brother then started messaging telling him he knew mum missed him, how could he do that to her, a lot of things a long the line of that. He offered to take them to a meal on his next day off and everything seemed to calm down.

&amp;#x200B;

We both went to the meal and it went well, no one talked about what happened and we had a fun time. A few days later there was an emergency in my family and I accidentally called 'dad' on my BF's phone instead of my own but he didn't answer. I realised my mistake and tried phoning my dad on my phone when my phone started blowing up. I was desperately trying to get a hold of my dad but every time I tried to ring him I couldn't has they where ringing me. I wasn't interested in talking to them as I was worried about my dad so I messaged the brother to please stop ringing me. He didn't stop and at this point I was frustrated and said can you please stop spamming me, there are other people in the world who have things to do, or something to that effect. The calls stopped and I was finally able to ring my dad and get ahold of him (he's okay btw) and didn't think much of it.

&amp;#x200B;

A few days later my boyfriend gets a call from his mum, he puts it on loudspeaker because he was gaming at the time. The first thing she says is ""Are you with HER"" I immediately looked at him and he gave me a funny look and responded with ""no?"" and his mum said good ""I don't like her, I don't like how she talked to your brother, I think she is really rude"" my BF looks shocked and we both are looking at each other open mouth and before he can answer she says ""are you still planning on doing that engagement thing?"" and he answered ""yes"" and she said ""oh..."" in a very sad trailed off way. The call ends and we are both wondering where that came from, my BF's dad's birthday was coming up soon and we knew we where seeing them in a few days so my BF text them something like ""I don't like how you talked about someone I care for and I don't want you to start anything so we won't be coming to dad's birthday"" She responded how I should of told them that he was okay as they where worried about him because his dad got a missed call and my BF stood his ground and said that he doesn't think I was in the wrong and that he wouldn't agree with what she was saying. She then sent him this text message which has really been making me feel uncomfortable, here it is copy and pasted:

""You don't know how much I miss you, some nights I cry because I don't see you. I miss your smell your smile and the sound of your voice. I'm happy that you have met someone that makes you happy and sometimes that's hard for me to know someone else is giving you a kiss and a cuddle every day and I cant do that. It was so hard when I lost my mom and now it feels like I have lost you 😭""

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know where this came from, he told me her rarely saw her at home because of how much he worked. It made me think about a few things that had happened in the past with her that I didn't really take notice of. She posts about her mum on Facebook anywhere from 1-6 times a day and recently she has started adding my BF into the posts acting like he has passed on as well.

&amp;#x200B;

My BF texted his dad as he was worried about what his mum said he told him that she misses her family but made sure to name them all but not me. It was just strange. It has been a few days now and his dad's Birthday was today, I sent him a gift and a card from both of us and my BF text him to ask if he received it and said it was from both of us and he just replied he got it and thanks \*insert BF's name\* and later when he opened it he texted my boyfriend to thank him, but made sure to just put his name and not thank me either.

&amp;#x200B;

I am so confused as to what is happening, does she think I have replaced her son? She has always done little digs at me, like when we go out she uses a calculator app to total up our food for us to pay but we always offer to get theres and she always asked about my BF and doesn't really seem that interested in me but I just chalked that up to me being a bit new for her. It has made me feel like they where waiting for an opportunity to validate disliking me and now we're in this awkward position of not knowing what to do. If she knew how much I did behind the scenes maybe she wouldn't think of me so negatively, I have to push my BF to text them back and often end up doing it myself, he won't ring them back, I literally have to start the call and then he has no choice but to talk to them. I buy and send all the presents for his mum, dad and brother since we've been together for every occasion. I push him to visit them and talk to them when we do go but now I'm the enemy?  Also she doesn't know any of this stuff and doesn't know I am aware of what she has said.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry this has been so long but I am really trying to stop him losing his family, but he thinks we should cut contact until they treat us equally, what are your opinions?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: My boyfriend's mum may think I have replaced her in his life and dislikes me but doesn't know that I am aware. How can we move forward?",JUSTNOMIL
"Or not. We dunno yet. Hes apparently been slacking on his fines since hes on probation. Hes also due back in court next month. Or so QBR said in her very whiney cry screaming voicemail she left DH this afternoon.

I was taking a nap with my kittens and his phone rang and it was her. The phone woke me up and I asked who it was. The look on his face told me everything. He was pissed.

Dh: my mom..probably leaving a long ass voicemail even though she knows I'm trying to call back.

He then listens to the voicemail and shes scream crying that she needs money, any money cuz she has none.

QBR: DH, I need money, ANY MONEY, RIGHT NOW! AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! my powers getting turned off. Dad hasn't paid his fines and is going to jail unless we pay them! GCSIL won't help us and BIL isnt speaking to us. I just need money. Anything. Call me back. *sniffles* i loooove you.

DH is fucking raging. Calls her back and she repeats herself but wont explain where all their money went. He explains that he can't help them either because him ""working for her insurance"" royalty screwed us. I lost my health insurance, food stamps, and now have to pay hundreds out of my pocket for my drs and my medicines. Also now what little food stamps we got are gone so that's even more we have to come up with.

She didn't care. She still had the balls to ask for help with money. Even asking DH if he would just borrow it from my mom. He said, again, NO. And repeated that cuz of her dumb idea we need the money and can't afford to give it to her. She gets upset and hes rolling his eyes and rubbing his temples as hes talking to her. I'm covered in adorable fluffy babies who are trying to get his attention. Finally he says ""I'll let u know"" and just hangs up. Then the fluffiest one attacked his toes.

He did say that when he gets paid by our landlord for fixing his ""older than jesus christ"" mini van he would help. But what he didn't tell her is, it's just coming off the rent. And that van's never getting fixed, it's too fucking old. Play bitch games.

"Maybe it's the hormones. When MIL found out about my pregnancy, she was overly ecstatic. Not because she was happy for us, but because she had been talking about wanting grandchildren for YEARS even before DH and I got engaged.

We knew she had been collecting baby stuff for years. Books, blankets, etc ""for all her grandbabies to use"" that she keeps at her house. Totally fine... because they're kept at her house. Now that I'm pregnant, she's started buying clothes. When she told me she ordered some stuff, she mentioned it was getting shipped to our house. I said thanks so much because we haven't bought anything yet and these would be the first items LO officially owns. Then she said ""well, when LO grows out of them, please send them back to me so that BIL and SIL can use them for their LOs.""  Sorry, what? BIL is married to a model. His wife is a size zero and has made it very very clear that she is nowhere near ready to have kids yet because her image is her brand and she doesn't want to give it up, at least for the next 10 years. SIL is unmarried, not dating, and has stated she only ever wants to be the cool aunt. She's very clearly not ready to have kids either. 

For the foreseeable future, DH and I are going to be the only couple with children. Why can't she buy clothing items or books that are specifically for our baby? Is he/she not special enough to get their own blankets and toys and pjs? I feel like LO should be treated an individual, not just the first round of grandbabies.. Clearly the package she ordered is going to come to our house. I plan on sending it back or getting it forwarded to her house.

Am I in the wrong here for being ungrateful for these ""gifts""?  It's very likely we'll have another baby in the next few years and (never say never) BIL and SIL won't be trying to have kids yet. I'm not against hand-me-downs at all, but I wish she'd treat LO like an individual person.",JUSTNOMIL
"Warnings: new poster, not on mobil, spelling is my own fault since english is my native tongue.

TLDR at end

Basic background on this, i have had ""two"" relationships, the reason for the quotation marks is because one wasn't official and ended before anything really happened (important later on).

I don't know where to post this, and give it to me straight as well please

So onto the story

My (possible) JNMom and i are close, in looks and in a bond. But there is one thing that always bothers me, and its her involving herself in my relationships, friend and more. So i'm a sophomore in high school and have only had two relationships, one i ended myself and one was ended by him.

The first relationship was ended by him, but finding out, my mom has a blabber mouth, and spills almost everything i ask her to keep secret. the gut broke up with me over text after a couple months. i'm obviously upset, and i'm crying in my room. then in comes mom. she trying to console me since he was the first guy to like me back, and she accidentally lets it slip when she was talking to his mom she mentioned me liking him (or something like that, its been over a year since that incident) and i started crying harder and kicked her out of my room because i swear she caused the breakup because his mom can be over protective. 

Turn around to my second relationship with a guy i will call Richard, for many a reasons. i ended it with him last June after a fallout of sorts. Turn around months later and he starts dating my ""Little sister"" ( a friend). she's a freshie and he's a senior, so slight problem in my eyes. I dont like the relationship and they have been dating for a few weeks at most. Heres where my mom comes in. She knows i dont like that relationship. While i was at an award show, my parents went out and were having fun when she sees his dad and my ""little sis"", hes no where to be found. later, she sees them all three of them. She never told me until today. which is the breaking point for me. because that was last weekend

im worried shes going to continue to do this shit. So, am i over reacting?

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR: Mom has ruined a relationship in past for me. Blabber mouth to others and hides secrets from me about ex and ""Little sis"" relationship which i don't condemn because of freshie and senior ages.",JUSTNOMIL
